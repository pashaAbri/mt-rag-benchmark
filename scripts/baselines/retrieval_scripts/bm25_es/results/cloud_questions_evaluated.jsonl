These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00512-1696-3972","score":15.359576,"text":"\nDocuments with similar document IDs are unlikely to be placed onto the same shard.\n\nA non-partitioned database offers only global querying, described in more detail later.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases \n\nA partitioned database is the newest type of IBM Cloudant database. Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00513-7-2197","score":14.605831,"text":"\nDatabase overview \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae databases contain JSON objects.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns.

Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice.

In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier.

It contains data that is sorted by the fields you specify, for example, books that are sorted by date and title. If you perform a query that asks for data that matches a document's date and title, the indexed data structure can be used to speed up the query process. Instead of scanning through every document in turn, IBM Cloudant can jump to the relevant part of the index (say, the section on 20th century books) and retrieve the data much more quickly.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query indexes include two types of indexes: type=json and type=text. These indexes are backed by two underlying indexing technologies that we meet in subsequent parts of this course.\n\nAn index is defined when you POST some JSON to a database's _index endpoint.\n\nThe index object contains a fields array, which specifies which document attributes to index. Usually, the fields that need indexing are equivalent to the attributes used in the selector of a query you're going to use to retrieve the data. That is, if you need to query by the date field, we need to index the date field.\n\nAlthough the name of an index is optional, it's good practice and we follow this convention. It's good to ask IBM Cloudant a question and specify the name of the index you intend it to use. This practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00576-7385-9302","score":52.28768,"text":"\nIBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized.

This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly. Deleting an IBM Cloudant document leaves a tombstone document behind, so don't rely on deleting documents to recover disk space. Instead, you must rely on deleting whole databases.\n\nJSON doesn't offer a native way to store dates or timestamps. Choose your [date format](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2018\/05\/24\/Date-formats.html) carefully if you intend to query it later.\n\nThe maximum document size is 1 MB, but documents must be much smaller than that size, typically a few KB.\n\nFor more information, see the following blog posts:\n\n\n\n* [Optimal IBM Cloudant Indexing](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/05\/10\/Optimal-Cloudant-Indexing.html)\n* [Time-series Data Storage](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/04\/08\/Time-series-data-storage.html)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00579-1483-3406","score":50.508587,"text":"\nSince the index does not store the document, you can access any field without thinking ahead about what to store in the index.\n* The disadvantage is that getting the document back is more costly than the alternative of emitting data into the index itself. First, the database has to look up the requested key in the index and then read the associated document. Also, if you\u2019re reading the whole document, but need only a single field, you\u2019re making the database read and transmit data that you don\u2019t need.\n\n\n\nThis example also means that a potential race condition exists here. The document might change, or be deleted, between the index and document read (although unlikely in practice).\n\nEmitting data into the index (a so-called \u201cprojection\u201d in relational algebra terms) means that you can fine-tune the exact subset of the document that you need. In other words, you don\u2019t need to emit the whole document. Emit a value that represents only the data you need in the app that is a cut-down object with minimal details, for example:\n\nemit(doc.indexed_field, {name: doc.name, dob: doc.dob});\n\nIf you change your mind on what fields you want to emit, the index needs rebuilding.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query\u2019s JSON indexes use views this way under the hood.

If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type.

Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-7918-10060","score":50.405888,"text":"\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6309297536,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6309297536,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6309297536}}

Now the model is immutable. To add an order, I create a new order document in the database, which cannot generate conflicts.\n\nTo be able to retrieve all orders for a specific customer, we can employ a view, which we cover later.\n\nAvoid constructs that rely on updates to parts of existing documents, where possible. Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00576-6036-7924","score":81.76308,"text":"\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/databases-for-postgresql).\n* Data warehouse for ad hoc querying.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00533-1561-3443","score":79.91905,"text":"\nAt those times, IBM Cloudant returns the document normally, as though no conflict exists.

If you try to update a document while you're offline, IBM Cloudant can't check for potential conflicts, and you don't receive a 409 response.\n\nWhen this situation happens, it's best to check for document conflicts when you're back online.

What happens if I need more? \n\nYes, 100 is the current bucket limit. Generally, prefixes are a better way to group objects in a bucket, unless the data needs to be in a different region or storage class. For example, to group patient records, you would use one prefix per patient. If this is not a workable solution and you require additional buckets, contact IBM customer support.\n\n\n\n\n\n If I want to store my data by using IBM Cloud Object Storage Vault or Cold Vault, do I need to create another account? \n\nNo, storage classes (and regions as well) are defined at the bucket level. Simply create a new bucket that is set to the wanted storage class.\n\n\n\n\n\n When I create a bucket by using the API, how do I set the storage class? \n\nThe storage class (for example, us-smart) is assigned to the LocationConstraint configuration variable for that bucket. This is because of a key difference between the way AWS S3 and IBM Cloud Object Storage handle storage classes. Object Storage sets storage classes at the bucket level, while AWS S3 assigns a storage class to an individual object.

For example, if you have production data in 'standard', can we easily switch it to 'vault' for billing purposes if we are not using it frequently? \n\nYou can change the storage class by manually moving or copying the data from one bucket to another bucket with the wanted storage class.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can the location of a bucket be changed? \n\nTo change a location, create a new bucket in the desired location and move existing data to the new bucket.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does data consistency in Object Storage come with a performance impact?","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00579-7-1988","score":79.49488,"text":"\nIndexing and querying \n\nThe Index and querying document is the second best practice document in the series.

IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate. For more information, see the following websites:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant docs on [attachments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments)\n* Detaching IBM Cloudant attachments to [Object Storage](https:\/\/medium.com\/codait\/detaching-cloudant-attachments-to-object-storage-with-serverless-functions-99b8c3c77925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fewer databases are better than many \n\nIf you can, limit the number of databases per IBM Cloudant account to 500 or fewer. While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run. As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1325982-1327847","score":77.61877,"text":"\nYes, IBM COS SDKs are based on the official AWS S3 API SDKs, but are modified to use IBM Cloud features, such as IAM, Key Protect, Immutable Object Storage, and others.

What happens if I need more?\n\nYes, 100 is the current bucket limit. Generally, prefixes are a better way to group objects in a bucket, unless the data needs to be in a different region or storage class. For example, to group patient records, you would use one prefix per patient. If this is not a workable solution and you require additional buckets, contact IBM customer support.\n* If I want to store my data by using IBM Cloud Object Storage Vault or Cold Vault, do I need to create another account?\n\nNo, storage classes (and regions as well) are defined at the bucket level. Simply create a new bucket that is set to the wanted storage class.\n* When I create a bucket by using the API, how do I set the storage class?\n\nThe storage class (for example, us-smart) is assigned to the LocationConstraint configuration variable for that bucket. This is because of a key difference between the way AWS S3 and IBM Cloud Object Storage handle storage classes. Object Storage sets storage classes at the bucket level, while AWS S3 assigns a storage class to an individual object. For a list of valid provisioning codes for LocationConstraint, see [the Storage Classes guide](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-classes).\n* Can the storage class of a bucket be changed?

JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size.

Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00535-0-1738","score":116.03619,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Migration FAQ \n\nMigrate your plan to an IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Lite or Standard plan instance.\n\n\n\n  Which plans can I migrate? \n\nYou can migrate to a Lite or Standard plan from one of the following plans:\n\n\n\n*  IBM Cloudant Enterprise\n*  Apache CouchDB\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Migrating an Enterprise plan to a Lite or Standard plan](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-migrating-an-enterprise-plan-to-a-lite-or-standard-plan).\n\nOr you can migrate from the Lite plan to a Standard plan, which is just upgrading from the Lite plan to the Standard plan.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

For example, to define a condition that is true if the context variable $state contains the abbreviations for Massachusetts, Maine, or New Hampshire, you can use this expression:\n\n$state:MA || $state:ME || $state:NH\n* Checking for number values: When comparing numbers, first make sure the entity or variable you are checking has a value.

What alternatives exist? \n\nECMP isn\u2019t for redundant connections, but for balancing the load over the two links. With ECMP, both connections must terminate to the same IBM Cloud cross-connect router (XCR), which makes it a single point of failure. In other words, ECMP can be provisioned only as two sessions on the same IBM Cloud XCR.\n\nECMP is a feature of BGP. If you are looking for redundancy, you should get two Direct Link connections, one going into each XCR. If you want to use ECMP and have redundancy, you need two Direct Link connections on each XCR so that you can have 2 ECMP sessions running simultaneously.\n\nAlternatively, some customers set up two links into a different XCR in the same data center (for example, WDC02) and then failover as needed by using BGP configurations.

The human annotator annotates the documents in the annotation set. To later use inter-annotator scores to compare the annotations that are added by each human annotator, you must assign at least two human annotators to different annotation sets. You must also specify that some percentage of documents overlap between the sets.\n\nIn a realistic scenario, you create as many annotation sets as needed, based on the number of human annotators who are working in the workspace. In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

This is the color of the label that is applied to the entity after you annotate it.\n\n\n\nWhen annotating documents, human annotators can use the keyboard shortcuts to quickly add annotations. And the annotation label and text colors help human annotators to instantly recognize types after they add annotations to a document.\n\n\n\n* If there are entity or relation types that you do not want human annotators to assign to mentions, you can hide them from the ground truth editor, which shortens and simplifies the list of type options that users see. To do so, deselect the Active check box for the type.\n\n\n\nAs you assign new shortcuts and colors, you can preview the changes.\n5. You can also change the default selection highlight color. The highlight color is the color of the border that is displayed around text after human annotators select it. The default color is a light blue, but you can change the color on the Selection Highlight tab to make it easier to identify the boundaries of the text that is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n Related tasks \n\n[Modifying a type system without losing human annotations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-improve-mlwks_projtypesysmod)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting the IAA threshold \n\nTo help you decide whether to accept or reject an annotated document set, you can specify an inter-annotator agreement threshold.

To obtain ground truth, you will want to spend time training and educating human annotators so that they can make the best judgments when analyzing domain content.\n\n\n\n Inter-annotator agreement \n\nAfter human annotators have annotated the documents, you must determine which documents to promote to ground truth.

Precision is determined by the number of correctly labeled annotations divided by the total number of annotations added by the machine learning model. A precision score of 1.0 for entity type A means that every mention that was labeled as entity type A does indeed belong to that classification. A low precision score helps you identify places where the machine learning model created incorrect annotations.

For example, if the annotation task is focused on labeling parts of speech, you might expect to see a high score because of how well-defined the parts of speech are.

These events are automatically forwarded to the Activity Tracker service in the same region where the Key Protect service is provisioned.\n\nTo find out more, check out [IBM Cloud\u00ae Activity Tracker events](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-at-events).\n* How can I check what data is encrypted by which root key?\n\nWhen you use a root key to protect at rest data with envelope encryption, the cloud services that use the key can create a registration between the key and the resource that it protects. Registrations are associations between keys and cloud resources that help you get a full view of which encryption keys protect what data on IBM Cloud.\n\nYou can [browse the registrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources) that are available for your keys and cloud resources by using the Key Protect APIs.\n* What happens when I delete a key?\n\nIn the event that a key is no longer needed or should be removed, Key Protect allows you to delete and ultimately purge keys, an action that shreds the key material and makes any of the data encrypted with it inaccessible.\n\nDeleting a key moves it into a Destroyed state, a \"soft\" deletion in which the key can still be seen and restored for 30 days. After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1202060-1204107","score":14.351763,"text":"\nEach Key Protect instance gets a randomly-generated \"instance key-encrypted-key\" (IKEK) which is wrapped by the HSM master key, producing a wrapped instance key (WIKEK).

RHEL 8 is the recommended operating system and will become the default in the coming months.\n\nRed Hat CoreOS (RHCOS)\n: RHCOS is a minimal operating system for running containerized workloads securely and at scale. It is based on RHEL and includes automated, remote upgrade features. For more information about the key benefits of RHCOS, see [Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.10\/architecture\/architecture-rhcos.html). RHCOS is supported for Satellite hosts on Red Hat OpenShift version 4.9 or later. Red Hat CoreOS hosts don't support all services. For more information, see [Supported Satellite-enabled IBM Cloud services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-managed-services). To attach RHCOS hosts, your location must be [enabled for RHCOS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-locationsverify-coreos-location).\n\n\n\n Deciding whether to enable Red Hat CoreOS support for your location \n\nWhen you create a location, you can select whether to enable Red Hat CoreOS support. Enabling Red Hat CoreOS support comes with both pros and cons. A Red Hat CoreOS enabled location unlocks more features such as minimal outbound network requirements, bring your own key (BYOK) or keep your own key (KYOK) support for encrypting cluster secrets, HTTP proxy for outbound traffic, OpenShift virtualization, and single node cluster topology. But it has a higher infrastructure requirement. On the other hand, a non Red Hat CoreOS enabled location supports a smaller feature set but can run at a smaller footprint, allowing more clusters per same capacity.

The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03126-3707-6008","score":65.813194,"text":"\nUnderstanding where you will deploy the assistant before you begin can help you author the right types of answers for a given channel or platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n What languages does your assistant speak? \n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support.

However, when you provision an instance by restoring a boot volume from a bootable backup snapshot, you can expect degraded performance in the beginning. During the restoration process, the data is copied from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC, and thus the provisioned IOPS cannot be fully realized until that process finishes.\n\nYou can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region, and later use that snapshot to restore a volume in the new region.

If the response contains multiple media types or attachments, the generic response is converted into a series of separate message payloads as needed.

By using channels, you can define a single dialog node that supports all integrations, while still customizing the output for each channel. For example, you might want to customize the text formatting, or even send different response types, based on what the channel supports.\n\nUsing channels is particularly useful in conjunction with the channel_transfer response type. Because the message output is processed both by the channel initiating the transfer and by the target channel, you can use channels to define responses that will only be displayed by one or the other.

It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs that are deployed in environments such as messaging channels where customers start the conversation do not process nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation.

Under this pattern, each service SHOULD have a corresponding module that contains its API operations.

This is a simplified client app that uses standard input and output to handle three intents (sending a greeting, showing the current time, and exiting from the app):\n\nWelcome to the Watson Assistant example!\n>> hello\nGood day to you.\n>> what time is it?\nThe current time is 12:40:42 PM.\n>> goodbye\nOK!

For more information, see [Building a client application](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-client).\n\n\n\n Receiving an option response \n\nThe option response can be used when you want to present the user with a finite list of choices, rather than interpreting natural language input. This can be used in any situation where you want to enable the user to quickly select from a set of unambiguous options.\n\nIn our simplified client app, we will use this capability to select from a list of the actions the assistant supports (greetings, displaying the time, and exiting). In addition to the three intents previously shown (hello, time, and goodbye), the example workspace supports a fourth intent: menu, which is matched when the use asks to see a list of available actions.\n\nWhen the workspace recognizes the menu intent, the dialog responds with an option response:\n\n{\n\"output\": {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02586-5749-7864","score":42.992397,"text":"\nResponses with a 304 status MUST NOT have a response body. \n 307 [Temporary Redirect](https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc7231section-6.4.7) This code MAY be returned to indicate that the request should be resubmitted to the URI provided in the Location header, which MUST be included when this code is returned, and that future requests should use the original URI.

This is a simplified client app that uses standard input and output to handle three intents (sending a greeting, showing the current time, and exiting from the app):\n\nWelcome to the Watson Assistant example!\n>> hello\nGood day to you.\n>> what time is it?\nThe current time is 12:40:42 PM.\n>> goodbye\nOK!

This can be used in any situation where you want to enable the user to quickly select from a set of unambiguous options.\n\nIn our simplified client app, we will use this capability to select from a list of the actions the assistant supports (greetings, displaying the time, and exiting). In addition to the three intents previously shown (hello, time, and goodbye), the example workspace supports a fourth intent: menu, which is matched when the use asks to see a list of available actions.\n\nWhen the workspace recognizes the menu intent, the dialog responds with an option response:\n\n{\n\"output\": {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02575-1438-3471","score":43.759926,"text":"\nThe POST URI used to create a resource SHOULD be the same as the GET URI for listing resources of the same kind.\n\n[4]For example, if GET \/users lists all users, and users can be created by a client, then POST \/users SHOULD create a user.\n\nThe response to a POST request which successfully and synchronously creates a resource MUST have the status code 201 Created and a Location header with the URI of the newly-created resource\n\n[5]and SHOULD include the created resource in the response body.

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-index"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03330-3253-5192","score":32.039043,"text":"\n* A conversational skill interprets the customer's message further, then directs the flow of the conversation.

However, recovering from potential disasters that affect an entire location requires planning and preparation.\n\nYou are responsible for understanding your configuration, customization, and usage of Watson Assistant. You are also responsible for being ready to re-create an instance of the service in a new location and to restore your data in any location. See [How do I ensure zero downtime?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtimezero-downtime) for more information.\n\n\n\n  High availability \n\nWatson Assistant supports high availability with no single point of failure. The service achieves high availability automatically and transparently by using the multi-zone region feature provided by IBM Cloud.\n\nIBM Cloud enables multiple zones that do not share a single point of failure within a single location. It also provides automatic load balancing across the zones within a region.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Disaster recovery \n\nDisaster recovery can become an issue if an IBM Cloud location experiences a significant failure that includes the potential loss of data. Because the multi-zone region feature is not available across locations, you must wait for IBM to bring a location back online if it becomes unavailable. If underlying data services are compromised by the failure, you must also wait for IBM to restore those data services.\n\nIf a catastrophic failure occurs, IBM might not be able to recover data from database backups. In this case, you need to restore your data to return your service instance to its most recent state. You can restore the data to the same or to a different location.\n\nYour disaster recovery plan includes knowing, preserving, and being prepared to restore all data that is maintained on IBM Cloud.

For more information, see [Disconnected usage by component](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-disconnected-usedisconnect-usage-component).\n\nAre there additional requirements for disconnected usage?\n: Your location should still maintain network connection.\n\nHow do I set how long my access token is valid for?\n: Edit the value of the accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds parameter to set the token validity in seconds. For more information, see [Setting the disconnected usage time](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-disconnected-usedisconnect-time).\n\nWhat happens when my token expires?\n: After your token expires, you will lose the ability to work with the Location. When you run a command, you will get error messages such as error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized). To recover, you must reconnect the Location and log in again to retrieve a new token. Do not reload nodes before the Location is reconnected. Reloading nodes while the Location is disconnected prevents the Location from recovering.\n\nDo I need to re-create the Location?\n: No, you don't need to re-create the Location. You can reconnect the existing Location and reauthenticate to continue working with your Location.\n\nHow do I reauthenticate?\n: Reconnect your Location first and then log in again with your credentials.\n\nDo I have to recover etcd backup?\n: No, you don't need to recover etcd backup.

See [Known limitations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/dns-svcs?topic=dns-svcs-known-limitations) for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n What do the different zone states mean? \n\nThe zone states definitions are as follows.\n\n\n\n* Pending: When a DNS zone is added to the instance it will be in Pending. In this state Resource Records can be added, deleted or updated. Since the zone does not have any permitted networks, the zone will not be served by the resolvers in any region.\n* Active: When a domain has one or more permitted networks added then the domain state changes to ACTIVE and the domain will be served by the resolver from all the regions.\n* Disabled: In this state the zone will not be served and all control path operations will be disabled except deleting the zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I use any name for the zone? \n\nIn general, yes, you can use any name for the zone.

It uses machine learning models that are custom-built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search integration with IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website.

For example, after I create an ordering service and open it I see the error: Unable to get system channel. If you associated an identity without administrative privilege on the ordering service node, you will not be able to view or manage ordering service details.\n\n Why it\u2019s happening \n\nThis problem can be caused by a [bug](https:\/\/bugs.chromium.org\/p\/chromium\/issues\/detail?id=1006243) introduced by the Chrome browser Version 77.0.3865.90 (Official Build) (64-bit) that causes actions from the browser to fail.\n\n How to fix it \n\nTo resolve this problem, open the console in a new browser tab in Chrome. Any identities that you saved in your console wallet will persist in the new browser tab. To avoid this problem you can upgrade your Chrome browser version. Ensure you have downloaded all of your wallet identities to your local machine before closing your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n When I hover over my node, the status is Status unavailable or Status unknown, what does this mean? \n\n What\u2019s happening \n\nA CA, peer, or ordering node has a gray status box, meaning the status of the node is not available. Ideally, when you hover over any node, the node status should be Running.\n\n Why it\u2019s happening \n\nThis problem can occur if the node is newly created and the deployment process has not completed. If the node is a CA and the status has been gray for more than a few minutes, then it is likely that the deployment process has failed. Peers and ordering nodes take longer to deploy, but this condition can also occur when the health checker that runs against the peer or ordering nodes cannot contact the node. The request for status can fail with a timeout error because the node did not respond within a specific time period, the node could be down, or network connectivity is down.\n\n How to fix it \n\nIf this is a new node, wait a few more minutes for the deployment to complete.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-troubleshooting"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01872-7-2226","score":51.30798,"text":"\nFAQs about migrating resources to a different data center \n\nFAQs about migrating resources between data centers might include questions about migration requirements, timing, gathering information about your current or new configuration.\n\n\n\n Why am I required to migrate my resources? \n\nTo continue bringing you the best service, hardware, and connectivity, data centers are continually evaluated to ensure that they meet networking, electrical, and other infrastructure standards.

Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13336-7-1965","score":53.138245,"text":"\nPricing FAQs \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nThe IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service is available at three pricing plans: Lite, Plus, and Premium.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price.

IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae integrates with IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management.\n\n\n\n What is the difference between IBM Cloudant legacy and IAM access controls? \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud IAM \n\n\n\n* Centrally managed access management across IBM Cloud.\n* Allows a user or service to access many different resources by using the same set of credentials (for example, same username and password or IAM API key).\n* IAM API keys can be granted access to account management functions, like creating new databases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloudant legacy \n\n\n\n* Unique to IBM Cloudant.\n* Access to each service instance requires its own set of credentials.\n* Uses HTTP basic authentication with credentials that aren't bound to an individual user or service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is the Use only IAM mode preferred? \n\nThe Use only IAM mode means that only IAM credentials are provided through service binding and credential generation. You gain the following advantages when you use IBM Cloud IAM:\n\n\n\n* Managing access to IBM Cloudant with the standard tooling of IBM Cloud.\n* Using credentials that you can easily revoke and rotate when you use IBM Cloud IAM.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the advantages and disadvantages between these modes, see [Advantages and disadvantages of the two access control mechanisms](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudantadvantages-and-disadvantages-of-the-two-access-control-mechanisms-ai).\n\n\n\n\n\n How can I create an instance by using the command line? \n\nWhen you create a new IBM Cloudant instance from the command line, you must include the ibmcloud tool by using the -p parameter. This parameter enables or disables legacy credentials for an account by passing the option in JSON format. The option is called legacyCredentials.\n\nTo create an instance as Use only IAM, run the following command:\n\nibmcloud resource service-instance-create \"Instance Name\" cloudantnosqldb Standard us-south -p '{\"legacyCredentials\": false}'","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-authenticating-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00589-8040-10059","score":31.053764,"text":"\niam_apikey_description\n: Description of IAM API key.\n\niam_apikey_name\n: ID of IAM API key.\n\niam_role_crn\n: The IAM role that the IAM API key has.\n\niam_serviceid_crn\n: The CRN of service ID.\n\npassword\n: The IBM Cloudant legacy credential password.\n\nport\n: IBM Cloudant service port.\n\nurl\n: IBM Cloudant service URL, including embedded IBM Cloudant legacy credentials.\n\nusername\n: The IBM Cloudant legacy credential username.\n\nNote the included username and password are always equivalent to IAM's Manager credentials.

The major advantages for using IBM Cloud IAM are shown in the following list:\n\n\n\n* Management of access to IBM Cloudant with the standard tools of IBM Cloud rather than a combination of IBM Cloud and IBM Cloudant-specific credential management.\n* Credentials can be easily revoked and rotated when you use IBM Cloud IAM.\n\n\n\nFurther description of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach follows.\n\nWhen you use IAM roles other than Manager, such as Reader, Writer, Monitor, or Checkpointer, you must use Use only IAM to avoid supplying users with legacy credentials that include greater access permissions.\n\n\n\n Advantages and disadvantages of the two access control mechanisms \n\nOverall, IBM Cloud IAM is the recommended authentication model. However, the primary disadvantages to the approach are if you have an existing application or are unable to use an IBM Cloudant-supported client library.\n\n\n\n Advantages of IAM mode \n\n\n\n* Manage access for many services by using one interface.\n* Revoke access to a user globally.\n* Account-level API keys that use service IDs.\n* Easy-to-rotate credentials.\n* Activity Tracker logs capture individual humans and services.\n* IAM federates with other identity systems, like enterprise LDAP repositories.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03618-1804-3397","score":28.847084,"text":"\nThe TPM device is integrated within the server system and provides a range of Intel TXT security-related functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does Intel TXT does for you \n\nIntel TXT is especially advantageous for large enterprises subject to compliance and audit regulations, such as healthcare, financial services, and government organizations.

Minimum, maximum and default retention period are defined by this policy and apply to all objects in the bucket.\n\nMinimum retention period is the minimum duration of time an object must be kept unmodified in the bucket.\n\nMaximum retention period is the maximum duration of time an object can be kept unmodified in the bucket.\n\nIf an object is stored in the bucket without specifying a custom retention period, the default retention period is used. The minimum retention period must be less than or equal to the default retention period, which in turn must be less than or equal to the maximum retention period.\n\nA maximum retention period of 1000 years can be specified for the objects.\n\nTo create a retention policy on a bucket, you need Manager role. See [Bucket permissions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage\/iam?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam-bucket-permissions) for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n Legal hold \n\nCertain objects might need to be prevented from modification after a retention period expires. An example is an incomplete legal review, where records might need to be accessible for an extended duration beyond the retention period originally set. A legal hold flag can then be applied at the object level. Legal holds can be applied to objects during initial uploads or after an object is written. Note: A maximum of 100 legal holds can be applied per object.\n\n\n\n\n\n Indefinite retention","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage\/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutable"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.383649139,"ndcg_cut_10":0.550809594}}

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04113-1734-4014","score":30.526468,"text":"\nIBM CIS usually accelerates API traffic by removing connection overhead. However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.3868528072,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3868528072}}

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04136-7-2226","score":46.147232,"text":"\nDealing with Distributed Denial of Service attacks \n\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the most common types of internet attacks that your website or host can encounter.\n\n\n\n What is a DDoS attack? \n\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

After trusted signers push an image to a registry namespace, users can pull the signed content so that they can verify the publisher and the integrity of the image. \n Automatic vulnerability scans When you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, you can leverage the built-in security scanning that is provided by [Vulnerability Advisor](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_registry_cli). Every image that is pushed to your registry namespace is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities against a database of known CentOS, Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu issues.

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

Depending on the IVR service provider, you might need to configure call transfer to use a SIP BYE request instead. Use the transfer_method attribute to specify how to transfer the call, using either refer or hangup. When transfer_method is set to hangup instead of refer, the behavior of the transfer action changes. Instead of sending a SIP REFER request, the phone integration plays back any associated text and then hangs up the call by sending a SIP BYE request.\n\nAfter the hangup, the phone integration passes the transfer destination that is specified in the url attribute to the call anchor in the BYE message. The header field that contains the transfer target is determined by the transfer_target_header attribute. If the transfer_target_header attribute isn't specified, the phone integration uses Transfer-Target.\n\n{\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"connect_to_agent\",\n\"transfer_info\": {\n\"target\": {\n\"service_desk\": {\n\"sip\": {\n\"uri\": \"sip:user\\@domain.com\",\n\"transfer_method\": \"hangup\",\n\"transfer_target_header\": \"Transfer-Target\"\n}\n}\n}\n},\n\"agent_available\": {\n\"message\": \"Please hold on while I connect you with a live agent.\"\n},\n\"agent_unavailable\": {\n\"message\": \"Sorry, I could not find an agent.\"\n},\n\"message_to_human_agent\": \"The caller needs help resetting their password\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Transferring upon failure \n\nTo configure transfer on failures, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings.

You can evolve your schemas over time to accommodate changing requirements. Create a new version of an existing schema, and the Schema Registry ensures that the new version is compatible with the existing version, meaning that producers and consumers that use the existing version are not broken by the new version.\n\nSchemas are compared to avoid creating duplicate schemas where the schemas differ only in a way that does not affect the semantics of the schema. In some cases, the ordering of the JSON properties within a schema can be crucial to how the schema is used for encoding and decoding data, but in other cases it might not be relevant.\n\nFor example, the name property of a record schema is not used as part of the encoding and decoding process so you can position it anywhere inside the record JSON object. All these variations are considered the same schema.\n\nThe fields property in the JSON of a record schema is a case where its ordering is important. The Avro specification requires that a record\u2019s fields are encoded and decoded in the order they appear in the schema that is used for the encode and decode operation.\n\nAs an example, consider the following three schemas.\n\n\n\n Schema 1 \n\n{\n\"type\": \"record\",\n\"name\": \"book\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-ES_schema_registry"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07289-7-2048","score":12.185065,"text":"\nFAQs for Direct Link \n\nYou can review answers to some frequently asked questions about IBM Cloud\u00ae Direct Link.\n\n\n\n How does the new Direct Link differ from Direct Link on Classic? \n\nThe Direct Link offering differs from Direct Link on Classic in that Direct Link is decoupled from classic IaaS, and exists only in the local cross-connect router (XCR).

See [Setting up access to your Classic Infrastructure from VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-setting-up-access-to-classic-infrastructure) for more information.\n\nFor more information about the differences between the new Direct Link offering and the classic version (Direct Link on Classic), see [How do I know which Direct Link solution to order?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-linkget-started-solution-to-order).\n\n\n\n\n\n Where can I find Direct Link pricing and what do I pay for? \n\nSee the following FAQs for details.\n\n\n\n Where do I find cost estimates for Direct Link offerings? \n\nYou can estimate the cost of a service using the cost estimator on the provisioning pages for Direct Link offerings. For example, log in to the [IBM Cloud Direct Link console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/interconnectivity\/direct-link) and click Order Direct Link. Then, choose to order Direct Link Connect or Direct Link Dedicated. As you complete the ordering form, cost estimates appear in the Summary side panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n In terms of cost, what do I pay for? \n\nThere are two pricing plans: metered and unmetered. Metered has a port fee and bill per GB egressed across the Direct Link.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/dl?topic=dl-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12326-3651-6018","score":12.148944,"text":"\nTo configure the specifics of your development, staging, and production environment, use [Terraform input variables](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-create-tf-configconfigure-variables) in your configuration files. Input variables are automatically loaded into IBM Cloud Schematics when you create your workspace. To customize your workspace, you enter the environment-specific values for your variables. This setup is useful if you have one team that manages the lifecycle of the microservice component and where the configuration of your environments does not differ drastically. \n One Git repo, use branches to distinguish between environments Create one Git repository for your microservice component, and use different Git branches to store the Terraform configuration files for each of your environments. With this setup, you have a clear distinction between your environments and more control over who can access and change a particular configuration. Make sure to set up how changes in one configuration file are populated across branches to avoid that you have different configurations in each environment. \n One Git repo, use directories to distinguish between environments For organizations that prefer short-lived branches, and where configurations differ drastically across environments, consider creating directories that represent the different configurations of your environments. With this setup, all your directories listen for changes that are committed to the master branch. Make sure to set up how changes in one configuration file are populated across directories to avoid having different configurations in each environment. \n Use one Git repo per environment Use one Git repository for each of your environments. With this setup, you have a 1:1 relationship between your workspace and Git repository and you can apply separate permissions for each of your Git repositories. Make sure that your team can manage multiple Git repositories and keep them in sync. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How can I reuse configuration files across environments and workspaces? \n\nTry to minimize the number of Terraform configuration files that you need to manage by creating standardized Terraform templates and by using variables to customize the template to your needs.\n\nNow, you can use Terraform modules from the Terraform module registry for IBM Cloud.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-workspaces-plan"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00020-4245-6252","score":19.313398,"text":"\n<br><br> * [Working with Spark SQL and an external metastore](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-external-metastore)<br><br><br> \n Running applications with resource overcommitment There is a quota associated with each Analytics Engine Serverless instance. When applications are submitted on an instance, they are allocated resources from the instance quota. If an application requests resources beyond the available quota, the application will either not start or will run with less than the requested resources, which might result in the application running slower than expected or, in some cases, in the application failing.

Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Secret types in Secrets Manager\n\n Type Programmatic name Kind Description \n\n [Arbitrary secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets) arbitrary Static Arbitrary pieces of sensitive data, including any type of structured or unstructured data, that you can use to access an application or resource. \n [IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials) iam_credentials* Dynamic A dynamically generated service ID and API key that can be used to access an IBM Cloud service that requires IAM authentication. \n [Key-value secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-key-value) kv Static Pieces of sensitive data that is structured in JSON format that you can use to access an application or resource.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12467-1716-3849","score":34.682384,"text":"\n* When you try to modify or delete a secret while it is locked, Secrets Manager denies the request with an HTTP 412 Precondition Failed response.

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

When the secret reaches its expiration date, it transitions to a Destroyed state. When the transition happens, the value that is associated with the secret is no longer recoverable. The transition to the Destroyed state can take up to a couple of minutes after the secret expires, or a lock that prevented expiration is removed.\n\nFor more information about how your information is protected, see [Securing your data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-mng-data).\n\n\n\n\n\n What are differences between the Reader and SecretsReader roles? \n\nBoth the Reader and SecretsReader roles help you to assign read-only access to Secrets Manager resources.\n\n\n\n* As a reader, you can browse a high-level view of secrets in your instance.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

Dedicated hosts offer virtual server provisioning capacity and maximum placement control.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the benefits of using dedicated hosts over dedicated instances? \n\nBoth offerings are guaranteed single tenancy. Dedicated hosts provide the flexibility to specify on which host to provision dedicated host instances, and these other benefits:\n\n\n\n* Control over which IBM Cloud data center the server is placed\n* Ability to manage your servers as workload requirements change; for example, migrate virtual servers between your dedicated hosts on the same POD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I keep my existing dedicated instances or do I need to set up a dedicated host and dedicated host instances? \n\nYes, you can keep your existing dedicated instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I interchange provisioning of dedicated instances (auto\u2013assigned) and dedicated host instances? \n\nNo. Existing auto-assigned dedicated instances cannot be reprovisioned on dedicated hosts. If you require virtual server placement, you need to provision them on dedicated hosts as dedicated host instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n What type of server, virtual or bare metal, supports the dedicated host offering? \n\nThe offering is supported on virtual servers; IBM Cloud does have a bare metal offering. The differences between virtual hosts and bare metal servers are the time to provision and virtualization management.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the provisioning lifecycle of a dedicated host? \n\nDedicated hosts are allocated to users when provisioned. They persist to the account until it is reclaimed. Dedicated hosts are offered in only on-demand pricing, hourly or monthly, so when reclaimed, billing models charge as either hourly or monthly IBM Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is the dedicated host offering billed? \n\nYou can purchase dedicated hosts on-demand with hourly or monthly billing. Hourly only hosts allow only hourly instances to be provisioned; monthly only hosts allow provisioning of monthly and hourly instances. Pricing for dedicated hosts includes core, RAM, local SSD storage, and network port speeds. Premium operating systems, storage area network (SAN) storage, and software add-on prices and licensing are charged based on the instance deployed\u2014hourly or monthly\u2014on the dedicated host.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03729-1672-3956","score":64.46172,"text":"\nServices For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume.

Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-3313-5682","score":60.494446,"text":"\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Each resource might entail its own charges that can be [fixed, metered, tiered, or reserved](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-chargescharges) and billed by various incremental rates such as monthly or hourly.\n\nMonthly resources are billed based on the first of the month for usage in the preceding month. If you order a monthly resource in the middle of the month, you are charged a prorated amount for that month. However, if you cancel a resource in the middle of the month, you are still charged the full amount for the monthly resource.\n\n\n\n Worker nodes \n\nClusters can have two main types of worker nodes: virtual or physical (bare metal) machines.

Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources.\n\nWith Subscription accounts, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For more information about the differences between account types, see [Account types](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota? \n\nWhen you reach any quota for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended. Quotas are based per org and not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org show any usage from previous instances. The quota resets on the first of every month.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I use PayPal as a payment method? \n\nAs of March 31, 2023, PayPal is no longer accepted.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I update my credit card? \n\nUpdating your credit card is just like adding a new one. Go to the [Payments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/payments) page in the IBM Cloud console. In the Add Payment Method section, enter the billing information for your new card, and click Add credit card.\n\nTo switch to a different payment method, select Pay with Other, and click Submit change request. A support case to change your payment method is then created for you.\n\nIf your payments are managed outside of the console, go to IBM.com and log in to the Manage Payment Method application to update your credit card.
