These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00512-1696-3972","score":15.359576,"text":"\nDocuments with similar document IDs are unlikely to be placed onto the same shard.\n\nA non-partitioned database offers only global querying, described in more detail later.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases \n\nA partitioned database is the newest type of IBM Cloudant database. Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00513-7-2197","score":14.605831,"text":"\nDatabase overview \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae databases contain JSON objects.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned. The default for partitioned is false, maintaining compatibility with an earlier version.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00626-3414-5513","score":14.3796835,"text":"\nThe _replicator database is a special database within your account, where you can PUT or POST replication documents to specify the replications you want.\n\nBefore you start a replication, you must create the _replicator database.

It contains data that is sorted by the fields you specify, for example, books that are sorted by date and title. If you perform a query that asks for data that matches a document's date and title, the indexed data structure can be used to speed up the query process. Instead of scanning through every document in turn, IBM Cloudant can jump to the relevant part of the index (say, the section on 20th century books) and retrieve the data much more quickly.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query indexes include two types of indexes: type=json and type=text. These indexes are backed by two underlying indexing technologies that we meet in subsequent parts of this course.\n\nAn index is defined when you POST some JSON to a database's _index endpoint.\n\nThe index object contains a fields array, which specifies which document attributes to index. Usually, the fields that need indexing are equivalent to the attributes used in the selector of a query you're going to use to retrieve the data. That is, if you need to query by the date field, we need to index the date field.\n\nAlthough the name of an index is optional, it's good practice and we follow this convention. It's good to ask IBM Cloudant a question and specify the name of the index you intend it to use. This practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard. Select the database, then choose the Design Documents tab and Query Indexes from the menu.\n\nAny existing indexes are listed on the side: A special index must exist that represents the primary index, based on the document's _id.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00579-1483-3406","score":21.401995,"text":"\nSince the index does not store the document, you can access any field without thinking ahead about what to store in the index.\n* The disadvantage is that getting the document back is more costly than the alternative of emitting data into the index itself. First, the database has to look up the requested key in the index and then read the associated document. Also, if you\u2019re reading the whole document, but need only a single field, you\u2019re making the database read and transmit data that you don\u2019t need.\n\n\n\nThis example also means that a potential race condition exists here. The document might change, or be deleted, between the index and document read (although unlikely in practice).\n\nEmitting data into the index (a so-called \u201cprojection\u201d in relational algebra terms) means that you can fine-tune the exact subset of the document that you need. In other words, you don\u2019t need to emit the whole document. Emit a value that represents only the data you need in the app that is a cut-down object with minimal details, for example:\n\nemit(doc.indexed_field, {name: doc.name, dob: doc.dob});\n\nIf you change your mind on what fields you want to emit, the index needs rebuilding.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query\u2019s JSON indexes use views this way under the hood.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it.

The limiting algorithm that is used for the sustained rate and burstiness follows the Token Bucket model, where there is one fixed-capacity bucket that is applied for all the purge paths in your account. The total number of tokens in the bucket represents the number of paths that can be purged in a burst.\n\nIn the following table, X-RateLimit-Purge-Paths-Limit-Burst represents the number of tokens that the bucket can hold. The initial token bucket is full. Tokens are constantly added to this bucket based on the sustained rate (X-RateLimit-Purge-Paths-Limit-Per-Second). However, if the bucket is full, no more tokens can be added.\n\nWhen a multiple file purge request is made, the remaining number of tokens is checked against the number of file paths.

If the block size is smaller than the block size used by the profile to calculate the share\u2019s bandwidth limit, the IOPS limit is reached before the throughput limit. Conversely, if the block size is larger, the throughput limit is reached before the IOPS limit.\n\nTable 5 provides some examples of how block size and IOPS affect the throughput, calculated average I\/O block size x IOPS = Throughput in MBps.\n\n\n\nTable 5.

Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00625-3455-5153","score":18.470634,"text":"\n\"productid\": \"1000042\",\n\"taxonomy\": [\n\"Home\",\n\"Kitchen\",\n\"Small Appliances\"\n],\n\"type\": \"product\"\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n Query parameters \n\nYou can add some query parameters to the URL, for example \/mydatabase\/doc?attachments=true&conflicts=true.\n\nAll parameters are optional.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For example, you can add a condition, like !($size && $time), that prevents the response from being displayed if the $size and $time context variables are both provided.\n- Add the !all_slots_filled condition to the response. This setting prevents the response from being displayed if all of the slots are filled. Do not use this approach if you are including a confirmation slot. The confirmation slot is also a slot, and you typically want to prevent the Found responses from being displayed before the confirmation slot itself is filled.\n\n Handling requests to exit a process {: dialog-slots-node-level-handler}\n\nAdd at least one slot handler that can recognize it when a user wants to exit the node.\n\nFor example, in a node that collects information to schedule a pet grooming appointment, you can add a handler that conditions on the cancel intent, which recognizes utterances such as, <q>Forget it.

These locations are called availability zones. An availability zone is an IBM Cloud\u00ae Public location that hosts your data. All Lite and Standard plans automatically deploy into a multi-zone region.

The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16299-1512-2608","score":26.542955,"text":"\n* [Web chat development overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop): You can use the web chat API to extensively customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat.\n* Customizing the phone integration: You can use commands and context variables to extensively configure how your assistant interacts with users using the phone integration.

You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat. This can be either a generated unique identifier (for anonymous users) or an authenticated user ID.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16388-7-1918","score":23.15068,"text":"\nEncrypting sensitive data \n\nBy using the public key that is provided by IBM, you can add another level of encryption to hide sensitive data you send from the web chat.\n\nTo use this method for encrypting data, you must first enable the web chat security feature. For more information, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).\n\nUse this method to send sensitive information in messages that come from your website, such as information about a customer's loyalty level, a user ID, or security tokens to use in webhooks that you call from actions. Information passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private context variable. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for a standard customer. You do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such, but you must pass this information to your action so it can change the flow of the conversation. To do this, you can pass the customer MVP status as an encrypted variable.

This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

Your identity provider can conform to any authentication mechanism alternate to those supported by IBM Cloud\u00ae App ID, including proprietary or legacy.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nBy bringing your own identity provider, you can create a custom authentication flow that uses your own protocols. You have more control, such as information that you want to share or information that is stored.\n\nBe sure to [configure your custom provider](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-custom-identity) before you add it to your application.\n\n\n\n When would I want to use this flow? \n\nWhen App ID does not provide direct support for a particular identity provider, you can use the custom identity flow to bridge the authentication protocol to App ID's existing authentication flow. For example, you want to use GitHub or LinkedIn to allow your users to sign in. You can use the identity provider's existing SDK to facilitate user authentication information before packaging and exchanging it with App ID.\n\nThere are many scenarios where a different authentication flow is necessary:\n\n\n\n* Proprietary, in-house identity providers\n* Third-party identity providers\n* Complicated authentication flows, which can include proprietary multi-factor mechanisms\n\n\n\nOccasionally, a legacy provider might use their own custom authentication protocol. Because the custom identity flow completely decouples authentication from authorization, you can adopt any authentication mechanism of your choice and then provide the resulting authentication information to App ID. All without exposing user credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n Technically, how does this flow work? \n\nThe custom identity workflow is built on the JWT-Bearer extension grant type that is defined in Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grants [[RFC7521]](https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc7523section-2.1). To exchange user information for App ID tokens, your authentication architecture creates a trust relationship with App ID by using an asymmetric RSA key pair. Once trust is established, you can use the JWT-Bearer grant type to exchange verified user information within a signed JWT for App ID tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the flow look like?","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-custom-auth"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02766-7-2005","score":11.8168335,"text":"\nManaging authentication \n\nIdentity providers (IdP's) add a level of security for your mobile and web apps, through authentication. With IBM Cloud\u00ae App ID, you can configure one or several identity providers to create a custom sign-in experience for your users.\n\nApp ID interacts with identity providers by using various protocols such as OpenID Connect, SAML, and more. For example, OpenID Connect is the protocol that is used with many social providers such as Facebook, Google. Enterprise providers such as [Azure Active Directory](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-azure-active-directory) or [Active Directory Federation Service](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-active-directory-federation-service), generally use SAML as their identity protocol. For [Cloud Directory](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), the service uses SCIM to verify identity information.\n\nWhen you use social or enterprise identity providers, App ID reads user account information. Because the service never has write access to the information, users must go through their chosen identity provider to do actions, such as resetting their password. For example, if a user signs in to your app with Facebook, and then wanted to change their password, they must go to www.facebook.com to do so.\n\nWhen you use [Cloud Directory](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), App ID is the identity provider. The service uses your registry to verify your users identity.

Check out [Application identity](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-app).\n\nSeveral identity providers can be configured to be used by App ID.

If the user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to still access their anonymous attributes by attaching their anonymous profile to their user identity with App ID.\n\n\n\n Understanding progressive authentication \n\nWhen a user chooses not to sign in immediately, they are considered an anonymous user. For example, say you're an online retailer and you want to allow users to add objects to their shopping cart without signing in. However, you ask them to sign in to complete their purchase. If a user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to access the same objects that were in their shopping carts before they signed in.\n\nYou can use App ID to gather information about anonymous users into an anonymous user profile, which you can use to help personalize their experience of your application. If the user chooses to signs in, you can attach the user attributes that are part of the anonymous profile to their user identity that is stored in App ID. Anonymous profiles are temporarily valid. While you develop your app, you can [configure the lifetime](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-managing-idpidp-token-lifetime) of anonymous tokens.\n\nWhen a user signs in, they become an identified user. If an existing identified user profile does not exist, you can create a new identified user profile. After a user is identified, App ID issues new access and identity tokens and their anonymous token becomes invalid. However, an identified user can still access the attributes of their anonymous profile because they are accessible with the new access and identity tokens.\n\nYou can attach the attributes of only one anonymous profile to the user's identity that is stored in App ID. For example, say that a user browses your application anonymously in two separate browser tabs. The user adds a t-shirt to the shopping cart on the first tab and a pair of shorts to the cart on the second tab. App ID creates two separate anonymous profiles to track the interactions of the user with your application on each tab.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-anonymous"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02777-1581-3292","score":11.019477,"text":"\nThe endpoint that you choose to call can vary depending on your use case.\n\nNot sure which one works best?

You can define patterns with special significance to your application. For example, the bill of materials (BOM) numbers for parts that you manufacture might have a standard syntax of two uppercase letters followed by four numbers (GT2345). You can teach Discovery to recognize BOM mentions by adding a regular expression that can recognize and tag occurrences of the pattern in text.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-glossary"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09275-12363-14275","score":10.95913,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Best practices for organizing resources and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-account_setup).\n\nWhen you define your resource groups, do not add sensitive information in the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n Naming \n\nIf you add PII or other sensitive information in the name or the description of a service instance, you might be disclosing sensitive data to others in the same account.\n\nWhen you define your logging instances names, do not add sensitive information in the name or in the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n Service plan \n\nThe service plan that you choose for a logging instance determines the number of days that data is available for search.

For example, if an organization tries to create a channel when it is not a member of the orderer's consortium, the request will be denied. Orderers also validate against behaviors in transaction channels, such as the permissions for changing a channel configuration.\n\n\n\nHyperledger Fabric currently uses an implementation of the Raft protocol for its ordering service.

The expectation is that web-based services that interact with database systems behave in this way. But that expectation doesn't mean that they do work this way. Consistency isn't a given, and it takes a little work to change the approach.\n\nIn fact, consistency isn't necessarily essential for many enterprise cloud services. Large, heavily used systems bring with them a high probability that a portion of the system might fail. A database that is engineered around the need to prioritize availability and eventual consistency is better suited to keeping your application online. The consistency of application data can be addressed after the fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n Application availability versus consistency in the enterprise \n\nA look at popular web-based services shows that people already expect high availability, and happily trade this availability for eventually consistent data, often without realizing they're doing so.\n\nMany applications mislead users for the sake of availability. Consider ATMs: inconsistent banking data is why it's still possible to overdraft money without realizing it. It's unrealistic to present a consistent view of your account balance throughout the entire banking system if every node in the network must halt and record this figure before operations continue. A better choice is to make the system highly available.\n\nThe banking industry figured it out back in the 1980s, but many IT organizations are still worried about sacrificing consistency for the sake of availability. Think about the number of support calls placed when your sales team can't access their CRM app. Now consider whether they would even notice when it takes a few seconds for a database update to propagate throughout the application.\n\nAvailability trumps consistency more than you might expect. Online shopping cart systems, HTTP caches, and DNS are a few more examples. Organizations must consider the cost of downtime such as user frustration, productivity loss, and missed opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n From theory to implementation \n\nAddressing high availability is vital for cloud applications.

If there are existing objects in a bucket that should be replicated, the replication processes needs to be made aware of the existence of the objects. This can be easily accomplished by using the PUT copy operation to copy objects onto themselves.\n\nThis process will reset some object metadata, including creation timestamps. This will impact lifecycle policies and any other services that use creation or modification timestamps (such as content delivery networks). Ensure that any disruptions that may arise from resetting object metadata are dealt with appropriately.\n\nThe process involves:\n\n\n\n1. Creating a list of all the objects in a bucket that should be subject to replication rules,\n2. Iterating over that list, performing a PUT copy operation on each object with the source being identical to the target of the request.\n\n\n\nThis example will only replicate the new version of the object created by the PUT copy request.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

Unlike Discovery Query Language queries, with natural language queries you cannot specify which fields from the document you care about or how much significance to give to each one.

With enough examples, Discovery can return better answers because it knows where the best answers are typically stored.\n\nRelevancy training cannot be used to give more weight to nested fields.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00616-3461-5143","score":16.160065,"text":"\n2.

A replication copies all the changes that happened in the source database to the target database. When a document is deleted from the source database, the document is also deleted from the target database.\n\nFor more information, see [Replication](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-apireplication-operation).\n\n\n\n1.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Learn to use the conversation flow to your advantage and alter the flow if necessary.\n\n\n\n Digressions \n\nA digression occurs when a user is in the middle of a dialog flow that is designed to address one goal, and abruptly switches topics to initiate a dialog flow that is designed to address a different goal. The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.\n\nWith digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they were in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

For example, to define a condition that is true if the context variable $state contains the abbreviations for Massachusetts, Maine, or New Hampshire, you can use this expression:\n\n$state:MA || $state:ME || $state:NH\n* Checking for number values: When comparing numbers, first make sure the entity or variable you are checking has a value.

What alternatives exist? \n\nECMP isn\u2019t for redundant connections, but for balancing the load over the two links. With ECMP, both connections must terminate to the same IBM Cloud cross-connect router (XCR), which makes it a single point of failure. In other words, ECMP can be provisioned only as two sessions on the same IBM Cloud XCR.\n\nECMP is a feature of BGP. If you are looking for redundancy, you should get two Direct Link connections, one going into each XCR. If you want to use ECMP and have redundancy, you need two Direct Link connections on each XCR so that you can have 2 ECMP sessions running simultaneously.\n\nAlternatively, some customers set up two links into a different XCR in the same data center (for example, WDC02) and then failover as needed by using BGP configurations.

A pre-annotator is a Knowledge Studio dictionary, rule-based model, or machine learning model that you can run to find and annotate mentions automatically.\n\nPre-annotation makes the job of human annotators easier because it covers the straightforward annotations, and gets the job of annotating the documents underway.\n\nThe method that you use to pre-annotate documents in no way restricts the ways that you can use the resulting model. For example, just because you use the Natural Language Understanding service to pre-annotate documents does not mean you must deploy the final machine learning model that you build to the Natural Language Understanding service.\n\n\n\n Pre-annotation methods \n\nThe following pre-annotators are available:\n\n\n\n* Natural Language Understanding\n\nA pre-annotator that you can use to find mentions of entities in your documents automatically. If your source documents have general knowledge subject matter, then this pre-annotator is a good choice for you. If you are working with highly specialized documents that focus on a specific field, such as patent law research, for example, the dictionary pre-annotator or rule-based model might be a better choice.\n* Dictionary\n\nUses a dictionary of terms that you provide and associate with an entity type to find mentions of that entity type in the documents. This choice is best for fields with unique or specialized terminology because this pre-annotator does not analyze the context in which the term is used in the way a machine learning pre-annotator does; it instead relies on the term being distinct enough to have a decipherable meaning regardless of the context in which it is used. For example, it is easier to recognize asbestos as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of squash, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.\n\nDictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-preannotation"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16463-1457-3136","score":18.43377,"text":"\nThen, you can assign the documents to human annotators to finish the annotation work.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lesson 1: Pre-annotating new documents with a machine learning model \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to use a machine learning model to pre-annotate documents in Knowledge Studio.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nAfter you train a machine learning model, you can use it to pre-annotate new documents that you add to the corpus.\n\n> Attention: Do not run a pre-annotator on documents that have been annotated by humans, but not been added to the ground truth yet.

Fires on that scale are unusual, but not unique. As a business, should you spend time and money making sure that your computer systems could survive such a fire? The answer depends on various factors, but if for instance, your entire customer base is in Chicago, worrying about events that will wipe out the whole city is likely not useful. So it is worth thinking about what sorts of things might fail, how likely they are to happen, and how damaging they would be, before deciding what level of redundancy is appropriate.\n\n\n\n Geographic redundancy \n\nLevels of redundancy have both a technical and a geographic component. If you have two houses, are you more likely to become homeless if the houses are next door to each other or if they are in different countries? Similar considerations drive computer system redundancy, and are behind IBM\u00ae\u2019s use of local, regional, and global redundancy. Local redundancy duplicates some or all of a computer system in the same data center. This protects against many kinds of outages, but not all. Regional redundancy, as implemented by IBM, provides at least three copies of the system in three different data centers, so a single local event, like a large fire, is unlikely to take down all the systems. Global redundancy is available for customers that want to avoid outages that are caused by large regional events such as severe hurricanes and typhoons.\n\nZoom\n\n![Geographic levels of redundancy.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/adcecdbe4e86955f88aac7f3c1e7ec3ff44992ef\/overview\/images\/geographic-redundancy.svg)\n\nFigure 2.

So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures. However, usually the combination of different services and data bridges requires high performance and flexible pipelines. Spanning from IoT devices up to cloud storage, and an analytics platform. Often pre-configured bridges lack the programmability to implement and fine-tune a particular solution architecture. Given the variety of pipelines, and the lack of standardization around data fusion in general (IoT in particular), it is common to see environments where the pipeline requires custom data transformation. These custom data transformations apply to format conversion, filtering, or augmentation. Cloud Functions is an excellent tool to implement such a transformation, in a serverless manner, where the custom logic is hosted on a fully managed and elastic cloud platform.\n\nLook at the following sample IoT application that uses Cloud Functions, Node-RED, Cognitive, and other services: [Serverless transformation of IoT data-in-motion with Cloud Functions](https:\/\/medium.com\/openwhisk\/serverless-transformation-of-iot-data-in-motion-with-openwhisk-272e36117d6c).\n\n\n\n\n\n API backend \n\nServerless computing platforms give developers a rapid way to build APIs without servers.

Each collection adds documents from a single data source. When they are built together into a single project, a user can search across both sources at the same time.\n* Applying enrichments\n\nCreating a collection is a good way to group documents that you want to enrich in a similar way. For example, maybe a subset of your documents contains industry jargon and you want to add a dictionary that recognizes the terms. You can create a separate collection and apply the Parts of Speech enrichment so you can use the term suggestions feature to speed up the process of creating the dictionary.\n* Creating separate Smart Document Understanding (SDU) models\n\nYou can use the Smart Document Understanding tool to identify content based on the structure of a document. If you have 20 PDF files that were created by your Sales department and use one template and 20 PDF files that were created by your Research department and use a different template, group each set into its own collection. You can then use the SDU tool to build a model for each structure separately, a model that understands the unique structure.

Dedicated hosts offer virtual server provisioning capacity and maximum placement control.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the benefits of using dedicated hosts over dedicated instances? \n\nBoth offerings are guaranteed single tenancy. Dedicated hosts provide the flexibility to specify on which host to provision dedicated host instances, and these other benefits:\n\n\n\n* Control over which IBM Cloud data center the server is placed\n* Ability to manage your servers as workload requirements change; for example, migrate virtual servers between your dedicated hosts on the same POD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I keep my existing dedicated instances or do I need to set up a dedicated host and dedicated host instances? \n\nYes, you can keep your existing dedicated instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I interchange provisioning of dedicated instances (auto\u2013assigned) and dedicated host instances? \n\nNo. Existing auto-assigned dedicated instances cannot be reprovisioned on dedicated hosts. If you require virtual server placement, you need to provision them on dedicated hosts as dedicated host instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n What type of server, virtual or bare metal, supports the dedicated host offering? \n\nThe offering is supported on virtual servers; IBM Cloud does have a bare metal offering. The differences between virtual hosts and bare metal servers are the time to provision and virtualization management.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the provisioning lifecycle of a dedicated host? \n\nDedicated hosts are allocated to users when provisioned. They persist to the account until it is reclaimed. Dedicated hosts are offered in only on-demand pricing, hourly or monthly, so when reclaimed, billing models charge as either hourly or monthly IBM Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is the dedicated host offering billed? \n\nYou can purchase dedicated hosts on-demand with hourly or monthly billing. Hourly only hosts allow only hourly instances to be provisioned; monthly only hosts allow provisioning of monthly and hourly instances. Pricing for dedicated hosts includes core, RAM, local SSD storage, and network port speeds. Premium operating systems, storage area network (SAN) storage, and software add-on prices and licensing are charged based on the instance deployed\u2014hourly or monthly\u2014on the dedicated host.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.11\/nodes\/pods\/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload. Priority classes can help you control the Red Hat OpenShift controller decisions to favor higher priority pods over lower priority pods. The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs). Access policies and SCCs can help prevent untrusted users from deploying high priority pods that prevent other pods from scheduling.\n\nHow does priority scheduling and preemption work?\n\nIn general, pending pods that have a higher priority are scheduled before lower prioritized pods. If you don't have enough resources remaining in your worker nodes, the Red Hat OpenShift controller can preempt (remove) pods to free up enough resources for the higher prioritized pods to be scheduled. Preemption is also affected by graceful termination periods, pod disruption budgets, and worker node affinity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-pod_priority"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10089-4336-5836","score":12.207587,"text":"\n(https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/autoscaler\/blob\/master\/cluster-autoscaler\/FAQ.mdhow-does-scale-up-work) and [How does scale-down work?](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/autoscaler\/blob\/master\/cluster-autoscaler\/FAQ.mdhow-does-scale-down-work).\n\nCan I change how scale-up and scale-down work?\n: You can customize settings or use other Kubernetes resources to affect how scaling up and down work.\n\nScale-up\n: [Customize the cluster autoscaler ConfigMap values](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-cluster-scaling-enablecluster-scaling-customize) such as scanInterval, expander, skipNodes, or maxNodeProvisionTime.

It is the brain of a Presto installation and is also the node to which a client connects to submit statements for execution. It is also responsible for fetching results from the workers and returning the results to the client.\n* Worker - A worker is a server type in a Presto installation, which is responsible for running tasks and processing data. Worker nodes fetch data from connectors and exchange intermediate data with each other.\n* Resource manager - The resource manager is a server type in presto, which aggregates data from all coordinator and workers and creates a global view of the Presto cluster.\n\n\n\nThe following connectors are supported in watsonx.data:\n\n\n\n* [Iceberg](https:\/\/prestodb.io\/docs\/current\/connector\/iceberg.html)\n* [Db2](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-db2_connector)\n* [Netezza](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-netezza_connector)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-presto_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06966-2415-4333","score":9.73733,"text":"\nThe crawler plug-in can apply more nuanced rules to what documents and what fields in the documents get added.

A production installation includes two crawler pods, which can process six collections simultaneously.\n\nIf you are running a starter installation and you want to process more than three collections simultaneously, you must increase the number of crawler pods by running the following commands:\n\noc patch wd wd --type=merge --patch='{\"spec\": {\"ingestion\": {\"crawler\": {\"replicas\": <number-of-replicas> } } } }'\n\nIn a starter installation, the maximum number of simultaneous collections that can crawl an external data source is 3. If you start a fourth, that collection does not start to process until the prior three crawls finish.\n\nEach number-of-replicas allows 3 simultaneous crawls, so number-of-replicas=2 increases the replicas to 6, and number-of -replicas=3 increases them to 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Crawler plug-in settings \n\nWhen you deploy one or more crawler plug-ins, you can configure your collection to use one of the plug-ins.\n\nThese settings are only available when crawler plug-ins are deployed.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collection-types"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11790-1250-2755","score":9.677728,"text":"\n[Plan your environment](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-infrastructure-plan) for Satellite by choosing your infrastructure, thinking about the services that you want to use, and setting up the hosts that you want to use.

This topic provides a high-level overview of the platform components that your service uses, and pulls these concepts together into an end-to-end provisioning scenario.\n\n\n\n The IBM Cloud provisioning layer \n\nThe provisioning layer manages the lifecycle of IBM Cloud resources. The provisioning layer is responsible for controlling and tracking the lifecycle of resources in a customer account. Resources are physical or logical components that can be created or reserved for an application or service instance. Examples of resources include database, accounts, processor, memory, and storage limits. In general, resources that are tracked by the provisioning layer are intended to associate usage metrics and billing, but that isn\u2019t always the case. In some cases, the resource might be associated to the provisioning layer to ensure that the resource lifecycle can be managed along with the account lifecycle.\n\n\n\n Resource lifecycle management \n\nThe provisioning layer provides common APIs to control the lifecycle of resources from creation (creating an instance) to binding (creating access credentials) to unbinding (removing access) to deletion (deleting an instance). Additionally, the IBM Cloud platform provides CLIs and a UI that can manage the lifecycle of these resources that don\u2019t require you to create your own facilities.\n\nThe provisioning layer provides APIs to help you manage the following elements of your resource lifecycle:\n\n\n\n* Creating a resource instance\n* Updating a resource instance\n* Binding\n* Resource keys\n* Unbinding\n* Deleting a resource instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nIdentity Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely authenticate users and control access to all cloud resources consistently across IBM Cloud.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories.

However, Virtual Router Appliance does not provide next-generation firewall add-ons and purpose-built security processors.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Can FSA 10G and a network gateway be associated with the same VLAN? \n\nNo, it is not possible to have an FSA 10G and a network gateway device to be associated with the same customer VLAN.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Does this offering charge for private network connectivity? \n\nIBM offers private connectivity free of charge, which is one of the key differentiators in the marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Is FSA 1 Gbps also a multi-VLAN offering? \n\nNo, only FSA 10 Gbps supports multiple VLANs.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Is FSA 10 Gbps available in Federal data centers? \n\nFSA 10 Gbps is not currently available in Federal data centers.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Can an FSA 10 Gbps be used in place of a Virtual Router Appliance? \n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Do you plan to upgrade FSA 1G with the same capability of the FSA 10G appliance? \n\nNot currently.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Can the FSA 10 Gbps span over multiple pods in a data center? \n\nNot currently. FSA 10 Gbps is only able to protect VLANs for the pod it is deployed in.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What are the default DNS servers of FortiGate 10 Gbps? \n\nBy default, FortiGate uses the following FortiGuard's DNS servers.\n\n\n\n*  Primary: 208.91.112.53\n*  Secondary: 208.91.112.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/fortigate-10g?topic=fortigate-10g-faqs-for-fortigate-security-appliance-10gbps"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06027-1539-3662","score":9.346355,"text":"\nFor more information about pod security profiles, see [Profile details](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/security\/pod-security-standards\/) in the Kubernetes documentation.\n\nPod Security Admission contains three modes that define what action the control plane takes if a potential violation is detected.\n\nenforce\n: Policy violations cause the pod to be rejected.\n\naudit\n: Policy violations trigger the addition of an audit annotation to the event recorded in the audit log, but are otherwise allowed.\n\nwarn\n: Policy violations trigger a user-facing warning, but are otherwise allowed.\n\nAs security standards or profiles implementations change to address new features, you can configure Pod Security Admission to use a specific version of the roles.

To upgrade a VPN connection that was created using a custom IKE or IPsec policy that contains weak ciphers, complete the following steps.\n\nYou will experience a network outage during the upgrade. The duration of the outage depends on the time that it takes to update the weak ciphers and to reestablish the VPN connection. It is recommended that you plan a maintenance window for this upgrade.\n\nBefore you begin, it is a good idea to first configure your on-prem VPN gateway peer to contain both the weak and secure ciphers for Phase 1 and Phase 2 negotiation. Then, change the IBM VPN gateway to remove the use of the weak ciphers by following these steps. Afterward, remove the weak ciphers from the on-prem VPN gateway. This step might also reduce the outage time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Upgrading a VPN from a custom IKE policy in the UI \n\nTo upgrade the IKE policy by using the UI, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

While you develop your skill, you use the Try it out pane to verify that your assistant recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and to make corrections as needed.\n\nFrom the User conversations page, you can analyze actual interactions between the assistant you used to deploy the skill and your users. Based on those interactions, you can make corrections to improve the accuracy with which intents and entities are recognized by your dialog skill. It is difficult to know exactly how your users will ask questions, or what random messages they might submit, so it is important to frequently analyze real conversations to improve your dialog skills.\n\nFor a Watson Assistant instance that includes multiple assistants, there might be times when it is useful to use message data from the dialog skill of one assistant to improve the dialog skill used by another assistant within that same instance.\n\nAs an example, say you have a Watson Assistant instance named HelpDesk. You might have both a Production assistant and a Development assistant in your HelpDesk instance. When working in the dialog skill for the Development assistant, you can use logs from the Production assistant messages to improve the Development assistant's dialog skill.\n\nAny edits you then make within the dialog skill for the Development assistant will only affect the Development assistant's dialog skill, even though you\u2019re using data from messages sent to the Production assistant.\n\nSimilarly, if you create multiple versions of a skill, you might want to use message data from one version to improve the training data of another version.\n\nYou cannot access log data from assistants that were created in other service instances.\n\n\n\n Picking a data source \n\nThe term data source refers to the logs compiled from conversations between customers and the assistant or custom application by which a dialog skill was deployed.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-logs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

However, real conversations almost never follow such a simple flow. In the middle of a conversation, customers might get distracted, ask questions about related issues, misunderstand something, or change their minds about what they want to do.\n\nThe Change conversation topic feature enables your assistant to handle these digressions, dynamically responding to the user by changing the conversation topic as needed.\n\n\n\n How changing the topic works \n\nThis example shows a customer who changes the conversation topic while they are entering a credit card. When the assistant asks What is your CVV number?, the customer (who is new to credit cards) asks what a CVV is. The assistant is designed to handle this possibility, so it switches to a different action that answers the customer's question. It then continues where it left off.\n\n![Example: changing the conversation topic](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718\/watson-assistant\/images\/changing-topic-example.gif)\n\nThe assistant determines when to change the conversation topic as follows:\n\n\n\n1.

(Changing the topic cannot switch the conversation to a different assistant.)\n\nIf the input does not answer the question, and it does not match any existing action of the assistant, a step validation error results.

The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously).

It is also important to know how you can delete any stored data.\n\n\n\n What information is stored in App Configuration? \n\nThe following information are stored when you use App Configuration service dashboard or API or CLI:\n\n\n\n* Instance details\n* Environments\n* Collections\n* Properties\n* Features\n* Segment rules\n\n\n\nThese information can be deleted using the APIs mentioned [here](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/app-configuration). Deletion of above information is deleted permanently from the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n How your data is stored and encrypted in App Configuration \n\nApp Configuration stores and encrypts definitions of environments, collections, features, properties and segment rules. This data is encrypted at rest. As a multi-tenant service, any data stored is encrypted with the default IBM provided key for all tenants.\n\nIBM personnel have access to the configuration data. It is recommended to avoid storing sensitive information as part of the configuration. If sensitive data storage is required, consider using [IBM Cloud Secrets Manager](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-getting-started).\n\nYou can add a higher level of encryption control to your data at rest (when it is stored) by enabling integration with a Key Management Service (KMS). The data that you store in IBM Cloud is encrypted at rest by using envelope encryption. If you need to control the encryption keys, you can integrate Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Services. This process is commonly referred to as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK). With Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services, you can create, import, and manage encryption keys. You can assign access policies to the keys, assign users or service IDs to the keys, or give the key access only to a specific service.\n\nFor more information, see [Managing encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-managing-encryption).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-securing-your-data"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12670-7-2415","score":12.142131,"text":"\nFAQs for Data Security Broker \n\nThis section provides answers to common questions about the Data Security Broker service.\n\nWhat is Data Security Broker Manager?\n\nData Security Broker Manager enables encryption policies and configurations by communicating with the Data Security Broker Shield and the desired databases. Data Security Broker Manager constructs a privacy schema that maps key IDs to data columns, thus enabling encryption in a simplified manner. Data Security Broker Shield carries out de-identification, masking, and encryption tasks for cloud databases.\n\nData Security Broker integrates with key management stores through a key virtualization layer. It also provides for a local key store, so you can use your own keys for data protection in the cloud.\n\nIs the instance hosted by Data Security Broker?\n\nData Security Broker software is hosted entirely in the customer's environment. Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield may be hosted on-premises or on cloud platforms such as IBM Cloud.\n\nWhat size instance is good for getting set up?\n\n30 gigabytes are sufficient for Data Security Broker Manager because it controls the Shields and the memory needed stays static. Sizing for Data Security Broker Shield depends on the number of shields and the number of concurrent users.\n\nWhat are the prerequisites for installing Data Security Broker?\n\nMake sure you meet the following requirements before configuring Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield:\n\n\n\n* Admin privileges for your platform\n* The user account used to log in to the Data Security Broker Shield host machine must have a home directory on that system\n* SSH client\n* Private key pair\n* Database privileges for encryption and migration\n\n\n\nDo Data Security Broker Manager and Shield run on different instances?\n\nTechnically, it is possible for the Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield to both run on the same host. However, it is recommended that separate host instances are provisioned for the Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield, to accommodate different workloads.\n\nWhich OS is necessary to set up the Data Security Broker Shield?\n\nData Security Broker Shield can be installed on instances running with Ubuntu 18 for IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster (IKS) or RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 for IBM Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes cluster (ROKS).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_faqs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Fires on that scale are unusual, but not unique. As a business, should you spend time and money making sure that your computer systems could survive such a fire? The answer depends on various factors, but if for instance, your entire customer base is in Chicago, worrying about events that will wipe out the whole city is likely not useful. So it is worth thinking about what sorts of things might fail, how likely they are to happen, and how damaging they would be, before deciding what level of redundancy is appropriate.\n\n\n\n Geographic redundancy \n\nLevels of redundancy have both a technical and a geographic component. If you have two houses, are you more likely to become homeless if the houses are next door to each other or if they are in different countries? Similar considerations drive computer system redundancy, and are behind IBM\u00ae\u2019s use of local, regional, and global redundancy. Local redundancy duplicates some or all of a computer system in the same data center. This protects against many kinds of outages, but not all. Regional redundancy, as implemented by IBM, provides at least three copies of the system in three different data centers, so a single local event, like a large fire, is unlikely to take down all the systems. Global redundancy is available for customers that want to avoid outages that are caused by large regional events such as severe hurricanes and typhoons.\n\nZoom\n\n![Geographic levels of redundancy.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/adcecdbe4e86955f88aac7f3c1e7ec3ff44992ef\/overview\/images\/geographic-redundancy.svg)\n\nFigure 2.

The channels property of the generic response object provides a way to do this.\n\nThis mechanism is useful if your conversation flow does not change based on the integration in use, and if you cannot know in advance what integration the response is sent to at run time. By using channels, you can define a single step that supports all integrations, while still customizing the output for each channel. For example, you might want to customize the text formatting, or even send different response types, based on what the channel supports.\n\nUsing channels is useful along with the channel_transfer response type. Because the message output is processed both by the channel that initiates the transfer and by the target channel, you can use channels to define responses that are processed by one or the other. (For more information, and an example, see [Channel transfer](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-assistant-responses-jsonassistant-responses-json-channel-transfer).)\n\nTo specify the integrations for which a response is intended, include the optional channels array as part of the response object.

If the response contains multiple media types or attachments, the generic response is converted into a series of separate message payloads as needed. These are sent to the channel in separate messages.\n\nWhen a response is split into multiple messages, the integration sends these messages to the channel in sequence. It is the responsibility of the channel to deliver these messages to the end user; this can be affected by network or server issues.\n\nIf you are building your own client application, your app must implement each response type as appropriate. For more information, see [Implementing responses](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses).\n\n\n\n\n\n Targeting specific integrations \n\nIf you plan to use integrations to deploy your assistant to multiple channels, you might want to send different responses to different integrations. The channels property of the generic response object provides a way to do this.\n\nThis mechanism is useful if your dialog flow does not change based on the integration in use, and if you cannot know in advance what integration the response will be sent to at run time. By using channels, you can define a single dialog node that supports all integrations, while still customizing the output for each channel. For example, you might want to customize the text formatting, or even send different response types, based on what the channel supports.\n\nUsing channels is particularly useful in conjunction with the channel_transfer response type. Because the message output is processed both by the channel initiating the transfer and by the target channel, you can use channels to define responses that will only be displayed by one or the other. (For more information, and an example, see [Channel transfer](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-responses-jsondialog-responses-json-channel-transfer).)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-responses-json"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03165-6110-8133","score":18.21896,"text":"\n* Base URL: This URL is the REST API endpoint for the SMS service you are using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optimize your dialog for messaging \n\nFor the best customer experience, design your dialog with the capabilities of the Twilio integration in mind:\n\n\n\n* Do not include HTML elements in your text responses.\n* You can send media files or even documents in your response.

See [Digressions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-digressions) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sample dialog \n\nThis diagram shows a mockup of a dialog tree that is built with the graphical user interface dialog editor.\n\n![A sample dialog tree with example content](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/dialog-depiction-full.png)\n\nThe dialog tree in this diagram contains two root dialog nodes.

When you add a preference property that indicates dropdown as the preference, for example, you can see in the \"Try it out\" pane that the list is displayed as a drop-down list instead.\n\n![Shows a small options list in the Preview that is displayed as a drop-down menu.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/options-dropdown.png)\n\nSome integration types, such as the web chat, reflect your preference. Other integration types, such as Slack, do not reflect your preference when they render the options.\n\n\n\nDo not add more than one option response type to a single dialog node because both lists are displayed at once, but the customer can choose an option from only one of them.\n\nIf you need to be able to populate the list of options with different values based on some other factors, you can design a dynamic options list. For more information, see the [How to Dynamically Add Response Options to Dialog Nodes](https:\/\/medium.com\/ibm-watson\/how-to-dynamically-add-response-options-to-dialog-nodes-in-watson-assistant-e14c5e08beca) blog post.\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding a Pause response type \n\nAdd a pause response type to give the assistant time to respond. For example, you might add a pause response type to a node that calls a webhook. The pause indicates that the assistant is working on an answer, which gives the assistant time to make the webhook call and get a response. Then, you can jump to a child node to show the result.\n\nTo add a Pause response type, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the dialog node where you want to add the response type, click the dropdown menu in the Assistant responds field, and then choose Pause.\n2.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03158-15247-17131","score":17.199799,"text":"\n* You can include search skill response types in dialog nodes that the phone integration will read.

The origin server can serve up all of the content for a website, provided that the web traffic does not extend beyond the server's processing capabilities and latency is not a primary concern. A global load balancer manages a pool implementation that allows for the traffic to be distributed to multiple origins. This pool capability provides many benefits including:\n\n\n\n* Minimizes response time\n* Creates higher availability through redundancy\n* Maximizes traffic throughput\n\n\n\nA global load balancer routes traffic to the pool with the highest priority, distributing the load among its origin servers. See the following Pool section for how traffic is distributed within a pool. If the primary pool becomes unavailable, traffic is routed automatically to the next pool in the list based on priority.\n\nIf pools are set up for specific regions, traffic from those regions is sent to the pools for the specified region first. Traffic falls back to the default pools only when all pools for a given region are down. In this case the fallback pool is the pool with the lowest priority.\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nWhen a global load balancer is created, a DNS record is automatically added for it with the name of the load balancer. The load balancer then returns one of the origin IP addresses to a client making a DNS request.\n\nFor example, an origin pool is created with two origins identifying IP addresses 169.61.244.18 and 169.61.244.19. If a global load balancer is created with the name glbcust.ibmmo.com using the origin pool, then a client on the internet can execute the command:\n\n$ ping glbcust.ibmmo.com\nPING glbcust.ibmmo.com (169.61.244.18): 56 data bytes\n\nIn this example, CIS:\n\n\n\n* Created a DNS record named glbcust.ibmmo.com.\n* Used the global load balancer to resolve the DNS name to one of the IP addresses identified in the origin pool.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-global-load-balancer-glb-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15994-4553-5739","score":8.334529,"text":"\nWhy it\u2019s happening \n\nIf you remove IAM authorization from Cloud Block Storage to the KMS before you delete all BYOK volumes or images, the root key fails to unregister from the resource.\n\n How to fix it \n\nAs best practice, delete all storage or image resources before you remove IAM authorization.

These are designed to allow the SRE team to pro-actively respond to service impacting or service threatening events or conditions. When a site is unavailable, or there are infrastructure issues leading to monitor alerts, an incident record is automatically generated within our Incident Management System.\n\nAt the same time, for production environments, a SRE Incident Response Team (IRT) provides 24\/7 critical outage support. The goal of IRT is to ensure our customer's applications are running when they should, and to provide effective and timely customer communication during availability incidents or Severity 1 cases during off hours. IRT is sometimes referred to as the \"on call\" team.\n\nPlease note IRT is not considered standard support. It is for emergency and Sev1 cases only.

This API offers significant advantages over the v1 runtime API, including automatic state management, ease of deployment, skill versioning, and the availability of new features such as the search skill.\n\nThe v2 API is available for all users, regardless of service plan, at no additional cost.\n\nThe v2 API currently supports only runtime interaction with an existing assistant. Authoring applications that create or modify workspaces should continue to use the v1 API.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nWith the v2 API, your client app communicates with an assistant, which is an orchestration layer that offers several capabilities, including automatic state management, skill versioning, and easier deployment.\n\nAll communication with an assistant takes place within the context of a session, which maintains conversation state throughout the duration of the conversation. State data, including any context variables that are defined by your dialog or client application, are automatically stored by Watson Assistant, without any action required on the part of your application.\n\nState data persists until you explicitly delete the session, or until the session times out because of inactivity.\n\nIf you prefer to manage state yourself, the v2 API also provides a stateless message method that functions more like the v1 API. If you use the stateless message method, you do not need to explicitly create or delete sessions, and your app is responsible for maintaining context. For more information about the stateless message method, see the [API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2messagestateless).\n\nIf you have an existing application that uses the v1 API to send user input directly to a workspace, migrating your app to use the v2 API is a straightforward process.\n\n\n\n\n\n Assistant ID \n\nThe v2 runtime API sends messages to an assistant. On the Assistant Settings page, find the assistant ID. Your application uses this ID to communicate with the assistant. The service credentials are the same for both the v1 and v2 APIs.\n\nCurrently, there is no API support for retrieving an assistant ID.

Is there a way to effectively test features in production, and immediately roll them back if needed?\n\nHi, my name is Dilan Orrino with IBM Cloud. I'll be answering those questions by discussing feature flags, or sometimes referred to as feature toggle, or switches.\n\nFeature flags are conditions that encompass feature code that allow you to flip them on and off at will. Okay, let's use an example. [Draw] Let's say we've got an ice cream shop franchise that's looking to expand to a new city and we've got a [Draw] banner that we want to display on our website.

Instead, reflecting the different use cases and infrastructure maintenance requirements for Satellite-based deployments, users are charged a flat rate for each location where they want Key Protect installed and then an additional rate depending on the quota of keys they select at deployment time.\n\nBecause of the way Key Protect structures its billing system, you cannot delete the first instance you deploy unless you plan to uninstall Key Protect from your Satellite location completely.\n\n\n\n Details \n\nPricing is for Key Protect on Satellite only and does not include the price of a Satellite location or the price to install IBM Cloud Database (ICD) creation in your location.\n\nPricing for Key Protect on Satellite is based on two metrics:\n\n\n\n* Base price: a monthly base price charged for the installation of Key Protect into a Satellite location. This is $780 a month per location. Note that there is no additional charge for creating multiple instances in a location.\n* Key quota: the maximum number of [non-deleted keys](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-pricing-plan-satellitepricing-plan-satellite-non-deleted) which is defined when Key Protect is deployed in the Satellite location. This quota covers the number of keys per location, not per instance. If you choose to create a second instance, it is bound by the quota selected for the location. You do not need to increase your quota. Keys cost $1 per key, while quotas can be requested in batches of 100 keys. Because the minimum quota that can be selected is 100, the minimum quota charge is $100. If 200 keys are selected, for example, the charge is $200. This quota of keys can be changed later by opening a service ticket. If you attempt to exceed your key quota, you will get an error.\n\n\n\nIf you change quotas in the middle of a billing cycle (for example, going from 100 keys to 200 keys) you are charged whichever quota is larger.

When you query the view, IBM Cloudant first indexes the 250 new documents, and then returns the answer.\n* An alternative is adding the stale=ok parameter to the API call. This parameter means, return me the data that is already indexed. I don't care about the latest updates. In other words, when you query the view with stale=ok, IBM Cloudant returns the answer immediately, without any additional reindexing.\n* A second alternative is to add the stale=update_after parameter to the API call.

The stale parameter isn't a perfect solution for all use cases. However, it can provide timely responses on fast-changing data sets if your application is happy to accept stale results.

The style is upbeat, welcoming, and conveys a positive message.\n* empathetic - Expresses empathy and compassion. The style has sympathetic undertones, but it is not excessively sorrowful.\n* neutral - Expresses objectivity and evenness.

The replacement worker node is created in the same zone, same worker pool, and with the same flavor as the deleted worker node.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-update"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05713-127908-129372","score":13.641361,"text":"\n* [What if I want to set up multiple clusters across regions?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-ha_clustersmultiple-regions-setup)\n* [What options do I have to load balance workloads across multiple clusters?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-ha_clustersmultiple-cluster-lb-options)\n* [Setting up a CIS global load balancer](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusterscis-global-lb-setup)\n* [Setting up your own global load balancer](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-ha_clustersbyo-global-lb-setup)\n* [What if I want to load balance workloads on the private network?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-ha_clustersglb-private)\n\n\n\n\n\n[Planning your worker node setup](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesplanning_worker_nodes)\n\n\n\n* [Available hardware for worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesshared_dedicated_node)\n\n\n\n* [What flavors are available to me?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesavailable-flavors)\n* [Can I combine different flavors in a cluster?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodescombine-flavors)\n* [How can I change worker node flavors?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodeschange-flavors)\n* [Are the worker nodes encrypted?]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_sitemap"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

The Standard plan is best suited for workloads that have large amount of storage and relatively small Outbound bandwidth (Outbound bandwidth < 20% of Storage capacity). The plan offers flexible choices for storage class based on data access patterns (lower the cost, the less frequently data is accessed). The Standard plan bills for every stored capacity ($\/GB\/month), Outbound bandwidth ($\/GB), class A ($\/1,000), class B ($\/10,000) and retrieval ($\/GB) metrics, where applicable.\n* One Rate plan is suited for active workloads with large amounts of Outbound bandwidth (or varying Outbound bandwidth) as a percent of their Storage capacity (Outbound bandwidth > 20% of Storage capacity). Typical workloads belong to large enterprises and ISVs which may have sub-accounts with multiple divisions\/departments or end-users. The plan offers a predictable TCO with an all-inclusive flat monthly charge ($\/GB\/month) that includes capacity, and built-in allowances for Outbound bandwidth and Operational requests.

When you assign a user an Enterprise account management service policy within a child account in an enterprise, the user can't manage the enterprise to which the account belongs. Depending on the assigned role for the Enterprise account management service in the enterprise account, the user can perform specific actions:\n\n\n\n* Create new accounts in the enterprise\n* Create and name account groups\n* Move accounts between account groups\n* Import existing accounts to the enterprise\n* Update the enterprise name or domain\n* View usage reports for the enterprise, a specific account group, accounts within account groups, or a specific account\n\n\n\nA policy that gives a user access to the enterprise service can either be assigned on the entire enterprise or only on a specific account group or single account.\n\nTypically, the enterprise account itself doesn't contain many resources. Instead, resources are created in the child accounts of the enterprise. It is within each of these accounts that users can be invited and given access to manage and work with resources. The access and membership that a user has in the enterprise account does not apply to the account groups and child accounts in the enterprise hierarchy. User management and access management remain isolated to each account as you can see depicted in the following diagrams.\n\nThe first diagram shows how you can assign a policy to a user in the enterprise account to manage the entire enterprise. The second diagram shows a policy that is scoped to an account group that provides access to manage only that account group and the child accounts that are organized within it.\n\nZoom\n\n![Enterprise access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/d4595e5202a9a27767cf034e81b038cdf772e0d5\/secure-enterprise\/images\/enterprise-access.svg)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-assign-access-enterprise"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12540-4798-6573","score":7.1006527,"text":"\nBy default, the enterprise is created with the currently logged-in user in the following roles:\n\n\n\n* The contact for the enterprise, which identifies a focal person to notify with enterprise-related concerns\n* The owner of the enterprise account, which has full access to manage the enterprise account\n\n\n\nYou can specify the IBMid for a different user on the --primary-contact-id option.

This index size is good, since index size contributes to storage costs.\n* The index is robust. Since the index does not store the document, you can access any field without thinking ahead about what to store in the index.\n* The disadvantage is that getting the document back is more costly than the alternative of emitting data into the index itself. First, the database has to look up the requested key in the index and then read the associated document. Also, if you\u2019re reading the whole document, but need only a single field, you\u2019re making the database read and transmit data that you don\u2019t need.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":52.09824,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":45.38116,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04334-39121-41053","score":15.558918,"text":"\nValid values for group are all, domain, reliability, performance, security.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04107-6095-8145","score":21.76423,"text":"\nThis tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Each voice has a default speaking rate that is optimized to represent a normal rate of speech. The parameter accepts an integer that represents the percentage change from the voice's default:\n\n\n\n* Specify a signed negative integer to reduce the speaking rate by that percentage. For example, -10 reduces the rate by ten percent.\n* Specify an unsigned or signed positive integer to increase the speaking rate by that percentage. For example, 10 and +10 increase the rate by ten percent.\n* Specify 0 or omit the parameter to get the default speaking rate for the voice.\n\n\n\nThe best way to determine how the parameter affects the rate of a given voice is to experiment with different values.

They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done. What it needs, in the form of the secret here, is what we call \"DB configs.\" Again, this DB config is going to allow it to have the correct communication with the service by saying, this is who I am and this is what I came here to accomplish.\n\nBut now that we have our user credentials in our DB configs as examples of secrets, we realize the vulnerability that can be created here if these credentials were to fall into the wrong hands. And this is why it's so important to establish a centralized place to manage all these things as we build out more applications and microservices. As we have more of these, the problem becomes more complex. If it falls into the wrong hands, how is protected? How do we block it from getting to that point? How was that data isolated?\n\nWhen we look at the damage that this can cause, we're looking in the millions of dollars, for example, for a data breach.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12415-7-1973","score":12.377832,"text":"\nFAQs for Secrets Manager \n\nFAQs for IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager might include questions about secrets or credentials. To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05477-6180-7926","score":12.31425,"text":"\nThe output of this command typically contains one <REGISTRY> key.\n4. Confirm the following information about the key:\n\na. Look at the <REGISTRY> value. This value must match the image of the build.\n\n\n\n* If the image name is on IBM Cloud Container Registry, for example us.icr.io\/aNamespace\/anImage, then the <REGISTRY> needs to be us.icr.io.\n* If the image name is docker.io\/aNamespace\/aRepository or \/aNamespace\/aRepository without any hostname, then the build is using Docker Hub. In this case, the <REGISTRY> must be https:\/\/index.docker.io\/v1\/.\n\n\n\nb. Look at the <USERNAME> value. If the registry is an IBM Cloud Container Registry, then an API key must be used for authentication. The <USERNAME> needs to be iamapikey and the password needs to be an API key. See [Automating access to IBM Cloud Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_access) for steps to create the API key.\n\nc. The credentials need to be validated. IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows permissions to be assigned in a fine-grained way. For example, a service ID with access to an IBM Cloud Container Registry namespace and the permission to pull images, might not be allowed to push images. But, this permission is what is needed in this case.\n5. After you determine the changes that are needed, create a container registry secret that uses corrected values. Use the [ibmcloud ce secret create --format](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-clicli-secret-create) command; for example,\n\nibmcloud ce secret create --format registry --name <REGISTRY_SECRET> --server <REGISTRY_SERVER> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>\n6.

Then, if you don't need them anymore, you can delete the groups.\n\nSimilar to the way that\n\nresource groupshelp to ensure correct policy enforcement at the platform level, you can create secret groups at the instance level to organize secrets.\n\nZoom\n\n![The image shows two examples of a secret group and how they're mapped to access groups. One where the reader role is assigned and one where the manager role is assigned. The content is explained fully in the surrounding text.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/991f60ddbe3ab0a9aa69481a07a0a73b359fa329\/secrets-manager\/\/images\/secret-group.svg)\n\nFigure 1. Assigning access to secret groups\n\nAs shown in the previous image, users with Reader access to a secret group can see that the group exists and understand which secrets are assigned to it. Users with Writer access can view and edit the secret group and secrets themselves. By design, the default secret group inherits all of the same permissions that are set for the instance.\n\nYou can choose to group your secrets by phase of development, specific to the type of roles that people on your team have, or in any way that might help you. Each secret can be mapped to one group only and the mapping occurs at the time of secret creation.\n\nTo learn about the suggested guidelines for using secret groups, check out [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you begin, be sure that you have the required level of access.

If a deployment does not meet the policies that you set, the admission controller blocks the deployment in your cluster. \n\n\n\nWhat options do I have to scan running containers for vulnerabilities?\n: You can install third-party solutions in your cluster, such as [Twistlock](https:\/\/www.paloaltonetworks.com\/prisma\/cloud) or [StackRox](https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/technologies\/cloud-computing\/openshift\/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes) to scan running containers and block malicious activities when they are detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n Container isolation and security \n\nWhen you run multiple apps in your cluster, you want to make sure that your workloads run isolated from each other and that you restrict the permissions of your pods within the cluster to avoid noisy neighbors or denial-of-service attacks.\n\nWhat is a Kubernetes namespace and why should I use it?\n: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to virtually partition a cluster and provide isolation for your deployments and the groups of users that want to move their workload onto the cluster.

For example, if most or all pods don't require access to specific pods or services, and you want to ensure that pods by default can't access those pods or services, you can create a Kubernetes network policy to block ingress traffic to those pods or services. Kubernetes network policies can also help you enforce workload isolation between namespaces by controlling how pods and services in different namespaces can communicate.\n\nHow can I control pod permissions?\n: To control pod permissions within or across projects, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud uses security context constraints (SCCs). By default, every cluster is set up with [Red Hat OpenShift SCCs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs) and a set of [IBM-provided SCCs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccibm_sccs) that you can assign to service accounts, pods, deployments, or projects to limit the permissions within the cluster. If you don't explicitly assign an SCC, your pods use the restricted SCC. Red Hat OpenShift SCCs are stricter than the default pod security policies in community Kubernetes clusters.

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions.

For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more. For the full list of aggregation options, see the [Aggregations table](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-aggregations). These aggregations are written using the [Discovery Query Language](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-operators).\n\n\n\n\n\n natural_language_query","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parameters"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13369-9745-11531","score":19.846838,"text":"\nSee [Example 3: Interim results is true and low latency is false](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-interiminterim-low-latency-examples-three). \n interim_results=true low_latency=true The service returns interim results as it develops transcription hypotheses, and it sends final results for utterances as they become complete. The service delivers one or more interim results for each final result. The quality of interim results is identical to what you receive with previous-generation models.

To receive final results between multiple recognition requests, the client must signal the end of transmission for the previous request before it sends a subsequent request. After it returns the final results for the first request, the service returns another {\"state\":\"listening\"} message to the client. This message indicates that the service is ready to receive another request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Send additional requests and modify request parameters \n\nWhile the WebSocket connection remains active, the client can continue to use the connection to send further recognition requests with new audio. By default, the service continues to use the parameters that were sent with the previous start message for all subsequent requests that are sent over the same connection.\n\nTo change the parameters for subsequent requests, the client can send another start message with the new parameters after it receives the final recognition results and a new {\"state\":\"listening\"} message from the service. The client can change any parameters except for those parameters that are specified when the connection is opened (model, language_customization_id, and so on).\n\nThe following example sends a start message with new parameters for subsequent recognition requests that are sent over the connection.

You can choose to customize the information that is injected in to the tokens by the service. By injecting the information into your tokens, it's available to your application at run time without you having to configure extra network calls. For more information about tokens and how they're used in App ID, see [Understanding tokens](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-tokens).\n\nBy customizing your token configuration, you can ensure that your security and user experience needs are met. However, should a token ever become compromised, a malicious user might have more information or time that can be used to affect your application. Be sure that you understand the security implications of the customizations that you want to make before you make them.\n\n\n\n Understanding custom claims mapping \n\nA claim is a statement that an entity makes about itself or on behalf of someone else. For example, if you signed into an application by using an identity provider, the provider would send the application a group of claims or statements about you to the app so that it can group with information that it already knows about you. This way, when you sign in, the app is set up with your information, in the way that you configured it.\n\n\n\n What types of claims can I define? \n\nThe claims that are provided by App ID fall into several categories that are differentiated by their level of customization.\n\nNormalized claims\n: In each identity token, there is a set of claims that is recognized by App ID as normalized. When available, the claims are mapped directly from your identity provider to the token by default. The claims can't be explicitly omitted but they can be overwritten in your token by custom claims. The claims include name, email, picture, and locale.\n\nRestricted claims\n: Restricted claims are those that have limited customization possibilities and cannot be overwritten by custom mappings. For an access token, scope is the only restricted claim. Although it cannot be overwritten, it can be extended with your own scope.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-customizing-tokens"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12498-1639-3565","score":10.863797,"text":"\nWith these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them.

For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done.

After receiving that email, you have the option to [import the SSL certificate](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/infrastructure\/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-importing-ssl-certificatesimporting-ssl-certificates) to the IBM Cloud\u00ae console should you choose to use the certificate with IBM Cloud products and services. Because IBM Cloud never receives the details for SSL certificate, data cannot be imported automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an SSL certificate? \n\nSSL certificates are enabled by websites as a security measure to protect the user. They are generally used when you are required to transmit confidential information to a website, such as name, address, credit card numbers, and other personal data or are managing data that requires authentication (such as in the IBM Cloud console). SSL certificates are requested by the company that runs the website but are issued by a trusted, third-party company that ensures the validity of the website. Secure websites are preceded by HTTPS in the URL, as opposed to the standard HTTP.\n\n\n\n\n\n How can I order an SHA2 SSL? \n\nIf you already ordered an SSL and it is showing errors that the SSL certificate is using SHA-1 instead of SHA-2, you need to request that the SSL is re-issued. You can do this by submitting a ticket.\n\nIf you have not yet ordered an SSL from IBM Cloud and need to order one with SHA-2, submit a ticket to manually order an SSL for the domain in question. IBM Cloud console still automatically creates SSL certificates using SHA-1, so if you do this, you will then need to have it re-issued.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why do I need to choose an email? \n\nTo create an SSL certificate, you need to verify that you own the domain where you are requesting the SSL certificate.

With Satellite, since hosts reside on a variety of different infrastructure, the autoscaler can't provision and remove worker nodes automatically. Instead, on Satellite clusters, the cluster autoscaler uses only hosts that are already available and ready in the location. This means you need keep additional hosts available in location for the autoscaler to use during scale up.\n\nWhat type of hosts does cluster autoscaler use while scaling up the cluster?\n: Hosts with Ready status and the unassigned state are considered available for use by the cluster autoscaler.\n\nWhich of the available hosts can be used during scale-up?\n: Of the Ready and unassigned hosts, only the hosts whose labels match the labels of the worker pool where scaling is enabled can be used for scaling. When attaching hosts to your location, make sure to label the hosts you want to use in your autoscaled worker pools.\n\nHow does the cluster autoscaler impact billing?\n: Since the cluster autoscaler doesn't perform any operations at infrastructure level, however it does assign hosts to worker pools, which means [Cluster management fees](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-faqspricing) are incurred.\n\nAfter a scaling event, what do I do with the hosts that were used for scaling that are now in a Reload requried state?\n: After scaling, hosts enter a Reload required state and can't be used for scaling again, until they are rebooted. Unassign these hosts from the worker pool, remove them from your location, reboot them, and reattach to make them available for scaling again.\n\nHow do I set up autoscaling in my Satellite cluster\n: To set up autoscaling, you must complete the following steps.\n\n\n\n1.

How do I fix it? \n\nIf you use more than two iSCSI LUNs with the same host, and if all the iSCSI connections are from the same Storage device, you might find that you can see only two devices in Disk Manager. When this situation happens, you need to manually connect to each device in the iSCSI Initiator. For more information, see [troubleshooting Windows\u00ae 2012 R2 - multiple iSCSI devices](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-troubleshootingWin12).\n\n\n\n\n\n My storage appears offline or read-only. Why did it happen and how do I fix it? \n\nIn a couple of scenarios a host (bare metal or VM) might lose connection to the storage briefly and as a result, the host considers that storage read-only to avoid data corruption. Most of the time the loss of connectivity is network-related but the status of the storage remains read-only from the host's perspective even when the network connection is restored. A restart of the host solves the read-only state issue.\n\nThis issue can be observed with hosts that have incorrect MPIO settings. When MPIO is not configured correctly, the host loses connection to the storage, and might not be able to reconnect to the storage when the connectivity issue is resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I attach the Block Storage for Classic with a single path?

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups.

When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00020-4245-6252","score":19.313398,"text":"\n<br><br> * [Working with Spark SQL and an external metastore](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-external-metastore)<br><br><br> \n Running applications with resource overcommitment There is a quota associated with each Analytics Engine Serverless instance. When applications are submitted on an instance, they are allocated resources from the instance quota. If an application requests resources beyond the available quota, the application will either not start or will run with less than the requested resources, which might result in the application running slower than expected or, in some cases, in the application failing.

A proxy server protects a client machine\u2019s identity by using an intermediary (for outgoing traffic), but a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy that protects the server from exposure by having the client's traffic pass through the WAF before reaching the server (for incoming traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Types of attacks WAF can prevent \n\nA WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others. A WAF usually is part of a suite of tools, which together can create a holistic defense against a range of attack vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How a WAF works \n\nA WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic.\n\nThe value of a WAF comes from the speed and ease with which its policy modifications can be implemented, thereby allowing a faster response to varying attack vectors. For example, during a [DDoS attack](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Denial-of-service_attack), rate limiting can be implemented by modifying WAF policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Key benefits of a CIS WAF \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services WAF is an easy way to set up, manage, and customize security rules to protect your web applications from common web threats. See the following list for key features:\n\n\n\n*  Easy setup - The CIS WAF is part of our overall service, which takes just a few minutes to set up. After you redirect your DNS to us, you can switch on the WAF and set up the rules you need.\n*  Detailed reporting - See greater detail in the reporting, for example, threats blocked by rule\/rule group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-waf-q-and-a"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14445-7-1973","score":14.016214,"text":"\nJuniper vSRX on IBM Cloud overview \n\nJuniper\u00ae vSRX on IBM Cloud is a virtual security appliance that provides security and networking services at the perimeter or edge in virtualized private or public cloud environments. Within a VMware\u00ae infrastructure, vSRX runs as a pair of virtual machines (VMs) within the VMware vSphere\u00ae environment. Juniper vSRX on IBM Cloud is a non-IBM product that is offered under terms and conditions from Juniper Network, not IBM.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae for VMware Solutions offers promotions for some add-on services. Promotional pricing offers a number of months without charge for a service license, if the service has license charges. For more information, see [Promotions for VMware Solutions add-on services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vc_addingservicesvc_addingservices-service-promotions).\n\nThe Juniper vSRX version available for deployment is 3.0 (23.1R1).\n\nFor more information about vSRX and the vSRX 3.0 architecture, see [vSRX Deployment Guide for Private and Public Cloud Platforms](https:\/\/www.juniper.net\/documentation\/us\/en\/software\/vsrx\/vsrx-consolidated-deployment-guide\/index.html).\n\nYou can install Juniper vSRX as one of the following components:\n\n\n\n* As a virtual appliance on the management cluster. In this case, Juniper vSRX protects the traffic in the management cluster. That is, the service protects only the traffic that you forward from your devices, for example, setting the default gateway to point to Juniper vSRX.\n* As a security or gateway appliance on the gateway cluster. In this case, Juniper vSRX works like a gateway appliance, which you can set without having to configure any devices. Juniper vSRX protects all clusters in the same pod and data center. With this deployment, you route all traffic in the same pod and data center to protect a broader portion of the system.\n\nYou cannot install Juniper vSRX and FortiGate Virtual Appliance on the same gateway cluster.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-juniper-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04179-4669-6415","score":13.452045,"text":"\nThese initial settings can reduce false positives by populating Security Events for further tuning.

This is a general best practice. By creating separate IBM Analytics Engine instances for different environments, you can test any configuration and code changes before applying them on the production instance.

Services usually do not require installation or maintenance and can be combined to create applications. An instance of a service is an entity that consists of resources that are reserved for a particular application or a service.\n\nWhen you create an IBM Analytics Engine from the catalog, you will give the service instance a name of your choice, select the default Spark runtime you want to associate with the instance and provide the default Spark configuration to use with the instance. Additionally, you need have to specify the Instance home, which is the storage attached to the instance for instance related data only.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n* When you create an IBM Analytics Engine service instance, no costs are incurred unless you have Spark applications running or the Spark history server is accessed.\n* Costs are incurred if IBM Cloud Object Storage if accessed through public endpoints, and when you enable forwarding IBM Analytics Engine logs to IBM Log Analysis.\n* There is a default limit on the number of service instances permitted per IBM Cloud\u00ae account and on the amount of CPU and memory that can be used in any given IBM Analytics Engine service instance. See [Limits and quotas for Analytics Engine instances](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-limits).

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan.

Dedicated hosts offer virtual server provisioning capacity and maximum placement control.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the benefits of using dedicated hosts over dedicated instances? \n\nBoth offerings are guaranteed single tenancy. Dedicated hosts provide the flexibility to specify on which host to provision dedicated host instances, and these other benefits:\n\n\n\n* Control over which IBM Cloud data center the server is placed\n* Ability to manage your servers as workload requirements change; for example, migrate virtual servers between your dedicated hosts on the same POD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I keep my existing dedicated instances or do I need to set up a dedicated host and dedicated host instances? \n\nYes, you can keep your existing dedicated instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I interchange provisioning of dedicated instances (auto\u2013assigned) and dedicated host instances? \n\nNo. Existing auto-assigned dedicated instances cannot be reprovisioned on dedicated hosts. If you require virtual server placement, you need to provision them on dedicated hosts as dedicated host instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n What type of server, virtual or bare metal, supports the dedicated host offering? \n\nThe offering is supported on virtual servers; IBM Cloud does have a bare metal offering. The differences between virtual hosts and bare metal servers are the time to provision and virtualization management.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the provisioning lifecycle of a dedicated host? \n\nDedicated hosts are allocated to users when provisioned. They persist to the account until it is reclaimed. Dedicated hosts are offered in only on-demand pricing, hourly or monthly, so when reclaimed, billing models charge as either hourly or monthly IBM Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is the dedicated host offering billed? \n\nYou can purchase dedicated hosts on-demand with hourly or monthly billing. Hourly only hosts allow only hourly instances to be provisioned; monthly only hosts allow provisioning of monthly and hourly instances. Pricing for dedicated hosts includes core, RAM, local SSD storage, and network port speeds. Premium operating systems, storage area network (SAN) storage, and software add-on prices and licensing are charged based on the instance deployed\u2014hourly or monthly\u2014on the dedicated host. The same pricing model as IBM Cloud public and dedicated instances is followed for these items.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-faqs-dedicated-hosts-and-instances"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-874737-876784","score":20.581427,"text":"\nIf you require a higher level of service for automatic disaster recovery, see IBM's [Cloud disaster recovery solutions](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/disaster-recovery).\n* How many copies of my backup can I create in other regions?\n\n How many copies of my backup can I create in other regions? \n\nYou can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region, and later use that snapshot to restore a volume in the new region.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage.

You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08671-108191-109525","score":24.348646,"text":"\n[FAQs: Pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricingfaq-pricing)\n\n\n\n* [How am I charged for my use of Hyper Protect Crypto Services standard plan?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricingfaq-how-charge-hpcs)\n* [How am I charged for my use of Hyper Protect Crypto Services with Unified Key Orchestrator?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricingfaq-how-charge-hpcs-uko)\n* [Is there a free trial for Hyper Protect Crypto Services?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricingfaq-free-trial)\n\n\n\n[FAQs: Provisioning and operations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-provisioning-operationsfaq-provisioning-operations)\n\n\n\n* [Are there any prerequisites for using Hyper Protect Crypto Services?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-provisioning-operationsfaq-hpcs-prerequisites)\n* [How to initialize Hyper Protect Crypto Services service instances?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-provisioning-operationsfaq-how-to-initialize)\n* [Can I initialize my service instance through the TKE CLI plug-in by using a proxy?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-provisioning-operationsfaq-tke-proxy)\n* [Are there any recommendations on how to set up smart cards?]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-882118-884014","score":22.94035,"text":"\nYou can also [create stand-alone volumes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storagecreate-standalone-vol) and later attach them to your instances.\n* How many instances can share a provisioned Block Storage for VPC volume?\n\n How many instances can share a provisioned Block Storage for VPC volume? \n\nA Block Storage for VPC volume can be attached to only one instance at a time.
