These shapes , and the periods of time when the Moon shows them , are called the intermediate phases . They last , on average , one - quarter of a synodic month , roughly 7.38 days , but their durations vary slightly because the Moon 's orbit is slightly elliptical , and thus its speed in orbit is not constant .

The method took advantage of the fact that the Moon is actually closest to an observer when it is at its highest point in the sky , compared to when it is on the horizon . Although it appears that the Moon is biggest when it is near the horizon , the opposite is true . This phenomenon is known as the moon illusion .

He had been outraged by Jinnah 's Direct Action campaign , which had provoked communal violence across India , and by the viceroy 's vetoes of his home department 's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality . Patel severely criticised the viceroy 's induction of League ministers into the government , and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress 's approval . Although further outraged at the League 's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government , he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims , and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu - Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences . The continuation of a divided and weak central government would , in Patel 's mind , result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence . In December 1946 and January 1947 , Patel worked with civil servant V.P. Menon on the latter 's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim - majority provinces . Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition . Patel , a fierce critic of Jinnah 's demand that the Hindu - majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state , obtained the partition of those provinces , thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan . Patel 's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public , which had tired of the League 's tactics , but he was criticised by Gandhi , Nehru , secular Muslims , and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so . When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947 , Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal . Knowing Gandhi 's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition , Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over what he saw as the practical unworkability of any Congress -- League coalition , the rising violence , and the threat of civil war .

But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing `` fullest peace '' for having done `` their duty '' . Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British had employed ruthless means of suppression , the Quit India movement was `` by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857 '' , as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill . More than 100,000 people were arrested and many were killed in violent struggles with the police . Strikes , protests , and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India .

Its contents are unknown . It was not submitted formally and there is no mention of it in the Society 's records . Jenner had sent the paper informally to Sir Joseph Banks , the Society 's president , who asked Everard Home for his views . His report , published for the first time in 1999 , was sceptical and called for further vaccinations . These were done and in 1798 Jenner published an analysis of 23 ' cases ' including several individuals who had resisted natural exposure after previous cowpox . It is not known how many Jenner vaccinated or challenged by inoculation with smallpox virus ; e.g. Case 21 included ' several children and adults ' . Crucially all of at least four who Jenner deliberately inoculated with smallpox virus resisted it . These included the first and last patients in a series of arm - to - arm transfers . He concluded that cowpox inoculation was a safe alternative to smallpox inoculation , but rashly claimed that the protective effect was lifelong . This last proved to be incorrect . Jenner also tried to distinguish between ' True ' cowpox which produced the desired result and ' Spurious ' cowpox which was ineffective and \/ or produced severe reaction . Modern research suggests Jenner was trying to distinguish between effects caused by what would now be recognised as noninfectious vaccine , a different virus ( e.g. paravaccinia \/ milker 's nodes ) , or contaminating bacterial pathogens . This caused confusion at the time , but would become important criteria in vaccine development . A further source of confusion was Jenner 's belief that fully effective vaccine obtained from cows originated in an equine disease , which he mistakenly referred to as grease .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) .

Often , infected people are isolated from the rest of the community , and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine . To control the outbreak of foot - and - mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001 , thousands of cattle were slaughtered .

Somewhat overlapping , but mainly following the incubation period , there is a period of communicability -- a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal . This , too , is known for many viral infections , and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks .

Knowledge of the mechanism by which this strain of HIV - 1 mediates infection has prompted research into the development of therapeutic interventions to block CCR5 function . A number of new experimental HIV drugs , called CCR5 receptor antagonists , have been designed to interfere with the associative binding between the Gp120 envelope protein and the HIV co-receptor CCR5 . These experimental drugs include PRO140 ( CytoDyn ) , Vicriviroc ( Phase III trials were cancelled in July 2010 ) ( Schering Plough ) , Aplaviroc ( GW - 873140 ) ( GlaxoSmithKline ) and Maraviroc ( UK - 427857 ) ( Pfizer ) . Maraviroc was approved for use by the FDA in August 2007 . It is the only one thus far approved by the FDA for clinical use , thus becoming the first CCR5 inhibitor . A problem of this approach is that , while CCR5 is the major co-receptor by which HIV infects cells , it is not the only such co-receptor . It is possible that under selective pressure HIV will evolve to use another co-receptor . However , examination of viral resistance to AD101 , molecular antagonist of CCR5 , indicated that resistant viruses did not switch to another coreceptor ( CXCR4 ) but persisted in using CCR5 , either through binding to alternative domains of CCR5 , or by binding to the receptor at a higher affinity . However , because there is still another co-receptor available , this indicates that lacking the CCR5 gene does n't make one immune to the virus ; it simply implies that it would be more challenging for the individual to contract it . Also , the virus still has access to the CD4 . Unlike CCR5 , which the body apparently does n't really need due to those still living healthy lives even with the lack of \/ or absence of the gene ( as a result of the delta 32 mutation ) , CD4 is critical in the body 's defense system ( fighting against infection ) .","title":"CCR5","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"854758282_18002-18354-0-352","score":53.613586,"text":"Chickenpox\nVaricella can be lethal to adults with impaired immunity .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

Somewhat overlapping , but mainly following the incubation period , there is a period of communicability -- a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal .

Its contents are unknown . It was not submitted formally and there is no mention of it in the Society 's records . Jenner had sent the paper informally to Sir Joseph Banks , the Society 's president , who asked Everard Home for his views . His report , published for the first time in 1999 , was sceptical and called for further vaccinations . These were done and in 1798 Jenner published an analysis of 23 ' cases ' including several individuals who had resisted natural exposure after previous cowpox . It is not known how many Jenner vaccinated or challenged by inoculation with smallpox virus ; e.g. Case 21 included ' several children and adults ' . Crucially all of at least four who Jenner deliberately inoculated with smallpox virus resisted it . These included the first and last patients in a series of arm - to - arm transfers . He concluded that cowpox inoculation was a safe alternative to smallpox inoculation , but rashly claimed that the protective effect was lifelong . This last proved to be incorrect . Jenner also tried to distinguish between ' True ' cowpox which produced the desired result and ' Spurious ' cowpox which was ineffective and \/ or produced severe reaction . Modern research suggests Jenner was trying to distinguish between effects caused by what would now be recognised as noninfectious vaccine , a different virus ( e.g. paravaccinia \/ milker 's nodes ) , or contaminating bacterial pathogens . This caused confusion at the time , but would become important criteria in vaccine development . A further source of confusion was Jenner 's belief that fully effective vaccine obtained from cows originated in an equine disease , which he mistakenly referred to as grease . This was criticised at the time but vaccines derived from horsepox were soon introduced and later contributed to the complicated problem of the origin of vaccinia virus , the virus in present - day vaccine .","title":"Smallpox vaccine","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"722409356_42902-44617-0-1715","score":77.31985,"text":"Descriptive psychology\n`` I would suggest that the spiritual domain is anchored in these notions ( i.e. , ultimates , totalities , and boundary conditions ) .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Superior German aircraft , aided by ongoing introduction of design and technology innovations , allowed the German armies to overrun Western Europe with great speed in 1940 , largely assisted by lack of Allied aircraft , which in any case lagged in design and technical development during the slump in research investment after the Great Depression . Since the end of World War I , the French Air Force had been badly neglected , as military leaders preferred to spend money on ground armies and static fortifications to fight another World War I - style war . As a result , by 1940 , the French Air Force had only 1562 planes and was together with 1070 RAF planes facing 5,638 Luftwaffe fighters and fighter - bombers . Most French airfields were located in north - east France , and were quickly overrun in the early stages of the campaign . The Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom possessed some very advanced fighter planes , such as Spitfires and Hurricanes , but these were not useful for attacking ground troops on a battlefield , and the small number of planes dispatched to France with the British Expeditionary Force were destroyed fairly quickly . Subsequently , the Luftwaffe was able to achieve air superiority over France in 1940 , giving the German military an immense advantage in terms of reconnaissance and intelligence .","title":"Technology during World War II","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"823165070_31801-32359-0-558","score":53.99996,"text":"Carburetor\nThe fuel and air mixture is too rich when it has an excess of fuel , and too lean when there is not enough .

The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games . The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme . These criteria are history and tradition of the sport , universality , popularity of the sport , image , athletes ' health , development of the International Federation that governs the sport , and costs of holding the sport . From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics : golf , karate , rugby union , roller sports and squash . These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005 . Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists : karate and squash . Neither sport attained the required two - thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme .

Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses . The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America . A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 .

Michael , though , ended up being appreciative of Toby 's efforts to actually help him during their Sabre - mandated counseling sessions ( even if he spent much of the time hurling harsh statements at the HR rep ) , to the point where he decided to talk to Toby instead of simply signing off on a few corrected forms at the sessions ' end . While in `` Take Your Daughter to Work Day , '' Michael ends up bonding with Toby 's daughter Sasha when the employees bring their children into the office . However , later on , Michael becomes withdrawn and sad that he has n't had any children , which Toby senses and ends up being confidant to Michael . Michael inquires about being Sasha 's godfather . Toby simply tells him that she already has one . Michael has on a few occasions realized when his mistreatment of Toby has gone too far such as in `` Women 's Appreciation '' in which he literally asked him to expose his genitals and also in `` Frame Toby '' after attempting to get Toby arrested and fired , possibly showing that Michael 's hatred of Toby has limits .","title":"Toby Flenderson","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"822159927_57880-58283-0-403","score":23.847872,"text":"Toby Flenderson\nIn `` Counseling '' , Toby does counselling for Michael .

This occurs again notably in `` Classy Christmas '' where Michael himself vandalizes Holly 's Woody doll ( A gift from her boyfriend ) and tries to convince her Toby did it , though Toby fights back , denies it and says the vandalism is something Michael would do .

Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula , formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River . ( McNary Dam is not part of the Lower Snake River Project . ) Above Lower Granite Dam , the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar , just below Hells Canyon , is also maintained for jet - boats as this section is too rugged for ships . These dams have been proposed for removal , and if they were to be removed , it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States . The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries .

In 1780 , Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter , a device used to measure heat production . The heat from the guinea pig 's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter , showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion , similar to a candle burning . Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century , through the experiments of Louis Pasteur , \u00c9mile Roux , and Robert Koch . Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times , first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9 , 1961 -- with a successful recovery .

However , Slant 's Eric Henderson dismissed its unrealistic lyrics , while AllMusic 's Tim Sendra thought the song was `` over-the - top '' -- one of the weaker ones on the album . Spencer Hawk from Little Village criticized the song by calling it `` fairly innovative '' and notice that the shouting of the lyrics `` does n't feel genuine '' , however he felt that `` It 's very safe while being a little risky , and Mars is a solid singer '' . Music-News.com , reviewer David Spencer , stated `` great pop but little in way of surprise '' .","title":"Grenade (song)","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.3333333333,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.1412669729}}

Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible .

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure .

During the 1933 defence of the Great Wall , inadequately - equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of Japanese troops for several months . Using the cover of the Great Wall , the Chinese -- who were at times only armed with broadswords -- were able to beat off a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment . With the Chinese forces eventually overrun , the subsequent Tanggu Truce stipulated that the Great Wall was to become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo . Even so , the determined defence of the Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness of the Chinese people . The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked up this symbol in his poetry during his `` Long March '' escaping from Kuomintang prosecution . Near the end of the trek in 1935 , Mao wrote the poem `` Mount Liupan '' that contains the well - known line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present day : `` Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men '' ( \u4e0d \u5230 \u957f\u57ce \u975e \u597d\u6c49 ) .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice . The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom 's 1845 China , in a series of views .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_7770-9663-0-1893","score":72.34035,"text":"Great Wall of China\nKing Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty ( `` Qin Shi Huang '' ) in 221 BC . Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords , he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states . To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border . Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult , so builders always tried to use local resources . Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season .

Friends gather together in `` expectant waiting upon God '' to experience his still small voice leading them from within . There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed , and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services . Friends believe that God plans what will happen , with his spirit leading people to speak . When a participant feels led to speak , he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ( `` vocal ministry '' ) in front of others . When this happens , Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker . After someone has spoken , it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said , before further vocal ministry is given . Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent , sometimes many speak . These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox 's day . Modern meetings are often limited to an hour , ending when two people ( usually the elders ) exchange the sign of peace by handshake . This handshake is often shared by the others . This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain , Ireland , the continent of Europe , Australia , New Zealand , Southern Africa , Canada , and parts of the United States ( particularly yearly meetings associated with Friends General Conference and Beanite Quakerism ) -- constituting about 11 % of Quakers . Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing the light of God directly . Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so . Traditionally , Recorded Ministers were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry . This religious practice continues among Conservative Friends and Liberal Friends ( e.g. New York Yearly Meeting ) . Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice . London Yearly Meeting of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of Recorded Ministers in 1924 .","title":"Quakers","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"830988320_12036-13221-0-1185","score":45.07466,"text":"I Am Woman\nReddy had been quoted as saying , `` To this day I get mail from women who say , I went to law school because of your song .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel . '' Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position . The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends . '' Ultimately , Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes , two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired , thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show , becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25 .","title":"Rachel Green","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834324633_51225-51615-0-390","score":88.819046,"text":"Friends\nVox stated that Friends impacted the creation of other conflictless `` hangout sitcoms '' , with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits .

Friends gather together in `` expectant waiting upon God '' to experience his still small voice leading them from within . There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed , and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services . Friends believe that God plans what will happen , with his spirit leading people to speak . When a participant feels led to speak , he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ( `` vocal ministry '' ) in front of others . When this happens , Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker . After someone has spoken , it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said , before further vocal ministry is given . Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent , sometimes many speak . These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox 's day . Modern meetings are often limited to an hour , ending when two people ( usually the elders ) exchange the sign of peace by handshake . This handshake is often shared by the others . This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain , Ireland , the continent of Europe , Australia , New Zealand , Southern Africa , Canada , and parts of the United States ( particularly yearly meetings associated with Friends General Conference and Beanite Quakerism ) -- constituting about 11 % of Quakers . Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing the light of God directly . Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so . Traditionally , Recorded Ministers were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry . This religious practice continues among Conservative Friends and Liberal Friends ( e.g. New York Yearly Meeting ) . Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice . London Yearly Meeting of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of Recorded Ministers in 1924 .","title":"Quakers","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834324633_38245-38608-0-363","score":82.71058,"text":"Friends\nIt may have been impossible for any one episode to live up to the hype and expectations built up around the Friends finale , but this hour probably came as close as fans could have reasonably hoped .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel . '' Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position . The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends . '' Ultimately , Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes , two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired , thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show , becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25 .","title":"Rachel Green","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"804834770_54594-58520-992-2224","score":118.53795,"text":"Italian language\n( general ) \/ \u02ccbw\u0254na for\u02c8tu\u02d0na \/ I love you Ti amo ( between lovers only ) \/ Ti voglio bene ( in the sense of `` I am fond of you '' , between lovers , friends , relatives etc . ) \/ ti \u02ccv\u0254\u028e\u028eo \u02c8b\u025b\u02d0ne \/ ; \/ ti \u02c8a\u02d0mo \/ Welcome ( to ... ) Benvenuto \/ - i ( for male \/ males or mixed ) \/ Benvenuta \/ - e ( for female \/ females ) ( a \/ in ... ) \/ be\u0271ve\u02c8nu\u02d0to \/ Please Per favore \/ Per piacere \/ Per cortesia ( listen ) \/ per fa\u02c8vo\u02d0re \/ \/ per pja\u02c8t\u0283e\u02d0re \/ \/ per korte\u02c8zi\u02d0a \/ Thank you !

Shakespeare took advantage of this popularity : The Merchant of Venice , Much Ado About Nothing , All 's Well That Ends Well , Measure for Measure , and Romeo and Juliet are all from Italian novelle . Romeo and Juliet is a dramatisation of Brooke 's translation , and Shakespeare follows the poem closely but adds extra detail to both major and minor characters ( in particular the Nurse and Mercutio ) .","title":"Romeo and Juliet","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.3868528072,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3868528072}}

Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature ( with Macbeth , Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world 's greatest plays ) , and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language . Specifically , in plays like Hamlet , Shakespeare `` integrated characterization with plot , '' such that if the main character was different in any way , the plot would be totally changed . In Romeo and Juliet , Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre ( previous to Shakespeare , romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy ) . Through his soliloquies , Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character 's inner motivations and conflict ( up until Shakespeare , soliloquies were often used by playwrights to `` introduce ( characters ) , convey information , provide an exposition or reveal plans '' ) .","title":"Shakespeare's influence","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"806376271_57226-57939-0-713","score":63.58699,"text":"Romeo and Juliet\nRomeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare 's most - illustrated works .

North Carolina back country Scots and former Regulators joined forces in early 1776 , but they were broken as a force at the Battle of Moore 's Creek Bridge .","title":"Loyalist (American Revolution)","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.2,"recall_5":0.2,"recall_10":0.2,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.296081911,"ndcg_cut_5":0.2139862647,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2139862647}}

Because the city lies along the ocean and parallel to the predominant westerly winds , sideshore and light onshore breezes moderate temperatures resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places farther inland . In the winter , storms reach California , some of which bring heavy rainfall but the rainshadow effect of the coastal mountains can at times moderate or enhance the rainfall depending on local storm wind flows . Local rainfall totals can be enhanced by orographic lift when storms are accompanied by southerly flow pushing moist air over the Santa Ynez mountains , producing greater rainfall than in other coastal areas . Summers in Southern California are mostly rainless due to the presence of a high - pressure area over the eastern Pacific , but summer showers can happen due to tropical hurricane \/ Monsoonal flows that rarely reach Santa Barbara . In the fall , afternoon or evening downslope winds , locally called `` Sundowners '' , can raise temperatures into the high 90s and drop humidities into the single digits , increasing the chance due to downed powerlines etc. and severity of wildfires in the foothills north of the city . Annual rainfall totals are highly variable and in exceptional years like 1940 -- 1941 and 1997 -- 1998 over 40 inches ( 1.0 m ) of rain have fallen in a year , but in dry seasons less than 6 inches ( 150 mm ) is not unheard of .

The American historian Louise Young described Japan from September 1931 to the spring of 1933 as gripped by `` war fever '' as the conquest of Manchuria proved to be an extremely popular war . The metaphor of a `` lifeline '' suggested that Manchuria was crucial to the functioning of the Japanese economy , which explains why the conquest of Manchuria was so popular and why afterwards Japanese public opinion was so hostile towards any suggestion of letting Manchuria go . At the time , censorship in Japan was nowhere near as stringent as it later became , and Young noted : `` Had they wished , it would have been possible in 1931 and 1932 for journalists and editors to express anti-war sentiments '' . The liberal journal Kaiz\u014d criticized the war with the journalist Got\u014d Shinobu in the November 1931 edition accusing the Kwangtung Army of a `` two-fold coup d'\u00e9tat '' against both the government in Tokyo and against the government of China .

Japan 's most famous pacifist , the poet Akiko Yosano had caused a sensation in 1904 with her anti-war poem `` Brother Do Not Give Your Life '' , addressed to her younger brother serving in the Imperial Army that called the war with Russia stupid and senseless . Such was the extent of `` war fever '' in Japan in 1931 that even Akiko succumbed , writing a poem in 1932 praising bushid\u014d , urging the Kwantung Army to `` smash the sissified dreams of compromise '' and declared that to die for the Emperor in battle was the most `` purest '' act a Japanese man could perform .","title":"Japanese invasion of Manchuria","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"853990421_12257-12789-0-532","score":36.843872,"text":"Oil drop experiment\nWhy did n't they discover the new number was higher right away ?
