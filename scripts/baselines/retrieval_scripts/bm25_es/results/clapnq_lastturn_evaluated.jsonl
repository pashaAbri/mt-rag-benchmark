The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end - of - season World Championship Game between the two league champions ( later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game ) .

The monopoly that would be created needed to be legitimized by an act of Congress . In 1970 , the leagues fully merged under the name National Football League and divided into two conferences of an equal number of teams . Since the pre-merger NFL had six more teams than the AFL , three NFL teams -- the Pittsburgh Steelers , Cleveland Browns , and Baltimore Colts -- moved to the AFC , the conference containing the AFL teams .

Originally , the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys , which resulted in Dallas donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys , there have been six ( 6 ) exceptions : the Dallas Cowboys during Super Bowl XIII and XXVII , the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII , the Pittsburgh Steelers during Super Bowl XL , the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl 50 , and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII . The Cowboys , since 1964 , have worn white jerseys at home . The Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992 , continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000 , then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007 . Meanwhile , the Steelers , who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL -- NFL merger in 1970 , opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road , wearing white . The Steelers ' decision was compared with the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX ; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season , but after winning road playoff games against the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins wearing red jerseys , New England opted to switch to crimson for the Super Bowl as the designated home team . For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50 , Denver general manager John Elway simply stated , `` We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms '' ; they previously had been 0 -- 4 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys . The Broncos ' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition , losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion . It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII . During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady , New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games , but have worn white for a home game in the 2008 , 2010 , and 2011 seasons .

Even today he is remembered as the man who united India . He is , in this regard , compared to Otto von Bismarck of Germany , who did the same thing in the 1860s . Under the plan of 3 June , more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan , or choosing independence . Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede , most of the people and territory would be fragmented . The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion . Gandhi had said to Patel , `` ( T ) he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it '' . Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task . He asked V. P. Menon , a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India , to become his right - hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry . On 6 May 1947 , Patel began lobbying the princes , attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts . Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs , inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi . At these meetings , Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order . Patel invoked the patriotism of India 's monarchs , asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people . He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic , especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects . He proposed favourable terms for the merger , including the creation of privy purses for the rulers ' descendants . While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism , Patel did not rule out force . Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith , he set a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document .

Once released , Patel served as interim Congress president , but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Mumbai . After the signing of the Gandhi -- Irwin Pact , Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi -- here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties . It advocated the establishment of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat . Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London , Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened , and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail . During this term of imprisonment , Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other , and the two developed a close bond of affection , trust , and frankness . Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother ( Gandhi ) and his younger brother ( Patel ) . Despite having arguments with Gandhi , Patel respected his instincts and leadership . In prison , the two discussed national and social issues , read Hindu epics , and cracked jokes . Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit . Gandhi 's secretary , Mahadev Desai , kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel .

Its contents are unknown . It was not submitted formally and there is no mention of it in the Society 's records . Jenner had sent the paper informally to Sir Joseph Banks , the Society 's president , who asked Everard Home for his views . His report , published for the first time in 1999 , was sceptical and called for further vaccinations . These were done and in 1798 Jenner published an analysis of 23 ' cases ' including several individuals who had resisted natural exposure after previous cowpox . It is not known how many Jenner vaccinated or challenged by inoculation with smallpox virus ; e.g. Case 21 included ' several children and adults ' . Crucially all of at least four who Jenner deliberately inoculated with smallpox virus resisted it . These included the first and last patients in a series of arm - to - arm transfers . He concluded that cowpox inoculation was a safe alternative to smallpox inoculation , but rashly claimed that the protective effect was lifelong . This last proved to be incorrect . Jenner also tried to distinguish between ' True ' cowpox which produced the desired result and ' Spurious ' cowpox which was ineffective and \/ or produced severe reaction . Modern research suggests Jenner was trying to distinguish between effects caused by what would now be recognised as noninfectious vaccine , a different virus ( e.g. paravaccinia \/ milker 's nodes ) , or contaminating bacterial pathogens . This caused confusion at the time , but would become important criteria in vaccine development . A further source of confusion was Jenner 's belief that fully effective vaccine obtained from cows originated in an equine disease , which he mistakenly referred to as grease . This was criticised at the time but vaccines derived from horsepox were soon introduced and later contributed to the complicated problem of the origin of vaccinia virus , the virus in present - day vaccine .","title":"Smallpox vaccine","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"807235113_77543-78571-0-1028","score":21.918495,"text":"Health care in the United States\nOn June 30 , 2006 , an FDA ruling went into effect extending protection from lawsuits to pharmaceutical manufacturers , even if it was found that they submitted fraudulent clinical trial data to the FDA in their quest for approval .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs . Other antiviral drugs in use target different stages of the viral life cycle .

Knowledge of the mechanism by which this strain of HIV - 1 mediates infection has prompted research into the development of therapeutic interventions to block CCR5 function . A number of new experimental HIV drugs , called CCR5 receptor antagonists , have been designed to interfere with the associative binding between the Gp120 envelope protein and the HIV co-receptor CCR5 . These experimental drugs include PRO140 ( CytoDyn ) , Vicriviroc ( Phase III trials were cancelled in July 2010 ) ( Schering Plough ) , Aplaviroc ( GW - 873140 ) ( GlaxoSmithKline ) and Maraviroc ( UK - 427857 ) ( Pfizer ) . Maraviroc was approved for use by the FDA in August 2007 . It is the only one thus far approved by the FDA for clinical use , thus becoming the first CCR5 inhibitor . A problem of this approach is that , while CCR5 is the major co-receptor by which HIV infects cells , it is not the only such co-receptor . It is possible that under selective pressure HIV will evolve to use another co-receptor . However , examination of viral resistance to AD101 , molecular antagonist of CCR5 , indicated that resistant viruses did not switch to another coreceptor ( CXCR4 ) but persisted in using CCR5 , either through binding to alternative domains of CCR5 , or by binding to the receptor at a higher affinity . However , because there is still another co-receptor available , this indicates that lacking the CCR5 gene does n't make one immune to the virus ; it simply implies that it would be more challenging for the individual to contract it . Also , the virus still has access to the CD4 . Unlike CCR5 , which the body apparently does n't really need due to those still living healthy lives even with the lack of \/ or absence of the gene ( as a result of the delta 32 mutation ) , CD4 is critical in the body 's defense system ( fighting against infection ) .","title":"CCR5","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"798813276_43198-43866-0-668","score":15.146553,"text":"Human rights and development\nThis sixth MDG is to combat HIV \/ AIDS , malaria and other diseases .

Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses . Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity ( illness ) and mortality ( death ) associated with viral infections such as polio , measles , mumps and rubella . Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live - attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated .

Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted . It is important to find the source , or sources , of the outbreak and to identify the virus . Once the virus has been identified , the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines . When vaccines are not available , sanitation and disinfection can be effective . Often , infected people are isolated from the rest of the community , and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine . To control the outbreak of foot - and - mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001 , thousands of cattle were slaughtered . Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms . Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks , but are known for most infections . Somewhat overlapping , but mainly following the incubation period , there is a period of communicability -- a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal . This , too , is known for many viral infections , and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks . When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population , community , or region , they are called epidemics .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

The game does not feature a morality system , but instead has situations that give players some freedom of choice . The consequences of some of these choices were deliberately made unclear in an attempt to make them more realistic , encouraging players to explore the other potential options not directly presented by the game . These choices were inspired by Fallout 3 , and are often between : `` what the character knows and what the player would maybe try and do '' . To make choices more realistic , and to increase the impact of the story , the team put in a lot of morally ambiguous choices and `` bad or worse '' decisions . Williams added that absolute good choices are not practical and sometimes may not exist in real - world situations , so to reflect that combat sequences sometimes force players to make split - second decisions and accept whatever the consequences are . According to Williams , this is something that people frequently do in real - world scenarios , and they must `` live with it '' after their decision . Williams added that they hoped that the game 's players would have different feelings after making these choices , as this would show that they had created an opportunity for players to examine their own inner emotions , and that they had successfully provided different experiences for players without having a branching storyline .

Superior German aircraft , aided by ongoing introduction of design and technology innovations , allowed the German armies to overrun Western Europe with great speed in 1940 , largely assisted by lack of Allied aircraft , which in any case lagged in design and technical development during the slump in research investment after the Great Depression . Since the end of World War I , the French Air Force had been badly neglected , as military leaders preferred to spend money on ground armies and static fortifications to fight another World War I - style war . As a result , by 1940 , the French Air Force had only 1562 planes and was together with 1070 RAF planes facing 5,638 Luftwaffe fighters and fighter - bombers . Most French airfields were located in north - east France , and were quickly overrun in the early stages of the campaign . The Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom possessed some very advanced fighter planes , such as Spitfires and Hurricanes , but these were not useful for attacking ground troops on a battlefield , and the small number of planes dispatched to France with the British Expeditionary Force were destroyed fairly quickly . Subsequently , the Luftwaffe was able to achieve air superiority over France in 1940 , giving the German military an immense advantage in terms of reconnaissance and intelligence .","title":"Technology during World War II","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"829923870_15878-16191-0-313","score":15.470619,"text":"Technology during World War II\nSignificantly , the bomber offensive kept the revolutionary Type XXI U-Boat from entering service during the war .

The Navy called for more fighters , and more warning , which meant combat air patrols circling the big ships , more radar picket ships ( which themselves became prime targets ) , and more attacks on airbases and gasoline supplies . Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945 , because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home islands . The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and obsolete planes , and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there was no return trip , the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched further . Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all the way to the target , the proportion of hits was much higher than in ordinary bombing .

Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists : karate and squash .

The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

Food that is both abundant and easily obtained is preferred . Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits . Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity . In spring , winter - provided carrion , grasses , shoots , sedges and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears from almost every part of their distribution . Fruits , including berries , become increasingly important during summer and early autumn . Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E.

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird . The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England , which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall , an Elizabethan manor house in Essex , and dated to around 1575 .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"722409356_42902-44617-0-1715","score":28.402365,"text":"Descriptive psychology\n`` I would suggest that the spiritual domain is anchored in these notions ( i.e. , ultimates , totalities , and boundary conditions ) .

He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters ' have against superhero films ; the lack of a targeted campaign for the awards by Fox , who did not seem to be expecting any of the film 's previous awards either ; and the large amount of other films in contention , as `` 2016 was , all in all , a pretty good year for movies '' .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

In the 19th century , Max M\u00fcller noted that what is called ancient religion today , would have been called `` law '' in antiquity . For example , there is no precise equivalent of `` religion '' in Hebrew , and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious , national , racial , or ethnic identities . The Sanskrit word `` dharma '' , sometimes translated as `` religion '' , also means law or duty . Throughout classical South Asia , the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions . Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between `` imperial law '' and universal or `` Buddha law '' , but these later became independent sources of power . Throughout its long history , Japan had no concept of `` religion '' since there was no corresponding Japanese word , nor anything close to its meaning , but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding , among other things , freedom of religion , the country had to contend with this Western idea .","title":"Relationship between religion and science","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"849311646_38905-39563-0-658","score":13.944733,"text":"The Gambia\nIt is unclear to what extent indigenous beliefs , such as the Serer religion , continue to be practiced .

The intellectual interest of Classic - era authors , such as Thucydides and Plato , was limited to their utility as `` a way of talking about human life rather than a description or a truth '' , because , if the gods remain religious figures , rather than human metaphors , their `` existence '' -- without the foundation of either dogma or a bible of faiths -- then allowed Greek culture the intellectual breadth and freedom to conjure gods fitting any religious function they required as a people . The religion had no founder and was not the creation of an inspired teacher which were popular origins of existing religions in the world . The individuals were free to believe what they wanted , as the Greek religion was created out of a consensus of the people . These beliefs coincide to the thoughts about the gods in polytheistic Greek religion . In the article `` Greek Religion '' A.W.H. Adkins , agrees with this by saying , `` The early Greeks personalized every aspect of their world , natural and cultural , and their experiences in it . The earth , the sea , the mountains , the rivers , custom - law ( themis ) , and one 's share in society and its goods were all seen in personal as well as naturalistic terms . '' As a result of this thinking , each god or goddess in Polytheistic Greek religion is attributed to an aspect of the human world . For example , Poseidon is the god of the sea , Aphrodite is the goddess of beauty , Ares is the god of war , and so on and so forth for many other gods . This is how Greek culture was defined as many Athenians felt the presence of their gods through divine intervention in significant events in their lives .

Given the presence of the upstream spring creeks for spawning , this reach of fast water is ideal habitat for rainbows which make up most of the population here . The use of a drift boat is the best way to access this stretch , though there are some good access points for walking and wading as well . Highway 89 Bridge to Big Timber This section starts about five miles to the east of Livingston , just off Interstate 90 , where Highway 89 turns north , toward White Sulphur Springs . This lower river , from here on down through Big Timber is similar to the water around Livingston , but the riffles and pools are farther apart so there is more unproductive water .

Traditionally , the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands , but since the 1960s , it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people . It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia , particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands ; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador ( mainly in the Sierra ) and Colombia . Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly , they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals , such as pigs and cattle ; moreover , they can be raised in an urban environment . Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income , and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large - scale municipal fairs . Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol , and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken . The animal may be served fried ( chactado or frito ) , broiled ( asado ) , or roasted ( al horno ) , and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee .

This step is important for later glycosylation and the formation of the triple helix structure of collagen . Because the hydroxylase enzymes that perform these reactions require vitamin C as a cofactor , a long - term deficiency in this vitamin results in impaired collagen synthesis and scurvy . These hydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by two different enzymes : prolyl - 4 - hydroxylase and lysyl - hydroxylase . Vitamin C also serves with them in inducing these reactions .

In `` eolian deflation '' , the wind continually removes fine - grained material , which becomes wind - blown sand . This exposes coarser - grained material , mainly pebbles with some larger stones or cobbles , leaving a desert pavement , an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a tessellated mosaic . Different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed . It may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones jiggle themselves into place ; alternatively , stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface .

Discharge of untreated sewage is the single most important cause for pollution of surface and ground water in India . There is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic waste water in India . The problem is not only that India lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained . The majority of the government - owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants , together with absentee employees and poor management .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836413300_21439-22869-0-1430","score":21.48705,"text":"Infertility\nInfertility rates have increased by 4 % since the 1980s , mostly from problems with fecundity due to an increase in age .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836413300_4317-4515-0-198","score":17.942099,"text":"Infertility\nOne definition of infertility that is frequently used in the United States by reproductive endocrinologists , doctors who specialize in infertility , to consider a couple eligible for treatment is :","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836413300_446-1385-0-939","score":17.693367,"text":"Infertility\nIn humans , infertility is the inability to become pregnant or carry a pregnancy to full term .

Guessing , inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying . From abduction , Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring , on the basis of tests , the proportion of truth in the hypothesis . Every inquiry , whether into ideas , brute facts , or norms and laws , arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms ( and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway ) . All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction , which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple , economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon . Oftenest , even a well - prepared mind guesses wrong . But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent , especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense , said Peirce , of the `` facile and natural '' , as by Galileo 's natural light of reason and as distinct from `` logical simplicity '' . Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference . Its general rationale is inductive : it succeeds often enough and , without it , there is no hope of sufficiently expediting inquiry ( often multi-generational ) toward new truths . Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself . Peirce calls his pragmatism `` the logic of abduction '' . His pragmatic maxim is : `` Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have . Then , your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object '' .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice . The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom 's 1845 China , in a series of views .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_70927-71796-0-869","score":22.753033,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nWestern scholarship of the Great Wall was , until recently , affected by misconceptions derived from traditional accounts of the Wall . When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West , European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial `` Great Wall '' in his Travels . Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall . Thus , Father Martino Martini 's mistaken claim that the Wall had `` lasted right up to the present time without injury or destruction '' since the time of Qin was accepted as fact by the 18th - century philosophes .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.25,"recall_3":0.25,"recall_5":0.25,"recall_10":0.25,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.39038005,"ndcg_cut_10":0.39038005}}

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border . Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult , so builders always tried to use local resources . Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.2,"recall_5":0.2,"recall_10":0.8,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.296081911,"ndcg_cut_5":0.2139862647,"ndcg_cut_10":0.545890255}}

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel .

The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends .

He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other .

The climate of the Salt Lake City area is generally subhumid , not semi-arid as often claimed . Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification , Salt Lake City has a hot - summer humid continental climate ( Dfa ) , with relatively drier summers than the rest of the year . The Pacific Ocean is the primary influence on the weather , contributing storms from about October to May , with spring being the wettest season . Snow falls frequently during the winter , contributed largely by the lake - effect from the Great Salt Lake . The only source of precipitation in the summer is monsoon moisture moving north from the Gulf of California . Summers are hot , frequently reaching above 100 \u00b0 F ( 38 \u00b0 C ) , while winters are cold and snowy .

This was preceded by the founding of the Turkish Petroleum Company , which was created with the intention of exploring and extracting oil within the Ottoman Empire . Eventually , after the discovery of a large oil field in Iraq in 1928 , the issue of distribution arose . Each of the large powers -- France , the United Kingdom , and the United States -- worried about being edged out by the other two . The Red Line Agreement was eventually signed , giving the Near East Development Corporation , the Anglo - Persian Oil Company , Royal Dutch \/ Shell , and the Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles each 23.75 % of any oil that was produced by the Turkish Petroleum Company . The Near East Development Corporation represented American interests and included Jersey Standard Oil , Socony - Vacuum Oil Company , Gulf Oil , the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company , and Atlantic Refining . The remaining 5 % share went to an Armenian businessman , Calouste Gulbenkian , who had previously owned shares within TPC . The more important provision of the Red Line Agreement was that none of the four parties could develop any oilfields from the Suez Canal to the Iran , with the exception of Kuwait ( the area that the TPC had jurisdiction over ) , unless that party gained support and approval from the other three . Thus , the United States broke into the oil market in Iraq and later into the rest of the Middle East . Eventually , due to the aligning of Prime Minister Rashid al - Gilani with Germany , the West , particularly Great Britain , gained open access to Iraq . However , WWII left the UK weakened and unable to retain its dominance in the region , and as such the Truman and Roosevelt administrations were able to achieve their top priority , monopolizing oil in the region .","title":"History of United States\u2013Middle East economic relations","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"818081208_52614-53136-0-522","score":17.43632,"text":"Surrender of Japan\nI have listened carefully to each of the arguments presented in opposition to the view that Japan should accept the Allied reply as it stands and without further clarification or modification , but my own thoughts have not undergone any change ...
