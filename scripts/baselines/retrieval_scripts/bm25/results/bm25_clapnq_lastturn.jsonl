Patel 's arrest and Gandhi 's subsequent arrest caused the Salt Satyagraha to greatly intensify in Gujarat -- districts across Gujarat launched an anti-tax rebellion until and unless Patel and Gandhi were released . Once released , Patel served as interim Congress president , but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Mumbai . After the signing of the Gandhi -- Irwin Pact , Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi -- here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties . It advocated the establishment of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat . Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London , Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened , and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail . During this term of imprisonment , Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other , and the two developed a close bond of affection , trust , and frankness . Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother ( Gandhi ) and his younger brother ( Patel ) . Despite having arguments with Gandhi , Patel respected his instincts and leadership . In prison , the two discussed national and social issues , read Hindu epics , and cracked jokes . Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit . Gandhi 's secretary , Mahadev Desai , kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel . When Gandhi embarked on a fast - unto - death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables , Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food .

Even today he is remembered as the man who united India . He is , in this regard , compared to Otto von Bismarck of Germany , who did the same thing in the 1860s . Under the plan of 3 June , more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan , or choosing independence . Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede , most of the people and territory would be fragmented . The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion . Gandhi had said to Patel , `` ( T ) he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it '' . Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task . He asked V. P. Menon , a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India , to become his right - hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry . On 6 May 1947 , Patel began lobbying the princes , attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts . Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs , inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi . At these meetings , Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order . Patel invoked the patriotism of India 's monarchs , asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people . He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic , especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects . He proposed favourable terms for the merger , including the creation of privy purses for the rulers ' descendants . While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism , Patel did not rule out force . Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith , he set a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document . All but three of the states willingly merged into the Indian union ; only Jammu and Kashmir , Junagadh , and Hyderabad did not fall into his basket .

The park service started trapping and moving the elk and , when that was not effective , killing them . Elk population control methods continued for more than 30 years .

At times , people would mention bringing wolves back to Yellowstone to help control the elk population . Yellowstone 's managers were not eager to bring back wolves , especially after so successfully extirpating them from the park . Elk control continued into the 1960s . In the late 1960s , local hunters began to complain to their congressmen that there were too few elk , and the congressmen threatened to stop funding Yellowstone . Killing elk was given up as control method which allowed elk populations to again rise . As elk populations rose , the quality of the range decreased affecting many other animals .

Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces , resulting in economies of scale . The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760 .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

Steve Trevor makes his first live - action theatrical appearance in Wonder Woman , portrayed by Chris Pine , who has signed on for a multi-picture deal . The film places Steve Trevor in the role of partner / love interest , as a fellow warrior , like he was portrayed in the original comics . This version of Trevor , a United States Army Air Service 94th Aero Squadron pilot with the American Expeditionary Forces , is a captain and an Allied spy in World War I who has stolen information from a weapons facility in the Ottoman Empire run by German general Erich Ludendorff , whose scientist Doctor Maru is producing a new , deadlier form of mustard gas . Diana goes with Steve to take part in the War , and he acts as her guide into the world outside of Themyscira and how mankind functions . The two grow closer along the way , but are conflicted when Steve is more focused on stopping Doctor Maru 's bombs and Diana thinks that killing Ares will stop the war . In the climax , Steve hijacks a German strategic bomber containing the gas and sacrifices himself to incinerate it at a safe distance , his last words being to tell Diana that he can save today while she could save the world and tells her that he loves her , leaving her with his father 's watch as a keepsake before he jumps onto the plane . His sacrifice leads Diana to believe that ultimately the world can only be saved through love , not hatred . In 2017 , Bruce Wayne retrieves the original group photo and his father 's watch and returns it to Diana , who sends him an email thanking him for bringing Steve back to her .

The seat is typically surrounded by a curtain of some sort to allow for some privacy and help avoid outside interference during the photo session .

Before each photograph , there will be an indication , such as a light or a buzzer , that will signal the patron to prepare their pose . After the last photograph in the series ( typically between 3 and 8 ) has been taken , the photo booth begins developing the film -- a process that used to take several minutes in the old `` wet chemistry '' booths , but is now typically accomplished in about 30 seconds with digital technology . The prints are then delivered to the customer . Typical dimensions of these prints vary .

The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . After a series of league mergers and folds , it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 .", "title": "Stanley Cup", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "807294979_70815-71424-0-609", "score": 26.77591681181759, "text": "Arizona\nCollege sports are also prevalent in Arizona .

Men often struggle with binge eating followed by excessive exercise while focusing on building muscle rather than losing fat , but this goal of gaining muscle is just as much an eating disorder as obsessing over thinness .

The German word for them is Meerschweinchen , literally `` little sea pig '' , which has been translated into Polish as \u015bwinka morska , into Hungarian as tengerimalac , and into Russian as \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 .

Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_33770-34412-0-642", "score": 32.56618655646302, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe Fairy Caravan , a novel by Beatrix Potter , and Michael Bond 's Olga da Polga series for children , both feature guinea pigs as the protagonist .

However , high - dose supplementation of pregnant women should be avoided because it can cause miscarriage and birth defects . Food fortification is also useful for improving VAD . A variety of oily and dry forms of the retinol esters , retinyl acetates and retinyl palmitate are available for food fortification of vitamin A. Margarine and oil are the ideal food vehicles for vitamin A fortification . They protect vitamin A from oxidation during storage and prompt absorption of vitamin A. Beta - carotene and retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate are used as a form of vitamin A for vitamin A fortification of fat - based foods . Fortification of sugar with retinyl palmitate as a form of vitamin A has been used extensively throughout Central America . Cereal flours , milk powder , and liquid milk are also used as food vehicles for vitamin A fortification . Genetic engineering is another method of food fortification , and this has been achieved with golden rice , but opposition to genetically modified foods has prevented its use as of July 2012 . Dietary diversification can also control VAD . Non-animal sources of vitamin A which contain pre-formed vitamin A account for greater than 80 % of intake for most individuals in the developing world . The increase in consumption of vitamin A-rich foods of animal origin in addition to fruits and vegetables has beneficial effects on VAD . Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service have been able to identify genetic sequences in corn that are associated with higher levels of beta - carotene , the precursor to vitamin A. They found that breeders can cross certain variations of corn to produce a crop with an 18-fold increase in beta - carotene .

According to this theory , the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power . Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups , such as an individual having superiority over another .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

The difference in neuroticism was the most prominent and consistent , with significant differences found in 49 of the 55 nations surveyed . Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous , healthy , and more gender - egalitarian cultures . A plausible explanation for this is that acts by women in individualistic , egalitarian countries are more likely to be attributed to their personality , rather than being attributed to ascribed gender roles within collectivist , traditional countries . Differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were due to differences between men , not women , in these respective regions . That is , men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic , extraverted , conscientious and agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions . Women , on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions . The most simple explanation for this gender data is that women remain relatively resource - poor , regardless of the circumstances of males within a first - world country . However , the authors of this study speculated that resource - poor environments ( that is , countries with low levels of development ) may inhibit the development of gender differences , whereas resource - rich environments facilitate them . This may be because males require more resources than females in order to reach their full developmental potential . The authors also argued that due to different evolutionary pressures , men may have evolved to be more risk taking and socially dominant , whereas women evolved to be more cautious and nurturing . Ancient hunter - gatherer societies may have been more egalitarian than later agriculturally oriented societies . Hence , the development of gender inequalities may have acted to constrain the development of gender differences in personality that originally evolved in hunter - gatherer societies . As modern societies have become more egalitarian , again , it may be that innate sex differences are no longer constrained and hence manifest more fully than in less - developed cultures . Currently , this hypothesis remains untested , as gender differences in modern societies have not been compared with those in hunter - gatherer societies .", "title": "Big Five personality traits", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "827733959_11072-11467-0-395", "score": 16.337160429770087, "text": "Bipolar junction transistor\nA BJT consists of three differently doped semiconductor regions : the emitter region , the base region and the collector region .

The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice . The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom 's 1845 China , in a series of views .", "title": "History of the Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801328598_17856-18820-0-960", "score": 30.82487880722485, "text": "History of the Great Wall of China\nWall configurations were changed to reflect the new borders under the Qin .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

The episode that would ultimately transform the friends ' relationship for the remainder of the series was the first - season finale `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' , in which Rachel finally learns of Ross ' true feelings for her , at the same time discovering she actually feels the same . However , the episode nearly went unwritten because , at the time , few Friends writers were expecting the couple 's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became . The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows ; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple 's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive `` he 's pining , she 's oblivious '' pattern , using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel . Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high , `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' became Friends ' most reworked episode . The couple 's first kiss at the end of season two 's `` The One Where Ross Finds Out '' was met with deafening applause from the studio audience . Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging . Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by `` dangl ( ing ) the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together . '' According to Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb , Ross and Rachel 's ever - changing relationship `` converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama .

Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories . Even in Shakespeare 's lifetime , it was extremely popular . Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare 's plays , in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London 's dominant playwright . The date of the first performance is unknown . The First Quarto , printed in 1597 , says that `` it hath been often ( and with great applause ) plaid publiquely '' , setting the first performance before that date . The Lord Chamberlain 's Men were certainly the first to perform it . Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare , the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors , Will Kemp , instead of Peter , in a line in Act Five . Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo , being the company 's actor , and Master Robert Goffe ( a boy ) the first Juliet . The premiere is likely to have been at `` The Theatre '' , with other early productions at `` The Curtain '' .

This was preceded by the founding of the Turkish Petroleum Company , which was created with the intention of exploring and extracting oil within the Ottoman Empire . Eventually , after the discovery of a large oil field in Iraq in 1928 , the issue of distribution arose . Each of the large powers -- France , the United Kingdom , and the United States -- worried about being edged out by the other two . The Red Line Agreement was eventually signed , giving the Near East Development Corporation , the Anglo - Persian Oil Company , Royal Dutch / Shell , and the Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles each 23.75 % of any oil that was produced by the Turkish Petroleum Company . The Near East Development Corporation represented American interests and included Jersey Standard Oil , Socony - Vacuum Oil Company , Gulf Oil , the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company , and Atlantic Refining . The remaining 5 % share went to an Armenian businessman , Calouste Gulbenkian , who had previously owned shares within TPC . The more important provision of the Red Line Agreement was that none of the four parties could develop any oilfields from the Suez Canal to the Iran , with the exception of Kuwait ( the area that the TPC had jurisdiction over ) , unless that party gained support and approval from the other three . Thus , the United States broke into the oil market in Iraq and later into the rest of the Middle East . Eventually , due to the aligning of Prime Minister Rashid al - Gilani with Germany , the West , particularly Great Britain , gained open access to Iraq .

Other events such as Benito Mussolini 's Italian Conquest of Ethiopia went ignored by the U.S. along with the League of Nations being unable to act upon the usage of chemical weapons by the Italian fascists .

This , along with Roosevelt 's Quarantine Speech , produced mixed opinions among Americans that were still anxious about military involvement .

Over this period , the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India , importing these from Britain 's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations , while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms , and of agricultural exports from India . Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade .

Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China . However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate .
