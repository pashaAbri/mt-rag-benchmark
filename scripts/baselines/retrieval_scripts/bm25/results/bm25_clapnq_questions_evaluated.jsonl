The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth , according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth . The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' .

When the moon travels completely into the Earth 's umbra , one observes a total lunar eclipse . The moon 's speed through the shadow is about one kilometer per second ( 2,300 mph ) , and totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes . Nevertheless , the total time between the moon 's first and last contact with the shadow is much longer and could last up to four hours . The relative distance of the moon from the Earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse 's duration . In particular , when the moon is near its apogee , the farthest point from the Earth in its orbit , its orbital speed is the slowest . The diameter of the umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the orbital distance of the moon .

He had been outraged by Jinnah 's Direct Action campaign , which had provoked communal violence across India , and by the viceroy 's vetoes of his home department 's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality . Patel severely criticised the viceroy 's induction of League ministers into the government , and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress 's approval . Although further outraged at the League 's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government , he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims , and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu - Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences . The continuation of a divided and weak central government would , in Patel 's mind , result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence . In December 1946 and January 1947 , Patel worked with civil servant V.P. Menon on the latter 's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim - majority provinces . Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition . Patel , a fierce critic of Jinnah 's demand that the Hindu - majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state , obtained the partition of those provinces , thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan . Patel 's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public , which had tired of the League 's tactics , but he was criticised by Gandhi , Nehru , secular Muslims , and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so . When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947 , Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal . Knowing Gandhi 's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition , Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over what he saw as the practical unworkability of any Congress -- League coalition , the rising violence , and the threat of civil war . At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal , Patel said :","title":"Vallabhbhai Patel","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832941564_14645-15187-0-542","score":19.7571080961,"text":"Quit India Movement\nHindu nationalist parties like the Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially .

But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing `` fullest peace '' for having done `` their duty '' . Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British had employed ruthless means of suppression , the Quit India movement was `` by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857 '' , as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill . More than 100,000 people were arrested and many were killed in violent struggles with the police . Strikes , protests , and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India .

He had been outraged by Jinnah 's Direct Action campaign , which had provoked communal violence across India , and by the viceroy 's vetoes of his home department 's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality . Patel severely criticised the viceroy 's induction of League ministers into the government , and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress 's approval . Although further outraged at the League 's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government , he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims , and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu - Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences . The continuation of a divided and weak central government would , in Patel 's mind , result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence . In December 1946 and January 1947 , Patel worked with civil servant V.P. Menon on the latter 's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim - majority provinces . Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition . Patel , a fierce critic of Jinnah 's demand that the Hindu - majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state , obtained the partition of those provinces , thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan . Patel 's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public , which had tired of the League 's tactics , but he was criticised by Gandhi , Nehru , secular Muslims , and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so . When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947 , Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal . Knowing Gandhi 's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition , Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over what he saw as the practical unworkability of any Congress -- League coalition , the rising violence , and the threat of civil war .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate .

The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War .

Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .

The classic and most familiar arrangement from the old style photo booths is four pictures on a strip about 40 mm wide by 205 mm long ; digital prints tend to have a square arrangement of two images above two images .","title":"Photo booth","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"825508981_7298-8029-0-731","score":16.2306820395,"text":"Photo booth\nPhoto booth rental companies allow a person to rent a photo booth for a short period of time ( usually in hours ) for a fee .

By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons . Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops , but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation . The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks . Marine pilots , like all aviators , fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority ; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops . On the other hand , the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own . Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces ; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield . The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards ahead . In 1944 , after considerable internal acrimony , Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out . At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party ( ALP ) not only requested air support , but actually directed it in tactical detail . The Marine formula increased responsiveness , reduced `` friendly '' casualties , and ( flying weather permitting ) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery . For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation , provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed - wing fighters or bombers , although the Army was allowed to have some unarmed transports and spotter planes .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America .

Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses . The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective .

This can happen if a player is either downed or goes out of bounds in the end zone while carrying the ball , or if he fumbles the ball , and it goes out of bounds in the end zone . A safety is also awarded to the defensive team if the offensive team commits a foul which is enforced in its own end zone . A safety is not awarded if a player intercepts a pass or receives a kick in his own end zone and is downed there . This situation , in which the opponent caused the ball to enter the end zone , is called a touchback ; no points are scored , and the team that gained possession of the ball is awarded possession at its own 20 - yard line . If the interception or reception occurs outside the end zone , and the player is carried into the end zone by momentum , the ball is placed at the spot of the catch and no safety is awarded . A safety is signaled by a referee holding both palms together above the head , fingertips pointing upwards . After a safety , the team that conceded the safety kicks a free kick ( which may be a punt , place kick , or drop kick ) from its 20 - yard line .","title":"American football rules","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"809042294_21919-22289-0-370","score":16.3822105745,"text":"Time Stands Still (Degrassi: The Next Generation)\nLater at their home , Ashley Kerwin , very upset about Jimmy being in the hospital , ends a conversation about Rick with , `` ... so who is this guy , if not some psycho ? !

Based on seven critiques , review aggregation website Metacritic gave the ninth season of the show a 64 out of 100 rating , which denotes `` generally favorable reviews '' . Entertainment website Holy Moly named the series one of the best shows during the 2012 -- 13 season , writing that `` this final season of The Office has been great '' largely due to the fact that `` every single relationship in the show rings true with the audience . '' Michael Tedder of Vulture commented that he was `` willing to call it the fourth best season of the show overall , which is by no means faint praise . '' He explained that this was largely due to the fact that the `` final season was a chance to see how everyone else would end up '' . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that `` the tension between Jim and Pam in the final season ended up being highly controversial for a number of reasons ... but it also provided the most hopeful moments of the series ' final stretch '' ( although he did note that it was clear that the writers had `` blatantly '' set up the drama ) . He concluded that the finale was able to successfully return the series `` to what had always been its heart -- to have true fulfillment '' . Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the season an 8.5 out of 10 , denoting a `` great '' year . She felt that the character growth in the final few episodes was particularly well executed , and the last stretch of the season helped raise it after a rocky start ; ultimately , she felt that the writers were able to craft the proper ending for the show . She was , however , critical of Andy 's characterization , noting that he was merely used as a plot device when convenient . Many critics argued that the season was an improvement , in both writing and humor , over the previous season .","title":"The Office (U.S. season 9)","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"822159927_1310-1603-0-293","score":15.6607329622,"text":"Toby Flenderson\nToby Flenderson , M.S.W.

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_7094-7305-0-211","score":33.1463487464,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2006 MLS All - Star Game August 5 , 2006 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 0 Chelsea ( show ) Toyota Park , Bridgeview , Illinois De Rosario 70 ' Report Attendance : 21,210 Referee : Abbey Okulaja MVP : Dwayne De Rosario MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_7327-7564-0-235","score":32.6064563874,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2007 MLS All - Star Game July 19 , 2007 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 0 Celtic ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado \u00c1ngel 36 ' Toja 44 ' Report Attendance : 18,661 Referee : Baldomero Toledo MVP : Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_9393-9642-0-249","score":32.6064563874,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2014 MLS All - Star Game August 6 , 2014 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 1 Bayern Munich ( show ) Providence Park , Portland , Oregon Wright - Phillips 51 ' Donovan 70 ' Report Lewandowski 8 ' Attendance : 21,733 Referee : Jair Marrufo MVP : Landon Donovan MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_9951-10190-0-239","score":32.4742661104,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2016 MLS All - Star Game July 28 , 2016 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 2 Arsenal ( show ) Avaya Stadium , San Jose , California Drogba 45 + 2 ' Report Campbell 10 ' ( pen . ) Akpom 87 ' Attendance : 18,000 Referee : Chris Penso MVP : Chuba Akpom MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_5905-6162-0-257","score":32.3431610158,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2002 MLS All - Star Game August 3 , 2002 MLS All - Stars 3 -- 2 United States ( show ) RFK Stadium , Washington , D.C.

However , removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest . Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams , removing the four dams would create a hole in the energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable . Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer , as submerged riffles , rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams . Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River . However , aside from restoring salmon runs , dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable , that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads , and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America . A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 .

Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation .

Many more couples , however , experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year : estimates range from 12 % to 28 % . '' 20 - 30 % of infertility cases are due to male infertility , 20 - 35 % are due to female infertility , and 25 - 40 % are due to combined problems in both parts . In 10 - 20 % of cases , no cause is found . The most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory problems which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods . Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801197945_24423-25987-0-1564","score":22.2570384381,"text":"Egg donation\nHaving an attorney draft a contract is recommended in order to ensure that the donor has no possible legal rights or responsibilities over the child or any frozen embryos .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice . The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom 's 1845 China , in a series of views .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_27877-28228-0-351","score":22.4958913619,"text":"Great Wall of China\n`` The First Mound '' -- at Jiayuguan , the western terminus The Great Wall of China at Badaling A portion of the Great Wall of China at Simatai , overlooking the gorge Mutianyu Great Wall , China .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice . The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom 's 1845 China , in a series of views .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_16571-17855-0-1284","score":33.2203159288,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nIn 221 BC , the state of Qin completed its conquest over the other Warring States and united China under Qin Shi Huang , the first emperor of China .

These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders . Once the Xiongnu were chased away , Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_1580-2418-0-838","score":37.4462781356,"text":"Great Wall of China\nThe Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone , brick , tamped earth , wood , and other materials , generally built along an east - to - west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe with an eye to expansion . Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC ; these , later joined together and made bigger and stronger , are collectively referred to as the Great Wall . Especially famous is the wall built in 220 -- 206 BC by Qin Shi Huang , the first Emperor of China . Little of that wall remains .

Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords , he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states . To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border . Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult , so builders always tried to use local resources . Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_62032-63946-0-1914","score":32.9849930019,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nEarly European accounts were mostly modest and empirical , closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall . However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ?

Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature ( with Macbeth , Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world 's greatest plays ) , and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language . Specifically , in plays like Hamlet , Shakespeare `` integrated characterization with plot , '' such that if the main character was different in any way , the plot would be totally changed . In Romeo and Juliet , Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre ( previous to Shakespeare , romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy ) .

The nutritional poverty of the soil is the reason that the plant relies on such elaborate traps : insect prey provide the nitrogen for protein formation that the soil can not . The Venus flytrap is not a tropical plant and can tolerate mild winters . In fact , Venus flytraps that do not go through a period of winter dormancy will weaken and die after a period of time .","title":"Venus flytrap","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.6666666667,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.765360637,"ndcg_cut_5":0.9674679835,"ndcg_cut_10":0.9674679835}}

Over this period , the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India , importing these from Britain 's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations , while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms , and of agricultural exports from India . Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade . In London , the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India , and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire .

Over this period , the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India , importing these from Britain 's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations , while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms , and of agricultural exports from India . Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade . In London , the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India , and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire .
