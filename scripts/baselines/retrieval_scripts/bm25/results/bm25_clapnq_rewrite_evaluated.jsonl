Once released , Patel served as interim Congress president , but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Mumbai . After the signing of the Gandhi -- Irwin Pact , Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi -- here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties . It advocated the establishment of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat . Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London , Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened , and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail . During this term of imprisonment , Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other , and the two developed a close bond of affection , trust , and frankness . Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother ( Gandhi ) and his younger brother ( Patel ) . Despite having arguments with Gandhi , Patel respected his instincts and leadership . In prison , the two discussed national and social issues , read Hindu epics , and cracked jokes . Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit . Gandhi 's secretary , Mahadev Desai , kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel . When Gandhi embarked on a fast - unto - death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables , Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food .

Under the plan of 3 June , more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan , or choosing independence . Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede , most of the people and territory would be fragmented . The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion . Gandhi had said to Patel , `` ( T ) he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it '' . Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task . He asked V. P. Menon , a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India , to become his right - hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry . On 6 May 1947 , Patel began lobbying the princes , attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts . Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs , inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi . At these meetings , Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order . Patel invoked the patriotism of India 's monarchs , asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people . He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic , especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects . He proposed favourable terms for the merger , including the creation of privy purses for the rulers ' descendants . While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism , Patel did not rule out force . Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith , he set a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate . In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

At the same time the 1898 Vaccination Act banned arm - to - arm vaccination , thus preventing transmission of syphilis by this vaccine . However , private practitioners had to purchase vaccine from commercial producers . Although proper use of glycerine reduced bacterial contamination considerably the crude starting material , scraped from the skin of infected calves , was always heavily contaminated and no vaccine was totally free from bacteria . A survey of vaccines in 1900 found wide variations in bacterial contamination . Vaccine issued by the Government Vaccine Establishment contained 5,000 bacteria per gram , while commercial vaccines contained up to 100,000 per gram . The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1925 set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram , and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections . Unfortunately glycerolated vaccine soon lost its potency at ambient temperatures which restricted its use in tropical climates . However , it remained in use into the 1970s where a satisfactory cold chain was available . Animals continued to be widely used by vaccine producers during the Smallpox Eradication Campaign . A WHO survey of 59 producers , some of whom used more than one source of vaccine , found that 39 used calves , 12 used sheep and 6 used water buffalo , whilst only 3 made vaccine in cell culture and 3 in embryonated hens ' eggs . English vaccine was occasionally made in sheep during World War I but from 1946 only sheep were used .","title":"Smallpox vaccine","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"809803788_29781-30263-0-482","score":22.118430154,"text":"Smallpox vaccine\nIn May 2007 , the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the FDA voted unanimously that a new live virus vaccine produced by Acambis , ACAM2000 , is both safe and effective for use in persons at high risk of exposure to smallpox virus .

This allowed exemption on production of a certificate of conscientious objection signed by two magistrates .

Those closely involved in the campaign were awarded the `` Order of the Bifurcated Needle '' .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_368-632-0-263","score":39.9151234589,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMLS All - Star Game Founded Region Major League Soccer ( CONCACAF ) Number of teams Current champions Real Madrid ( 1st title ) Most successful club ( s ) MLS All - Stars ( 9 times ) Television broadcasters FS1 , UniM\u00e1s , TSN , TVA Sports 2017 MLS All - Star Game","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_3512-3828-0-316","score":36.9336660798,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nTeam Winner Runner - up Total MLS All - Stars 9 6 15 MLS East 5 6 Manchester United & -- MLS West 6 Arsenal & -- Everton & -- Roma & -- Real Madrid & -- MLS USA & -- Chelsea & -- Bayern Munich & -- Celtic & -- Fulham & -- Guadalajara & -- MLS World & -- Tottenham Hotspur & -- United States & -- West Ham United & --","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_10535-10643-0-108","score":34.2015638356,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2018 MLS All - Star Game August 1 , 2018 MLS All - Stars Juventus ( show ) Mercedes - Benz Stadium , Atlanta","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_633-1349-0-716","score":33.7080133925,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nThe Major League Soccer All - Star Game is an annual soccer game held by Major League Soccer featuring select players from the league against an international club .

The film places Steve Trevor in the role of partner \/ love interest , as a fellow warrior , like he was portrayed in the original comics . This version of Trevor , a United States Army Air Service 94th Aero Squadron pilot with the American Expeditionary Forces , is a captain and an Allied spy in World War I who has stolen information from a weapons facility in the Ottoman Empire run by German general Erich Ludendorff , whose scientist Doctor Maru is producing a new , deadlier form of mustard gas . Diana goes with Steve to take part in the War , and he acts as her guide into the world outside of Themyscira and how mankind functions . The two grow closer along the way , but are conflicted when Steve is more focused on stopping Doctor Maru 's bombs and Diana thinks that killing Ares will stop the war . In the climax , Steve hijacks a German strategic bomber containing the gas and sacrifices himself to incinerate it at a safe distance , his last words being to tell Diana that he can save today while she could save the world and tells her that he loves her , leaving her with his father 's watch as a keepsake before he jumps onto the plane . His sacrifice leads Diana to believe that ultimately the world can only be saved through love , not hatred . In 2017 , Bruce Wayne retrieves the original group photo and his father 's watch and returns it to Diana , who sends him an email thanking him for bringing Steve back to her .

Before each photograph , there will be an indication , such as a light or a buzzer , that will signal the patron to prepare their pose . After the last photograph in the series ( typically between 3 and 8 ) has been taken , the photo booth begins developing the film -- a process that used to take several minutes in the old `` wet chemistry '' booths , but is now typically accomplished in about 30 seconds with digital technology . The prints are then delivered to the customer . Typical dimensions of these prints vary .

Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945 , because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home islands . The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and obsolete planes , and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there was no return trip , the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched further . Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all the way to the target , the proportion of hits was much higher than in ordinary bombing .

For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_34436-35622-0-1186","score":25.3871420692,"text":"Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs have also been featured in film and television .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage .

Safer bedding materials made from hardwoods ( such as aspen ) , paper products , and corn cob materials are other alternatives . Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages ; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them , and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces , making it difficult to remove .

As this practice increased , some men were able to make a living out of acting as deputy constables or as paid night watchmen .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_7094-7305-0-211","score":33.1463487464,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2006 MLS All - Star Game August 5 , 2006 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 0 Chelsea ( show ) Toyota Park , Bridgeview , Illinois De Rosario 70 ' Report Attendance : 21,210 Referee : Abbey Okulaja MVP : Dwayne De Rosario MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_7327-7564-0-235","score":32.6064563874,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2007 MLS All - Star Game July 19 , 2007 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 0 Celtic ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado \u00c1ngel 36 ' Toja 44 ' Report Attendance : 18,661 Referee : Baldomero Toledo MVP : Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_9393-9642-0-249","score":32.6064563874,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2014 MLS All - Star Game August 6 , 2014 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 1 Bayern Munich ( show ) Providence Park , Portland , Oregon Wright - Phillips 51 ' Donovan 70 ' Report Lewandowski 8 ' Attendance : 21,733 Referee : Jair Marrufo MVP : Landon Donovan MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_9951-10190-0-239","score":32.4742661104,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2016 MLS All - Star Game July 28 , 2016 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 2 Arsenal ( show ) Avaya Stadium , San Jose , California Drogba 45 + 2 ' Report Campbell 10 ' ( pen . ) Akpom 87 ' Attendance : 18,000 Referee : Chris Penso MVP : Chuba Akpom MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_5905-6162-0-257","score":32.3431610158,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2002 MLS All - Star Game August 3 , 2002 MLS All - Stars 3 -- 2 United States ( show ) RFK Stadium , Washington , D.C.

A Penobscot woman , Rebecca Sockbeson , a Penobscot , is quoted saying that her people have survived on fish from this river , but `` now we are dying from it . '' She continued on to say that `` neither dioxin nor cancer is indigenous to the Penobscot people , however they are both pervasive in my tribal community .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_33770-34412-0-642","score":32.5661865565,"text":"Guinea pig\nThe Fairy Caravan , a novel by Beatrix Potter , and Michael Bond 's Olga da Polga series for children , both feature guinea pigs as the protagonist .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s .

With the advent of solid - state amplification , the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical to use the same cable conductors and connector for audio and power . During the 1960s several powering methods were developed , mainly in Europe . The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as de : Tonaderspeisung or T - power and DIN 45596 for phantom power . Since the 1980s , phantom power has become much more common , because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones .

For instance , some theorists view power as distinct from exchanges , some view it as a kind of exchange and others believe power is a medium of exchange . However , the most useful definition of power is that proposed by Emerson , who developed a theory of power - dependence relations . According to this theory , the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power . Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups , such as an individual having superiority over another . Power within the theory is governed by two variables : the structure of power in exchange networks and strategic use .

The Palm Beach County Courthouse and Board of County Commissioners building suffered only broken windows . A portion of the roof at the police department was peeled off . At city hall , windows were broken and four out of the five floors sustained damage . A total of 20 city - owned buildings were impacted structurally , with an overall loss of about $12.3 million . At the Carefree Theatre , a theatre that screened foreign films and hosted small concerts , suffered extensive roof damage . The Carefree Theatre was moved into a former church building in 2007 and renamed The Theatre , but closed in 2008 . A roof leak at St. Mary 's Medical Center forced staff to evacuate patients to other rooms .

Nevertheless , many cities began to opt for separate sewer systems , creating favorable conditions for adding wastewater treatment plants in the future .","title":"Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"865292047_10006-10907-0-901","score":27.0998124735,"text":"Environmental issues in India\nIndia has major water pollution issues .

This is due to the rise of urban areas in developing countries and the need to keep up with the economic development . There has always been many child care services available but due to the high costs , they were mainly unavailable for the low income families . Childcare became a hot topic of discussion when more women were joining the workforce and the debate of how this would affect how the children would be raised . Another topic of debate is how would the women pay for these expensive services while working minimum wage jobs or having limited times they could work , so the idea of subsidizes arose . In specific to the child , the topic of `` street children '' , how and where children should grow up , was debated , and if they should be allowed to be considered part of the street instead of a particular home . This issue was of great debate because it not only affects the child but also the community the child is in , since they usually seek out public spaces for shelter , food and play . Childcare is generally broken into three general categories such as governmental institutions , religious organizations , and independent agencies ( such as NGOS ) .

For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836413300_3763-4293-0-530","score":20.2449555572,"text":"Infertility\n`` Infertility is `` a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse ( and there is no other reason , such as breastfeeding or postpartum amenorrhoea ) .

When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West , European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial `` Great Wall '' in his Travels . Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall . Thus , Father Martino Martini 's mistaken claim that the Wall had `` lasted right up to the present time without injury or destruction '' since the time of Qin was accepted as fact by the 18th - century philosophes .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_62032-63946-0-1914","score":30.916116184,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nEarly European accounts were mostly modest and empirical , closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall .

In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

General Meng Tian erected walls beyond the northern loop of the Yellow River , effectively linking the border walls of Qin , Zhao , and Yan . Concurrent to the building of the frontier wall was the destruction of the walls within China that used to divide one warring state from another -- contrary to the outer walls , which were built to stabilize the newly united China , the inner walls threatened the unity of the empire . In the following year , 214 BC , Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north . This work was completed probably by 212 BC , signalled by Qin Shi Huang 's imperial tour of inspection and the construction of the Direct Road ( \u76f4\u9053 ) connecting the capital Xianyang with the Ordos .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

In 1779 , David toured the newly excavated ruins of Pompeii , which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power . While in Rome , David also assiduously studied the High Renaissance painters , Raphael making a profound and lasting impression on the young French artist .","title":"Jacques-Louis David","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"856451263_3714-4003-0-289","score":16.3608303529,"text":"Elk\nThe name wapiti is from the Shawnee and Cree word waapiti , meaning `` white rump '' .

In 127 BC , General Wei Qing invaded the much - contested Ordos region as far as the Qin fortifications set up by Meng Tian . In this way , Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe . In addition to rebuilding the walls , archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu 's reign . The fortifications here include embankments , beacon stations , and forts , all constructed with a combination of tamped - earth cores and stone frontages . From the Ordos Loop , the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei , Zhangye , and Jiuquan , leading into the Juyan Lake Basin , and terminating in two places : the Yumen Pass in the north , or the Yang Pass to the south , both in the vicinity of Dunhuang . Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications -- further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass , about 460 kilometres ( 290 mi ) to the east . The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian . Behind this line of fortifications , the Han government was able to maintain its settlements and its communications to the Western Regions in central Asia , generally secure from attacks from the north .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel .

The episode that would ultimately transform the friends ' relationship for the remainder of the series was the first - season finale `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' , in which Rachel finally learns of Ross ' true feelings for her , at the same time discovering she actually feels the same . However , the episode nearly went unwritten because , at the time , few Friends writers were expecting the couple 's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became . The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows ; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple 's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive `` he 's pining , she 's oblivious '' pattern , using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel . Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high , `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' became Friends ' most reworked episode . The couple 's first kiss at the end of season two 's `` The One Where Ross Finds Out '' was met with deafening applause from the studio audience . Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging . Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by `` dangl ( ing ) the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together . '' According to Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb , Ross and Rachel 's ever - changing relationship `` converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama .

He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

The 1994 film The Punk uses both the rough plot outline of Romeo and Juliet and names many of the characters in ways that reflect the characters in the play . In 2006 , Disney 's High School Musical made use of Romeo and Juliet 's plot , placing the two young lovers in different high school cliques instead of feuding families . Film - makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet . The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing Romeo and Juliet has been used several times , including John Madden 's 1998 Shakespeare in Love , in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair . An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think , called Romeo x Juliet , was made in 2007 and the 2013 version is the latest English - language film based on the play . In 2013 , Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram - Leela , a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles . The film was a commercial and critical success . In February 2014 , BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of Romeo and Juliet . The production starred Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad .

Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other . That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers ' language : Juliet , for example , speaks of `` my only love sprung from my only hate '' and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo 's death .

He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' .

These enterprises employed only 440,000 people out of the total urban labor force of 128 million in 1985 and paid average annual salaries of \u00a5 1,373 , only slightly higher than the overall urban national average .","title":"Standard of living in China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"830211656_4801-5964-0-1163","score":26.9736574409,"text":"Economy of India under the British Raj\nSeveral historians have suggested that that the lack of industrialization was because India was still a largely agricultural nation with low wages levels , arguing that wages were high in Britain so cotton producers had the incentive to invent and purchase expensive new labour - saving technologies , and that wages levels were low in India so producers preferred to increase output by hiring more workers rather than investing in technology . Several economic historians have criticized this argument , such as Prasannan Parthasarathi who pointed to earnings data that show real wages in 18th - century Bengal and Mysore were higher than in Britain . Workers in the textile industry , for example , earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain , while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore .

India 's paper industry produces over 3,000 metric tonnes annually from more than 400 mills . The furniture and craft industry is another consumer of wood . India 's wood - based processing industries consumed about 30 million cubic metres of industrial wood in 2002 . India annually consumes an additional 270 million tonnes of fuelwood , 2800 million tonnes of fodder , and about 102 million cubic meter of forest products - valued at about \u20b9 27,500 crore ( US $4.3 billion ) a year . India is one of the world 's largest consumer of fuel - wood . India 's consumption of fuel - wood is about five times higher than what can be sustainably removed from forests . However , a large percentage of this fuel - wood is grown as biomass remaining from agriculture , and is managed outside forests . Fuel - wood meets about 40 % of the energy needs of the country . Around 80 % of rural people and 48 % of urban people use fuel - wood . Unless India makes major , rapid and sustained effort to expand electricity generation and power plants , the rural and urban poor in India will continue to meet their energy needs through unsustainable destruction of forests and fuel wood consumption . India 's dependence on fuel - wood and forestry products as a primary energy source is not only environmentally unsustainable , it is a primary cause of India 's near - permanent haze and air pollution .","title":"Forestry in India","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"816711474_9390-9624-0-234","score":17.8492546117,"text":"Industrial Revolution\nWages in Lancashire , a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving , were about one - sixth those in India in 1770 , when overall productivity in Britain was about three times higher than in India .
