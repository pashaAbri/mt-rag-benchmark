Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it. To test whether your fixes address the issue, you can convert the original file to a PDF file to check for unexpected carriage returns in the text.\n\nAfter applying a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model to a PPT file, table boundaries are not recognized properly\n: During the conversion process, text that is extracted from the table is confused with text that is outside the table in some PPT pages.

You can create a separate collection and apply the Parts of Speech enrichment so you can use the term suggestions feature to speed up the process of creating the dictionary.\n* Creating separate Smart Document Understanding (SDU) models\n\nYou can use the Smart Document Understanding tool to identify content based on the structure of a document. If you have 20 PDF files that were created by your Sales department and use one template and 20 PDF files that were created by your Research department and use a different template, group each set into its own collection. You can then use the SDU tool to build a model for each structure separately, a model that understands the unique structure. You can also use the tool to define custom fields that are unique to the source documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a collection \n\nBefore you can create a collection, you must create a project. For more information, see [Creating projects](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects).\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n\n\n* A collection can support only one external data source.\n* Documents in the collection must be in one language only, the language that you specify for the collection.\n\n\n\nTo create a collection, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Open a project, go to the Manage collections page, and then click New collection.\n\n\n\n* The Conversational Search, Document Retrieval, and Custom project types can contain up to 5 collections.\n* A Content Mining project can contain only 1 collection.\n\n\n\n2.

Critical data that changes more often might require more frequent backups than static data. Ask which data is most critical and which is to be archived.\n* Keep costs down by retaining backups for only while you need them to prevent data loss. Plan timely backups to restore data that might be deleted or corrupted. Think about the type of events that might happen. Ask how much data you can afford to lose. The answers can help you decide on a backup interval.\n* Ask how quickly you need to recover the data. Frequent backups that cover smaller incremental changes to your data afford quicker restoration. Run a test failover and volume restore to get an idea of the time it can take.\n* For best performance, stagger your backup jobs by creating backup plans with different intervals. You can have up to four different backup plans per backup policy.\n* For large volumes, consider a shorter retention period so that you don't exceed the 10 TB limit for all volume backups.\n* If you have volumes in different regions, create separate backup policies for each region. You're limited to 10 backup policies per account in a region.\n* Ensure that the volumes that you tagged for backups are attached to a virtual server instance. You can't back up detached volumes.\n* Provide a unique name for your backup policy. If you have a convention for naming volumes, you might name a backup policy by using a similar convention. Backups that are created by a policy can also follow the convention. As the number of backups grow, a good naming convention can make them more identifiable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practices for user actions \n\n\n\n* Organize tags that you apply to volumes and specify in backup policies. Ensure that multiple policies aren't using the same tags for target resources because that might trigger duplicate volume backups. You need only one tag to match to trigger a backup.\n* Determine what tags are already assigned to a volume from the list of Block Storage for VPC volumes.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16276-4355-6349", "score": 12.204350393008138, "text": "\nIf your action asks for the same type of data in more than one step, use the Always ask for this information setting to prevent the assistant from making incorrect assumptions.

However, you can add a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points your preferred DNS name to the auto-assigned load balancer DNS name. For example, your load balancer in us-south has ID dd754295-e9e0-4c9d-bf6c-58fbc59e5727, and the auto-assigned load balancer DNS name is dd754295-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud.

If the user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to still access their anonymous attributes by attaching their anonymous profile to their user identity with App ID.\n\n\n\n Understanding progressive authentication \n\nWhen a user chooses not to sign in immediately, they are considered an anonymous user. For example, say you're an online retailer and you want to allow users to add objects to their shopping cart without signing in. However, you ask them to sign in to complete their purchase. If a user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to access the same objects that were in their shopping carts before they signed in.\n\nYou can use App ID to gather information about anonymous users into an anonymous user profile, which you can use to help personalize their experience of your application. If the user chooses to signs in, you can attach the user attributes that are part of the anonymous profile to their user identity that is stored in App ID. Anonymous profiles are temporarily valid. While you develop your app, you can [configure the lifetime](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-managing-idpidp-token-lifetime) of anonymous tokens.\n\nWhen a user signs in, they become an identified user. If an existing identified user profile does not exist, you can create a new identified user profile.

However, an identified user can still access the attributes of their anonymous profile because they are accessible with the new access and identity tokens.\n\nYou can attach the attributes of only one anonymous profile to the user's identity that is stored in App ID. For example, say that a user browses your application anonymously in two separate browser tabs.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step.

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

However, you must reactivate the free plan every 45 days. This reactivation process keeps resources available for other users by turning off inactive usage.\n\nWhen your plan nears its reactivation date, you will receive a reactivation request at the email address that you provided when creating the instance. Alternatively, you can reactivate in your Db2 on Cloud console.\n\n\n\n\n\n Will my data be deleted? \n\nAfter you create a Lite instance, you have 45 days before the next reactivation.\n\n\n\n* If you do not reactivate, your Lite plan will be disabled, but IBM Cloud still has your data. You will then have 60 days to reactivate your account.\n* If you don't reactivate within 60 days, your account and data will be deleted. We will send you multiple emails reminding you to reactivate.\n\n\n\nEach time you reactivate, the day counter resets, and you'll have another 45 days before being disabled (and 60 days before deletion).\n\n\n\n\n\n How can I download a backup of my data on the Lite plan? \n\nHere are two simple options for backing up Lite plan data:\n\n\n\n* Use Db2 tools like the command line tool (clp) or IBM Data Studio to do an export. You can then import at another time.\n* To quickly make a backup, use the Web console, run a query, then download the results to a CSV file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change the email I use for reactivation? \n\nCreate a new Lite instance with the email you want to use going forward.

One of these languages most likely comes with convenient client-side libraries that integrate IBM Cloudant access nicely, following the conventions that you expect for your tools. These languages are great for programmer efficiency, but they also hide the API from view.\n\nThis abstraction is what you want, the whole reason for using a client library is to save yourself repeated, tedious boiler-plating. However, you must understand the underlying API is vital when you troubleshoot and report problems.

The GET /todolist endpoint uses the postFind method to query the database for all documents (by using the index created after the todo database), and then orders the notes by timestamp, and returns them to the front end for display.\n\nFiltering by tag uses the same postFind method, but by using the second index, you create and delete notes by using the postDocument and deleteDocument methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIBM Cloudant allows rapid development of web applications, as its HTTP API is modeled by the [Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm-cloud/cloudant) and is easy to integrate with your own code. You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant).

By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16299-1512-2608", "score": 14.753009887980745, "text": "\n* [Web chat development overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop): You can use the web chat API to extensively customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat.\n* Customizing the phone integration: You can use commands and context variables to extensively configure how your assistant interacts with users using the phone integration.

It can also collect information during a conversation, and reference it later in the same conversation. For example, you might want to ask for the customer's name and then address the person by name later on.\n\nThe following script preserves the context of the conversation. In addition, it adds an $ismember context variable and sets it to true.\n\nThe name that is specified for the skill (main skill) is a hardcoded name that is used to refer to any skill that you create from the product user interface.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16299-7-2120", "score": 13.766922629515216, "text": "\nOverview: Customizing and developing \n\nThe Watson Assistant user interface makes it easy to build an assistant and deploy it to your customers without writing any code.

It can also collect information during a conversation, and reference it later in the same conversation. For example, you might want to ask for the customer's name and then address the person by name later on.\n\nThe following script preserves the context of the conversation. In addition, it adds an $ismember context variable and sets it to true.\n\nThe name that is specified for the skill (main skill) is a hardcoded name that is used to refer to any skill that you create from the product user interface. You do not need to edit your skill name.\n\n<script>\nfunction preSendhandler(event) {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03188-3379-5204", "score": 33.26375232747462, "text": "\nThe rich response types often behave differently when they are displayed in different built-in integrations or in the assistant preview.

No private variables are sent from the dialog to any integrations. For more information about how to pass data, see [Passing sensitive data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt).\n\nTo access the payload data, you can reference the context.integrations.chat.private.user_payload object from the dialog node condition.\n\nYou must know the structure of the JSON object that is sent in the payload.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-integrations"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16298-6367-7794", "score": 33.153877166566886, "text": "\nFor more information see [Securing the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security).\n2. Encrypt sensitive information that you pass to the web chat.\n\nWhen you enable security in Zendesk, you must provide the name and email address of the current user with each request. Configure the web chat to pass this information in the payload.\n\nSpecify the information by using the following syntax. Use the exact names (name and email) for the two name and value pairs.\n\n{\nuser_payload : {\nname: '{customerName}',\nemail: '{customerEmail}'\n}\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Passing sensitive data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt).\n\nZendesk also expects iat and external_id name and value pairs.

Information that is passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private variable in your assistant. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for less important customers. You likely do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such. But you must pass this informataion to your dialog because it changes the route of the conversation. You can pass the customer MVP status as an encrypted variable. This private context variable will be available for use by the dialog, but not by anything else.\n\n\n\n1. From the web chat configuration page, copy the public key from the IBM provided public key field.\n2. From your website, write a function that signs a JSON Web Token.\n\nFor example, the following NodeJS code snippet shows a function that accepts a userID and payload content and sends it to the web chat.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-deploy-web-chat"}]}

The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

The suggestions that are offered give the customer a quick way to get the conversation back on track.\n\nThe suggestions list is populated with dialog nodes that condition on intents that are related in some way to the matched intent. The intents are ones that the AI model considered to be possible alternatives, but that didn't meet the high confidence threshold that is required for a node to be listed as a disambiguation option.

With IBM Cloud\u00ae App ID, you can configure one or several identity providers to create a custom sign-in experience for your users.\n\nApp ID interacts with identity providers by using various protocols such as OpenID Connect, SAML, and more. For example, OpenID Connect is the protocol that is used with many social providers such as Facebook, Google. Enterprise providers such as [Azure Active Directory](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-azure-active-directory) or [Active Directory Federation Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-active-directory-federation-service), generally use SAML as their identity protocol. For [Cloud Directory](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), the service uses SCIM to verify identity information.\n\nWhen you use social or enterprise identity providers, App ID reads user account information. Because the service never has write access to the information, users must go through their chosen identity provider to do actions, such as resetting their password. For example, if a user signs in to your app with Facebook, and then wanted to change their password, they must go to www.facebook.com to do so.\n\nWhen you use [Cloud Directory](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), App ID is the identity provider.

Because App ID is the identity provider, users can take advantage of advanced functionality, such as resetting their password, directly in your app.\n\nWorking with application identity?

A database prioritizing consistency and availability is simple: a single node stores a single copy of your data. But this model is difficult to scale as you must upgrade the node to get more performance, rather than use extra nodes. And, even a minor system failure can shut down a single-node system, while any message loss means significant data loss. To endure, the system must become more sophisticated.\n\n\n\n Tradeoffs in partition tolerance \n\nA database that prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance commonly employs a primary-secondary setup, where one node of the many in the system is elected leader. Only the leader approves data writes, while all secondary nodes replicate data from the leader to handle reads. If the leader loses connection to the network, or can't communicate with many of the system's nodes, the remainder elects a new leader. This election process differs between systems, and might be a source of [significant problems](https://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb).\n\nIBM Cloudant prioritizes availability and partition tolerance by employing a primary-primary setup, such that every node can accept both writes and reads to its portion of your data. Multiple nodes include copies of each portion of your data. Each node copies data with other nodes. If a node becomes inaccessible, others can serve in its place while the network heals. This way, the system returns your data in a timely manner despite arbitrary node failure, and maintains [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). The tradeoff in deprioritizing absolute consistency is that it takes time for all nodes to see the same data. As a result, some responses might include old data while the new data propagates through the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing the approach \n\nMaintaining one consistent view of data is logical and easy to understand because a relational database does this work for you. The expectation is that web-based services that interact with database systems behave in this way. But that expectation doesn't mean that they do work this way. Consistency isn't a given, and it takes a little work to change the approach.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theorem"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14508-7-1988", "score": 7.974628297697467, "text": "\nVMware Aria Operations Manager design \n\nThe VMware Aria\u00ae Operations\u2122 Manager (formerly known as VMware vRealize\u00ae Operations Manager\u2122) Analytics Cluster contains the nodes that analyze and store data from the monitored components.

The database, storage, and supporting infrastructure all run in IBM Cloud.\n\nDatabases for Elasticsearch provides replication, fail-over, and high-availability features to protect your databases and data from infrastructure maintenance, upgrades, and failures. Deployments contain a cluster with three nodes where all three are data nodes and any node can be the primary node. Elasticsearch clusters work on a quorum system, if one data member becomes unreachable, your cluster continues to operate normally. If more nodes go down and the cluster can't maintain a quorum, it becomes read-only to protect your data. The cluster resumes normal operations when the nodes are recovered or new nodes are added.\n\nWhen you add an index to Elasticsearch, it splits the data into shards and spreads those shards across the nodes in the cluster. The sharded configuration allows for Elasticsearch to run concurrent operations on your data across all the nodes. Concerning high-availability, not all shards contain a complete copy of all the data in the index. To enforce that multiple complete copies of the data are spread across the cluster in a node failure, you should ensure that when you create an index you set the replica count to at least 1. Setting the replica count to 0 can cause data loss.\n\nIf you [add nodes to your cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-elasticsearch?topic=databases-for-elasticsearch-horizontal-scaling), Elasticsearch automatically rebalances the shards and replicas of your indexes across the newly added node or nodes. Adding nodes can provide more stability in a multi-node failure, since you can lose more nodes and maintain a quorum. More nodes also improves performance.\n\n\n\n Staying Production Ready \n\nTo keep your IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for Elasticsearch database up and running, do not drop the icd-auth index.

Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data.

As it is updated real-time, it's a great way to track changes to state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Metrics and dashboards \n\nIn this section explore the monitoring and metrics dashboards included in Red Hat OpenShift.\n\n\n\n Dashboards \n\nRed Hat OpenShift comes with predefined dashboards to monitor your projects.\n\n\n\n1. Get started by switching from the Developer perspective to the Administrator perspective:\n2. Navigate to Observe > Dashboards in the left-hand bar.\n3. Select Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Pods) from the dropdown and Namespace to example-health.\n4. Notice the CPU and Memory usage for your application. In production environments, this is helpful for identifying the average amount of CPU or Memory your application uses, especially as it can fluctuate through the day. Auto-scaling is one way to handle fluctuations and will be demonstrated a little later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Metrics \n\nRed Hat OpenShift provides a web interface to run queries and examine the metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides an extensive overview of the cluster state and enables you to troubleshoot problems.\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to Observe > Metrics.\n2. Enter the following expression and click Run queries. You should see the value and the graph associated with the query.\n\nsum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container=\"patient-health-frontend\"})\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-openshift-microservices"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04238-7-2046", "score": 20.674565302241763, "text": "\nTroubleshooting Citrix DaaS for IBM Cloud Classic \n\nUse this information to troubleshoot Citrix DaaS for IBM Cloud\u00ae on Classic.\n\n\n\n Connection timeouts or long login times \n\nIf you are experiencing intermittent, long session login times, connection timeouts, or network instability, you can set a Citrix policy that disables the Citrix Enlightened Data Transport Protocol (EDT).

This maintenance upgrades the software on the underlying hypervisor, update the firmware on the systems, or other security and performance updates. In general, users don't experience any issues during these upgrades. Modifications that require host maintenance are applied with no or little impact to running services in most cases. Scenarios can occur where the user is involved during maintenance operations, which are discussed in the [Possible impacts to virtual server instances during maintenance operations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-cloud-maintenancemaintenance-impacts) section.\n\nMost updates are done transparently to the host and the virtual servers that run on those hosts do not see any disruption. Nondisruptive changes can occur multiple times per week or even daily if necessary, all without impacting the user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data center maintenance \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae also performs periodic data center maintenance upgrades. Users don't generally experience any issues during data center maintenance. Examples of this maintenance can be updates to the network, power infrastructure, or server hardware in a data center. Most maintenance is performed without impact to the user\u2019s workloads. Some infrequent scenarios can occur where the user might need to be involved during those operations, which are discussed in the following section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Possible impacts to virtual server instances during maintenance operations \n\nSome changes can require a secure live migration of a virtual server to update the hypervisor or host. These changes can be a firmware update, an event where the hypervisor kernel cannot be live patched, or load balancing. The regular live migration process is nondisruptive and use of dedicated hosts and virtual servers is not interrupted.\n\nWhen nondisruptive live migration occurs, the virtual server experiences a brief pause of around 10 seconds, and in some cases up to 30 seconds. You are not notified in advance of nondisruptive migration. The virtual server instance is not restarted as part of this process.\n\nIn cases where a disruptive migration is required, you are notified 30 days in advance of the scheduled migration.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-cloud-maintenance"}]}

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

Indexing helps your queries remain performant as your application scales.\n\nWhen you tell IBM Cloudant to create a secondary index, it starts a background task that looks at all the documents in turn and creates a new data structure on disk: the index.

As you add more training data, the service instance becomes more accurate and sophisticated in the ordering of results it returns.\n\nRelevancy training is optional; if the results of your queries meet your needs, no further training is necessary. For information about use cases for relevancy training, see [Improve your natural language query results from Watson Discovery](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/improving-your-natural-language-query-results-from-watson-discovery/).\n\nFor comprehensive information about the training APIs, see the [API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery).\n\nIf you would prefer to use the Discovery tooling to train Discovery, see [Improving result relevance with the tooling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-tooling).\n\nRelevance training currently applies only to natural language queries in private collections. It is not intended for use with structured Discovery Query Language queries. For more about the Discovery Query Language, see [Query concepts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-concepts).\n\nTrained collections return a confidence score in the result of a natural language query.

Discovery provides an API that can be embedded in your application to track events. Calling this API with the appropriate information when a user performs an action sends a signal back to Discovery, which can then be viewed in the logs.\n\nEvents can help gather information on computing metrics (like clickthrough rate) to measure how effective the application is at helping end users find relevant information, or can be used to help seed training by reviewing the queries and clicks to start to build ground truth.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-usage"}]}

Unlike Discovery Query Language queries, with natural language queries you cannot specify which fields from the document you care about or how much significance to give to each one.

With enough examples, Discovery can return better answers because it knows where the best answers are typically stored.\n\nRelevancy training cannot be used to give more weight to nested fields. Nested fields are grouped and assigned one overall score. No matter how much you train, Discovery never gives a nested field more weight than it gives to a root-level field.

If you are routinely exceeding your provisioned capacity, no amount of retrying gets the database work done - you need more capacity!\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Querying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Querying video \n\nLearn the different ways to query data in IBM Cloudant.\n\n\n\n* Querying video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 10 - Querying.\n\nSo far we performed CRUD (create, retrieve, update, and delete) operations from the command line, the dashboard, and from code. These operations use the document's _id:\n\n\n\n* Fetch document by _id.\n* Update document whose _id = 'x'.\n* Delete document whose _id = 'x'.\n* Get documents in the _id range 'a' to 'z'.\n\n\n\nThese operations are the building blocks of a database, but they get you only so far. What if you need to return a subset of documents that match on fields within the document? A person's birth date?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13493-2289-4276", "score": 15.741570706365533, "text": "\n* Use the INTO clause of a [query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterSQLQueryStatement) to specify the output [URI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-runningunique), that is, the location to which the result is to be written and the wanted result format.\n\n\n\n2. The Target location field displays where the result is stored. An initial bucket in one of your Object Storage instances is automatically created for you when you open the UI. It is then chosen as your default location, if your query does not specify an INTO clause. To ensure the automatic setup of an initial bucket, do the following steps in advance:\n\n\n\n* You must create an Object Storage instance.\n* You must have at least 'Writer' access to the corresponding Object Storage bucket.\n\n\n\nIn the Details tab of the selected job, you can set any location that you specified in the INTO clause as your default location.\n3. Click Run.\n\nWhen the query completes, a preview of the query result is displayed in the query result tab of the UI. The preview function is only available for CSV and JSON result formats. You can run up to five queries simultaneously with a Standard plan instance of Data Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sample queries \n\nWhat does a typical query look like? The following sample queries give you an idea to get you started:\n\n\n\n Example of a table exploration query \n\nThe following query selects all columns of a table and limits the result to 50 rows. Use it to explore a particular table.\n\nSELECT \nFROM cos://us-geo/sql/customers.csv STORED AS CSV\nORDER BY CustomerID\nLIMIT 50\n\n\n\n\n\n Example of an exact target path specification \n\nThe following query writes an SQL result into an exact result path. Normally, Data Engine always appends jobid=<jobid> to the provided target path to ensure a unique result location with each query execution. However, in the following sample query, this suffix is eliminated by adding JOBPREFIX NONE to the path in the INTO clause.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-running"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07096-7-1899", "score": 15.726123481851292, "text": "\nQuery operators \n\nYou can use operators when you write queries to submit to Discovery by using the Query API.\n\nThe types of operators that are supported differ by query type:\n\n\n\n* [Natural language queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-operatorsnlq-operator)\n* [Discovery Query Language (DQL) queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-operatorsdql-operators)\n\n\n\n\n\n Natural Language Query (NLQ) operator \n\nThe natural_language_query parameter accepts a string value.\n\n\n\n \"\" (Phrase query) \n\nUse quotation marks to emphasize a single word or phrase in the query that is most important to match.

To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00539-4998-6652", "score": 16.37805535678577, "text": "\nWhen you execute a query, passing execution_stats: true as an extra parameter forces IBM Cloudant to enumerate the number of documents it scanned in performing the query, for example:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"sort\": [\"date\"],\n\"limit\": 10,\n\"execution_stats\": true\n}\n\nThe returned data now includes an extra JSON object:\n\n{\n...\n\"execution_stats\": {\n\"total_keys_examined\": 0,\n\"total_docs_examined\": 1000000,\n\"total_quorum_docs_examined\": 0,\n\"results_returned\": 2,\n\"execution_time_ms\": 4400.699\n}\n}\n\nThe ratio between total_docs_examined and results_returned is key here: a high value indicates that too many documents are being scanned per document that is returned.\n\nFor more information, see [Blog post on Optimizing IBM Cloudant Queries](https://blog.cloudant.com/2020/04/24/Optimising-Cloudant-Queries.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n Which IBM Cloudant Query operators defeat the use of an index? \n\nAny of the [combination operators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryoperators) other than $and can make a query do a full database scan without the help of a secondary index. For example, if an $or operator is used, then no secondary index can be used to assist the query. If in doubt, use the [POST /{db}/_explain](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=javapostexplain) endpoint to check that an index is used, and the execution_stats: true parameter to measure the efficiency of each query.\n\nFor a type=json index to be used to support a query, it must match the fields that are used in the selector and sort parameters. Comparison operators might be used on the last element to perform range queries.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}]}

Any additional controls that are needed within a tenancy must be provisioned separately by using a gateway, security groups, or host-based controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Benefits of moving to VRF \n\nMoving to VRF includes the following primary benefits:\n\n\n\n* Industry-proven and widely accepted multiple isolation separation technologies. Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network. During conversion, your shared tenancy is converted to use a customer VRF, most commonly with a new Direct Link subscription.\n\nFor specific information about how to initiate a VRF conversion for your account, refer to the conversion instructions for your IBM Cloud offering.

Some services require a functional ID when you create service instances, for example the Kubernetes Service.\n\nA functional ID is a type of user ID that exists in your Identity Provider's (IdP) user directory, but it's not tied to a specific user. To create a functional ID, you must create a new user in the user directory and invite them to your IBM Cloud account.\n\nThe functional ID is used to create service instances, like Kubernetes Service clusters. This way, instances aren't linked to a specific person that might leave the company, which would leave the instance without an owner. Generally, functional IDs can do more in IBM Cloud than a service ID. For example, functional IDs, like user IDs, can be granted access to services and applications through access policies.\n\nIBM Cloud API keys for users can be created and associated with a functional ID. If a service requires a user API key for interacting with other services or applications, use the functional ID API key. By using the API key that is associated with the functional ID, you can provide only the access that is needed for that service.\n\nIf you're using a functional ID as the account owner, instead consider [Setting an alternative account owner](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-classic-infra-owner&interface=ui). This is available only for classic infrastructure accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Service IDs \n\nService IDs are another type of identity that is used in an account. Service IDs are used to provide a separate identity for services and applications. Service IDs are best used when an application or service needs a digital identity and needs access to only IAM-enabled resources. You can create a service ID to be used by an application that needs access to your IBM Cloud services so that individual user credentials don't need to be used.\n\n\n\n Service ID API keys", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-identity-overview"}]}

However, when you store passwords, any person with access to the account and appropriate permissions can view the passwords that are stored on the Passwords screen.\n5. Access your server on the private network. You can use the IBM Cloud infrastructure private network to interact with your devices through remote desktop (RDP) by using SSH and KVM over IP. You can use the VPN Access tool for private network connection to either the closest SSL VPN endpoint or to the endpoint of your choice. VPN access is also required to interact with several services. To access the private network, edit the user\u2019s VPN access from the User List. To access the User List, click Account > Users > User list. Use the [Virtual Private Network](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpn-access) page to connect to one of the various VPN options.\n6.

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced. Changes that you make in one area must be evaluated and coordinated with changes that you make in another area. For example, if you add an entity type, review the guidelines for annotating relation types and specify how the new entity type can relate to other entity types.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotation guidelines example \n\nMost annotation guidelines will need a lot of detail and examples to ensure that human annotators consistently annotate text.\n\nThe example presented here is a simple guideline that was created for a small domain that contains traffic incident reports.\n\n\n\n Task Goals \n\n\n\n* As project members, become familiar with the iterative process of manual annotation and machine learning model refinement.\n* Annotate documents in the automotive domain with the ground truth editor and use the annotations to train a machine learning model.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16456-8225-10384", "score": 14.505973685753224, "text": "\nThe labels that can be applied are entity types defined in the workspace's type system.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nBefore starting to annotate entity mentions in a document, it's a good practice to read the entire document. Doing so can help keep the entire context in mind while annotating, and can help provide insights into how entity mentions might relate to each other and which mentions might need to be coreferenced in future passes through the document.\n\nWhen you open a document to annotate it, you might want to use the concordance tool to annotate repeating entity mentions first, and then annotate individual entity mentions. You can then annotate relation mentions and coreferences in any order that you like, or not at all. Entity mention annotation is mandatory. Whether you also annotate relation mentions and coreferences depends on the purpose of your model and the needs of your domain. However, until and unless you identify coreferences, each entity mention is considered to represent a distinct entity.\n\n\n\n Tips \n\n\n\n* Keep in mind that shorter entity mentions are better for training because it is easier for the machine learning model to recognize the shorter patterns and add the correct annotation tokens.\n* If you chose to use a dictionary-based tokenizer with the workspace, and want to handle compound terms and punctuation in your training data, you can add the terms to a dictionary and create a dictionary annotator to pre-annotate the occurrences. For example, to avoid sentence boundary breaks for terms that include punctuation, add terms like Yahoo! and Dr. to a dictionary. Likewise, if your training data includes hyphenated words or alphanumeric acronyms, like Hi-C or MS-60-70, add those terms to the dictionary. To annotate occurrences regardless of case, add the terms in lowercase (such as hi-c). To annotate variations, add the variations as surface forms (MS-60-70 and MS 60 70).\n\nImportant: Do not use this approach if you are using the default tokenizer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo annotate entity mentions in a document:\n\n\n\n1.

If the volume that was created from snapshot is attached to an instance before its data is fully restored, volume hydration pauses on the service node and continues on the compute node. If the volume is detached while the hydration is in progress, the hydration pauses on compute node and continues on the storage node. You cannot delete a snapshot that is used to hydrate a volume. After the restoration process is complete, you can realize full IOPS on the new volume.\n\nVolumes that are restored from fast restore clones don't require hydration. The data is available as soon as the volume is created. However, to achieve the best performance and efficiency when you provision multiple instances, boot from an existing image. Custom images that you provide are better than stock images for this purpose. Images have a maximum size of 250 GB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Restoring a volume with fast restore", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore&interface=api"}]}

Fires on that scale are unusual, but not unique. As a business, should you spend time and money making sure that your computer systems could survive such a fire? The answer depends on various factors, but if for instance, your entire customer base is in Chicago, worrying about events that will wipe out the whole city is likely not useful. So it is worth thinking about what sorts of things might fail, how likely they are to happen, and how damaging they would be, before deciding what level of redundancy is appropriate.\n\n\n\n Geographic redundancy \n\nLevels of redundancy have both a technical and a geographic component. If you have two houses, are you more likely to become homeless if the houses are next door to each other or if they are in different countries? Similar considerations drive computer system redundancy, and are behind IBM\u00ae\u2019s use of local, regional, and global redundancy. Local redundancy duplicates some or all of a computer system in the same data center. This protects against many kinds of outages, but not all. Regional redundancy, as implemented by IBM, provides at least three copies of the system in three different data centers, so a single local event, like a large fire, is unlikely to take down all the systems. Global redundancy is available for customers that want to avoid outages that are caused by large regional events such as severe hurricanes and typhoons.\n\nZoom\n\n![Geographic levels of redundancy.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/adcecdbe4e86955f88aac7f3c1e7ec3ff44992ef/overview/images/geographic-redundancy.svg)\n\nFigure 2.

So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures. However, usually the combination of different services and data bridges requires high performance and flexible pipelines. Spanning from IoT devices up to cloud storage, and an analytics platform. Often pre-configured bridges lack the programmability to implement and fine-tune a particular solution architecture. Given the variety of pipelines, and the lack of standardization around data fusion in general (IoT in particular), it is common to see environments where the pipeline requires custom data transformation. These custom data transformations apply to format conversion, filtering, or augmentation. Cloud Functions is an excellent tool to implement such a transformation, in a serverless manner, where the custom logic is hosted on a fully managed and elastic cloud platform.\n\nLook at the following sample IoT application that uses Cloud Functions, Node-RED, Cognitive, and other services: [Serverless transformation of IoT data-in-motion with Cloud Functions](https://medium.com/openwhisk/serverless-transformation-of-iot-data-in-motion-with-openwhisk-272e36117d6c).\n\n\n\n\n\n API backend \n\nServerless computing platforms give developers a rapid way to build APIs without servers.

Your assistant remembers this information, and other information about a conversation, as variables. Your assistant can use variables to provide a more personalized and customized experience, and to get users quickly to the solutions they need.\n\nVariables are a powerful tool that you can use to build a better assistant. Variables make possible all of the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* Personalization. The best virtual assistant experiences are targeted and personalized for each customer. When an assistant greets a customer by saying \"Hello, Frank! Welcome back,\" it tells Frank that it remembers his name and that it has talked to him before. By storing this kind of information in variables and then referencing them in your assistant's output, you can personalize the conversation and help your assistant seem more human.\n* Acceleration. Over the course of a conversation, your customers answer questions and make choices. These customer responses are stored as variables, which your assistant can then use to guide a conversation. By choosing the right steps and not wasting your customers' time, you can get them as quickly as possible to the right solution.\n* Modularity. Some information might be useful for many different purposes (for example, a customer's current account balance or contact information).

For example, a variable that is called account_balance might store your customer's current account balance, a value your assistant can update or retrieve as needed.\n\nThe data that is stored by a variable is characterized by the type of data that it contains, such as text, a numeric value, a date, or even a list of multiple values.

This maintenance upgrades the software on the underlying hypervisor, update the firmware on the systems, or other security and performance updates. In general, users don't experience any issues during these upgrades. Modifications that require host maintenance are applied with no or little impact to running services in most cases. Scenarios can occur where the user is involved during maintenance operations, which are discussed in the [Possible impacts to virtual server instances during maintenance operations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-cloud-maintenancemaintenance-impacts) section.\n\nMost updates are done transparently to the host and the virtual servers that run on those hosts do not see any disruption.

Users don't generally experience any issues during data center maintenance. Examples of this maintenance can be updates to the network, power infrastructure, or server hardware in a data center.

These changes can be a firmware update, an event where the hypervisor kernel cannot be live patched, or load balancing. The regular live migration process is nondisruptive and use of dedicated hosts and virtual servers is not interrupted.\n\nWhen nondisruptive live migration occurs, the virtual server experiences a brief pause of around 10 seconds, and in some cases up to 30 seconds.

If you require virtual server placement, you need to provision them on dedicated hosts as dedicated host instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n What type of server, virtual or bare metal, supports the dedicated host offering? \n\nThe offering is supported on virtual servers; IBM Cloud does have a bare metal offering. The differences between virtual hosts and bare metal servers are the time to provision and virtualization management.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the provisioning lifecycle of a dedicated host? \n\nDedicated hosts are allocated to users when provisioned.

Hourly only hosts allow only hourly instances to be provisioned; monthly only hosts allow provisioning of monthly and hourly instances.

When a single set of prescriptive reference pipelines that are instrumented for compliance are used for all of the components across an organization, developers spend less time to develop automation solutions and can focus on feature development.

The standard offering is a public-based virtual server, which is a multi-tenant environment that is suitable for various needs. If you're looking for a single-tenant environment, consider the dedicated virtual server offering. The dedicated virtual server option is ideal for applications with more stringent resource requirements. For more information about the current virtual server offerings, see [Getting started with virtual servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-getting-started-tutorial).\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Servers for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the next generation of virtual servers. You create your own space in the IBM Cloud to run an isolated environment within the public cloud by using VPC. IBM Cloud VPC provides the security of a private cloud with the agility and ease of a public cloud. For more information, see [About virtual server instances for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-advanced-virtual-servers).\n\n\n\n\n\n Where can I find pricing information for public instance types? \n\nFor more information, see [Build your virtual server](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/virtual-servers).\n\n\n\n\n\n Where can I find pricing information for virtual public instances? \n\nEstimating your cost for an IBM Cloud server to support your workload begins in the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog).

This result can be catastrophic if any or all of the virtual servers are deployed on the same hypervisor. A hardware or software failure can cause a disruption.\n\nIBM Cloud provides two solutions to help avoid virtual servers from deploying on the same hypervisor.\n\n\n\n1.  Use a dedicated virtual server. By using a dedicated virtual server, you to own the entire hypervisor and control the placement of the virtual servers. For more information, see [About dedicated virtual servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-dedicated-virtual-servers)\n2.  Use Placement Groups. Placement Groups is an anti-affinity feature. If virtual servers are marked in the same placement group, then these virtual servers are instantiated across different hypervisors. By putting the virtual servers in placement groups, availability is improved.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload. Priority classes can help you control the Red Hat OpenShift controller decisions to favor higher priority pods over lower priority pods. The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs). Access policies and SCCs can help prevent untrusted users from deploying high priority pods that prevent other pods from scheduling.\n\nHow does priority scheduling and preemption work?\n\nIn general, pending pods that have a higher priority are scheduled before lower prioritized pods. If you don't have enough resources remaining in your worker nodes, the Red Hat OpenShift controller can preempt (remove) pods to free up enough resources for the higher prioritized pods to be scheduled.

Create the infrastructure \n\n\n\n1. Create all the infrastructure that you need by running the Terraform script:\n\nterraform apply --auto-approve\n\nThe Terraform folder contains a number of simple scripts, which you can see in the following list:\n\nmain.tf\n: Tells Terraform to use the IBM Cloud.\n\nvariables.tf\n: Contains the variable definitions whose values are populated from terraform.tfvars.\n\nredis.tf\n: Creates a Databases for Redis instance and some credentials to access it.\n\ncloudant.tf\n: Creates an IBM Cloudant free-tier instance and some credentials to access it.\n\nIt takes several minutes for the resources to be ready. Now you have an IBM Cloudant instance and a Databases for Redis instance that you can access.\n\nYou can have only one free-tier instance per account. If you already have one, you must delete it, or change the plan variable to standard.\n2. Check out these instances by visiting the Resources section of your IBM Cloud\u00ae account.\n\n\n\nThe Terraform script outputs several bits of information that you use in the next steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4. Run the service \n\nIn this step, you run a script that creates all the environment variables that your service needs and then runs the service.\n\nIn the terminal, type the following command:\n\n./build.sh\n\nWhen you run this script, it takes the data output from the Terraform script and uses the jq facility to parse the content and create the environment variables needed. It then runs the script (server.js) that initializes the database and populates it with data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 5. Visit your website \n\n\n\n1. Open a browser and visit https://localhost:8080.

After the NS Records are DNS propagated, it is reflected in the DNS tools, and you are ready to proceed.\n13. With completed NS propagation, click Check name servers.\n14. CIS starts checking NS configuration for the subdomain and might be in a Pending State.\n\nAny typographical errors in can produce a \"silent\" failure. If your subdomain is in the pending state for more than 30 minutes, you might have an error.\n\n\n\nUpon successful subdomain name server and NS record confirmation, the CIS instance reports Active.

It's also worth checking to see if any IPs in these ranges are blocked.\n\n522 errors can also be caused by network connectivity issues, so confirm that your server and network is generally healthy and not overloaded.\n\nIf after taking the above steps you still receive errors, contact IBM CIS support and confirm the following:\n\n\n\n* You've allowlisted our IP ranges\n* Your server/network is online and generally healthy\n\n\n\nIf you contact our support team, please provide a Ray ID from a recent 522 error.

As a result, you must have a proxied DNS record for your zone.\n* Can I add a CNAME for a root record?\n\nYes. IBM CIS supports a feature called \"CNAME Flattening\" which allows our users to add a CNAME as a root record.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15141-7808-9997", "score": 19.247074747832187, "text": "\nTransport layer protocols act as liaisons between the application layer protocols and the services that are provided by the network. Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel). When the traffic is split between the VPN interface and other interfaces, split tunneling is said to be in use.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-vpn-planning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04107-6095-8145", "score": 18.687853780859914, "text": "\nThis tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again.

This allows CIS to ingest, single-pass inspect, and re-encrypt data before sending it to the origin server destination. CIS can also act in DNS-only mode, returning the actual DNS record without obfuscating the IP, which disables DDoS and the other functions of CIS. To enable CIS protections, switch the \"proxy\" slider next to each DNS record to on; to disable protections, switch to off.\n\n\n\n\n\n Unlimited DDoS mitigation \n\nDDoS mitigation is typically an expensive service that can grow in cost when under attack. Unlimited DDoS mitigation is included with CIS at no additional cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n Mitigate Layer 7 attacks (configuration) \n\nThough DDoS is enabled by default in CIS, you can further configure Layer 7 security by:\n\n\n\n* Configuring WAF ruleset sensitivity and response behavior\n* Adding rate limiting\n* Adding firewall rules\n\n\n\nUse these features to customize Layer 7 mitigation of both volumetric and non-volumetric attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n Mitigate non volumetric attacks \n\nCIS WAF contains rulesets to mitigate non-volumetric attacks, including cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection.

You can merge it into your configuration by running:\n\nvyatta@vrouter merge /opt/vyatta/etc/cpp.conf\n\nAfter this rule set is merged, a new firewall rule set named CPP is added and applied to the loopback interface.

In zone-based firewall operation an interface is assigned to a zone (only one zone per interface) and firewall rule sets are assigned to the boundaries between zones with the idea that all interfaces within a zone have the same security level and are allowed to route freely. Traffic is only scrutinized when it is passing from one zone to another. Zones drop any traffic coming into them which is not explicitly allowed.\n\nAn interface can either belong to a zone or have a per-interface firewall configuration; an interface cannot do both.\n\nImagine the following office scenario with three departments, each department with its own VLAN:\n\n\n\n* Department A - VLANs 10 and 20 (interface dp0bond1.10 and dp0bond1.20)\n* Department B - VLANs 30 and 40 (interface dp0bond1.30 and dp0bond1.40)\n* Department C - VLAN 50 (interface dp0bond1.50)\n\n\n\nA zone can be created for each department and the interfaces for that department can be added to the zone.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

For the created objects in Object Storage, the question arises if this operation is transaction safe and ACID compliant? In other words, if you create an object in Object Storage by using Data Engine, can you assume that this creation is transaction safe? If anything happens before the creation is done, it is rolled back?\n\nThe answer is IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage does not support transactions. However, an object is rolled back if you create it with a single SQL query job on a nonpartitioned object on Object Storage because Object Storage itself does object write in an atomic fashion. If you want to write complex hierarchies of objects with a single SQL job, two scenarios can happen: 1) the job fails half way through and only part of the objects are written, or 2) during job execution some objects are already visible while others are still in process to be written. For the latter scenario, use Hive-style partitioned tables, which means that the SQL job writes a new set of objects into a new Object Storage prefix location. This method does not affect anything in the Hive-style partitioned table. Only when you then also issue an ALTER TABLE \u2026 ADD PARTITION with the newly written object location, the data is made available in the Hive-style partitioned table. That ALTER TABLE DDL is in fact also an atomic operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n How to handle large time series data sets? \n\nWhen you use time-series queries, in general, the more time series that exist, the better the parallelism.\n\nThe following example query creates one time series per key, and partitions the data based on the key. Anytime a query is run against \"ts\", it is run in parallel across time series.\n\nselect\nkey,\nts\nfrom table\nusing time_series_format(key=\"key\", timetick=\"time_tick\", value=\"amount\") in ts\n\nThe issue arises if \"ts\" is large and thus does not fit in the memory of one machine. To mitigate this issue, modify your key as follows.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-faq"}]}

The duration of the outage depends on the time that it takes to update the weak ciphers and to reestablish the VPN connection. It is recommended that you plan a maintenance window for this upgrade.\n\nBefore you begin, it is a good idea to first configure your on-prem VPN gateway peer to contain both the weak and secure ciphers for Phase 1 and Phase 2 negotiation. Then, change the IBM VPN gateway to remove the use of the weak ciphers by following these steps. Afterward, remove the weak ciphers from the on-prem VPN gateway. This step might also reduce the outage time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Upgrading a VPN from a custom IKE policy in the UI \n\nTo upgrade the IKE policy by using the UI, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

For more information, see the [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2message).\n* If you use the stateless v2 message API (or the legacy v1 message API) your application is responsible for storing the context after each conversation turn and sending it back to the service with the next message.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages.

Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Adding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03027-4976-6968", "score": 24.04242843512782, "text": "\nEnglish (en) GA Deprecated \n Arabic (ar) GA Deprecated \n Chinese (Simplified) (zh-cn) GA Deprecated \n Chinese (Traditional) (zh-tw) GA Deprecated \n Czech (cs) GA Deprecated \n Dutch (nl) GA Deprecated \n French (fr) GA Deprecated \n German (de) GA Deprecated \n Italian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English. All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing a skill language \n\nOnce a skill has been created, its language cannot be modified. If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03027-7-1946", "score": 24.0279182231382, "text": "\nSupported languages \n\nWatson Assistant supports individual features to varying degrees per language.\n\nWatson Assistant has classifier models that are designed specifically to support conversational skills in the following languages:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

The false value means that all available shard replicas are queried and IBM Cloudant uses the fastest response. By contrast, setting stable=true forces the database to use just one replica of the index.\n\nUsing stable=true can cause high latency as it consults only one of the copies of the index, even if the other copies would respond faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n Combining parameters \n\nIf you specify stable=false and update=false, you see greater inconsistency between results, even for the same query and without making database changes. We recommend against this combination unless you are sure that your system can tolerate this behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sorting returned rows \n\nThe data that is returned by a view query is in the form of an array. Each element within the array is sorted by using standard [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) sorting.

IBM Cloudant Query supports sorting the result set in ascending or descending order, but not a combination of the two. For example, a query that sorts some fields in ascending order, and a query where descending is not allowed.\n\nThis query returns documents that match firstname and surname and sorts by surname/firstname/date descending:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"sort\": [\n{ \"firstname\": \"desc\" },\n{ \"surname\": \"desc\" },\n{ \"date\": \"desc\" }\n],\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nA suitable index must be present that contains the selector fields and the sort fields.

You can verify if a cluster does or does not use a system channel by clicking the cluster's tile and looking near the Orderer Type text.\n\nJoining an orderer to an application channel will make it either a follower or a consenter. It will be a consenter if the node is found in the the channel's config block in the consenters section. Otherwise the orderer will be a follower. Both types of orderers will receive transaction/block data, but only a consenter can vote and play a role in the consensus algorithm. A node can be promoted from a follower to a consenter by first joining it to the channel, and then editing the channel's config to add it as a consenter. Similarly these steps can be reversed to demote an orderer and unjoin it completely if need be.\n\nJoining an orderer to the application channel can be started by clicking the cluster's tile. Next click either the plus sign on a channel tile or the Join channel blue button. Follow the prompts and select which orderer nodes to join. Then click Submit. Once an orderer has joined it will begin downloading blocks to catch up to the current level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removing ordering service nodes \n\nIf a user wants to delete an ordering node, it must first remove the node from all channels where it is a consenter. This is because the console does not distinguish between a deleted node and an unavailable node, and will keep an ordering node as part of its consenter set until it is removed.\n\nAs a result, when you delete a node, a check is performed to see if it is a consenter on any channels. If it is, you will not be able to delete the node until it has been removed as a consenter from all channels. After removing the node as a consenter from all channels, you will be able to delete the node by clicking the trash can icon. Note that this action will have to be taken in the console where the node was created.\n\nAs part of this same process, make sure to reach out to the other console operators to let them know that the node has been deleted so they can remove the tile from their console.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-add-remove-orderer"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00644-22813-24283", "score": 18.03317845288514, "text": "\n\"allusers\",\n\"getVerifiedEmails\",\n)\n\npostViewOptions.SetDescending(true)\npostViewOptions.StartKey = \"alpha\"\npostViewOptions.EndKey = \"beta\"\n\nviewResult, response, err := service.PostView(postViewOptions)\nif err != nil {\npanic(err)\n}\n\nb, _ := json.MarshalIndent(viewResult, \"\", \" \")\nfmt.Println(string(b))\n\nThe previous Go example requires the following import block:\n\nimport (\n\"encoding/json\"\n\"fmt\"\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nAll Go examples require the service object to be initialized.

Envelope encryption involves encrypting your data with a Data Encryption Key, then encrypting the Data Encryption Key with a root key. This topic describes the process of envelope encryption and how to use Key Protect to encrypt and decrypt your data.\n\nWhen working with sensitive data, it is important to use advanced encryption techniques to prevent a data breach. If you have large amounts of confidential data, it is often helpful to use a Key Management System to assist in keeping your data secure. Key Protect uses the envelope encryption technique to keep your data resilient. Envelope encryption is the process of using encrypted keys, Data Encryption Keys and Root Keys, to protect your sensitive data.\n\nImagine that you plan to send a letter to a colleague. You want to discuss information that is highly sensitive, so you generate a secret code (Data Encryption Key) that is used to write (encrypt) the message in the letter. The letter is delivered to a mailbox (wrapped Data Encryption Key) that can only be opened by those with a copy of the mailbox key (Root key), including the colleague. Anyone who does not have an exact copy of the key will be unable to open the mailbox and see it's contents. When your colleague uses the key to unlock (unencrypt) the mailbox, they will need to know the secret code that the letter is written in to be able to understand the message. Everyone who is not aware of the secret code will conclude that the letter is a random mix of characters and will not be able to understand the letter's contents.\n\nData encryption keys (DEKs) are designed to encrypt your data and can be generated and managed by your service or an IBM Cloud service.\n\nEnvelope encryption offers several benefits for protecting your data:\n\n\n\n* Protection under a combination of multiple algorithms Envelope encryption uses the best benefits from symmetric and public key algorithms to keep your keys secure.\n\n\n\n1.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16035-4222-6333", "score": 10.941095075108676, "text": "\n[File shares](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-encryption) provide a customer-managed encryption option similar to Block Storage for VPC volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n Advantages of customer-managed encryption \n\nCustomer-managed encryption has several advantages over IBM-managed encryption.\n\nYou control your keys:\n\n\n\n* Because you bring your own keys (BYOK) to the cloud, you control encryption of your Block Storage for VPC volumes, file shares, and custom images.\n* You grant the IBM VPC service access to use your root keys to encrypt your data.

When your instance is shut down or deleted, the underlying storage space is erased and unrecoverable. At that point, the data is unrecoverable. For more information, see [Introduction to encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-basics).\n\nData is automatically encrypted on the physical media at the drive level.

You can use the /dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the /dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

You can optionally include a message that summarizes the user's issue to be provided to the human agent. It is the responsibility of the external service to display a message that is shown to the user that explains that the conversation is being transferred. The dialog does not manage that communication itself. The dialog transfer does not occur when you are testing nodes with this response type in the Try it out pane.

The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options.

For example, you might set up an intent called buy_takeout in the dialog, and that intent calls the order pizza action. This conversation topic is listed as buy_takeout > order pizza in the Topics column.\n\nYou might also see Dialog called action listed in the Requests column next to a conversation. In this case, customer input triggered an intent.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application.

The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system.

By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy /message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

Therefore, it is required that you export the identities from the wallet in your private browser session to your file system.

If you associated an identity without administrative privilege on the ordering service node, you will not be able to view or manage ordering service details.\n\n Why it\u2019s happening \n\nThis problem can be caused by a [bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1006243) introduced by the Chrome browser Version 77.0.3865.90 (Official Build) (64-bit) that causes actions from the browser to fail.\n\n How to fix it \n\nTo resolve this problem, open the console in a new browser tab in Chrome.

Peers and ordering nodes take longer to deploy, but this condition can also occur when the health checker that runs against the peer or ordering nodes cannot contact the node.

For more information, see [Language model support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-inputdetection-support).\n\n\n\n How speech activity detection works \n\nSpeech activity detection consumes the input audio stream and determines which parts of the stream to pass for speech recognition. Speech recognition is adversely affected by background speech and noise, causing the service to transcribe the wrong words, to produce words where none are present, or to omit words that are part of the input audio. The speech activity detection feature can help ensure that only relevant audio is processed for speech recognition.\n\nYou can use the feature to control the following aspects of speech recognition:\n\n\n\n* Suppress background speech. Call-center data often contains cross-talk (\"overhearing\") from other agents. You can set a volume threshold below which such background speech is ignored.\n* Suppress background noise. Some audio, such as speech recorded in a factory, can contain a high level of background noise. You can set a threshold below which such background noise is ignored.\n* Suppress non-speech audio events. Background music and tone events, such as audio played to a client who is waiting on hold on a telephone line, can cause inaccurate recognition. Silence can also result in unnecessary recognition or transcription errors. You can set a threshold below which such events are ignored.\n\n\n\nBy default, speech activity detection is configured to provide optimal performance for the general case for each model. For specific cases, the default settings might not be optimal and can lead either to slow transcription or to word insertions and deletions. You are encouraged to experiment with different settings to determine which values work best for your audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity \n\nUse the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter to adjust the sensitivity of speech activity detection.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-192793-195089", "score": 19.1123720665758, "text": "\nThe name you specify is saved as a title attribute of the node in the workspace JSON file and the system uses a unique ID that is stored in the name attribute to reference the node.\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 August 2017 \n\nUpdates to Korean, Japanese, and Italian\n: Language support has been enhanced for Korean, Japanese, and Italian. Note that the Watson Assistant service learning models may have been updated as part of this enhancement, and when you retrain your model any changes will be applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 August 2017 \n\nAccent normalization\n: In a conversational setting, users may or may not use accents while interacting with the Watson Assistant service. As such, an update has been made to the algorithm so that accented and non-accented versions of words are treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever, for some languages like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word barri\u00f3, which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb barrer (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word barrio (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as u\u00f1a vs. una. In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.\n\nNote: Accent normalization is enabled for Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Czech.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16356-1613-3336", "score": 18.979940799633763, "text": "\nFor more information about the Fallback action, see [Editing the fallback action](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-handle-errorsfallback-action).\n\n\n\n\n\n Show warning \n\nThe second and final step of the Trigger word detected action is the Show warning step. The Show warning step shows a customizable warning message to your customer if any trigger words are detected in the customer's input. Use this step to discourage customers from interacting with your assistant in unacceptable ways, such as using profanity.\n\nFor example, you might add darn, dang, and heck as trigger words for the Show warning step:\n\nZoom\n\n![Adding trigger words to the Show warning step](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/show-warning-phrases.png)\n\nAdding trigger words to the Show warning step\n\nIn this example, a customer enters darn, dang, or heck, the assistant responds with Please use appropriate language when interacting with the assistant.

However, the replacement worker node is assigned a new private IP address, and loses any custom labels or taints that you applied to the old worker node (worker pool labels and taints are still applied to the replacement worker node).\n\nWhat if I replace multiple worker nodes at the same time?\n: If you replace multiple worker nodes at the same time, they are deleted and replaced concurrently, not one by one. Make sure that you have enough capacity in your cluster to reschedule your workloads before you replace worker nodes.\n\nWhat if a replacement worker node is not created?\n: A replacement worker node is not created if the worker pool does not have [automatic rebalancing enabled](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-auto-rebalance-off).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10290-114867-116840", "score": 11.551443554240743, "text": "\nTo update Satellite worker nodes, see [Updating hosts that are assigned as worker nodes to Satellite-enabled services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-update-workers).\n\n\n\n* Multiple worker nodes are replaced concurrently: If you replace multiple worker nodes at the same time, they are deleted and replaced concurrently, not one by one. Make sure that you have enough capacity in your cluster to reschedule your workloads before you replace worker nodes.\n* Node-level customizations are not preserved: Any custom labels or taints that you applied at the individual worker node level are not applied to the replacement worker node. Instead, apply [labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-add_workersworker_pool_labels) or [taints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cliworker_pool_taint) at the worker pool level so that the replacement worker node gets these attributes.\n* Automatic rebalancing: A replacement worker node is not created if the worker pool does not have [automatic rebalancing enabled](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-auto-rebalance-off).\n\n\n\nBefore you begin, make sure that your cluster has enough other worker nodes so that your pods can be rescheduled and continue to run.\n\n\n\n1.

The IBM Cloud Kubernetes service uses a tiered pricing model that is visible in IBM Cloud when you provision your paid cluster. This includes the charges for your compute, that is, CPU and memory. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Services are priced on a tiered model that is based on the number of hours of usage per month. Therefore, when you examine pricing plans, consider that 24x7 usage is equivalent to 720 hours per month. Refer to the table on the [Kubernetes Service Catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/about) for more details on cluster pricing. Customers who are interested in pricing OpenShift clusters can review [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Pricing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift/pricing).\n* Storage: Choose the storage plan that works for your needs.

The alt_disk_mksysb command copies the mksysb archive onto a new volume. The alt_disk_mksysb command also gives you the option of rebooting from a specific disk image.\n\nBefore you can copy an AIX mksysb archive, determine the amount of space the helper VM needs to hold the mksysb image. In the following example, the mksysb image (gdrh10v1.sysb) is roughly 5.8 GB. Determining the space needed as follow:\n\n:>ls -l gdrh10v1.sysb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root system 5806899200 Jul 18 2017 gdrh10v1.sysb\n\nNext, you must identify a helper VM file system with enough space to hold the mksysb image. If such a file system does not exist, you can attach a data volume as a staging area. To display information about a volume group, use the lsvg command.\n\n lsvg rootvg\nVOLUME GROUP: rootvg VG IDENTIFIER: 00f6db0a00004c000000016b94f02\nVG STATE: active PP SIZE: 32 megabyte(s)\nVG PERMISSION: read/write TOTAL PPs: 639 (20448 megabytes)\nMAX LVs: 256 FREE PPs: 477 (15264 megabytes)\nLVs: 12 USED PPs: 162 (5184 megabytes)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-restoring-aix-mksysb-image"}]}

See [What is an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) for more details about how enterprises can help you centrally manage billing and usage.\n\n\n\n Enterprise billing model \n\nIn an enterprise, billing is managed by the enterprise rather than in the individual child accounts. This centralized billing model differs from a stand-alone account in the following ways.\n\n\n\n* Credit from any existing subscriptions or promotions in accounts that are added to the enterprise is consolidated into the enterprise's credit pool. The billing administrator adds new subscriptions to the credit pool from the enterprise account.\n* Usage from all accounts is deducted from the shared credit pool. If given access, enterprise users can view usage costs for all accounts and account groups in the enterprise. Users within each child account can continue to monitor usage in the particular account, but they don't have visibility to other accounts in the enterprise.\n* Usage is invoiced through the enterprise account. Only the enterprise billing administrator can view invoices and manage payments.\n\n\n\nZoom\n\n![A diagram that shows that credit from accounts is added to the enterprise credit pool, which is managed by the billing administrator in the enterprise account.

When you assign a user an Enterprise account management service policy within a child account in an enterprise, the user can't manage the enterprise to which the account belongs. Depending on the assigned role for the Enterprise account management service in the enterprise account, the user can perform specific actions:\n\n\n\n* Create new accounts in the enterprise\n* Create and name account groups\n* Move accounts between account groups\n* Import existing accounts to the enterprise\n* Update the enterprise name or domain\n* View usage reports for the enterprise, a specific account group, accounts within account groups, or a specific account\n\n\n\nA policy that gives a user access to the enterprise service can either be assigned on the entire enterprise or only on a specific account group or single account.\n\nTypically, the enterprise account itself doesn't contain many resources. Instead, resources are created in the child accounts of the enterprise. It is within each of these accounts that users can be invited and given access to manage and work with resources. The access and membership that a user has in the enterprise account does not apply to the account groups and child accounts in the enterprise hierarchy. User management and access management remain isolated to each account as you can see depicted in the following diagrams.\n\nThe first diagram shows how you can assign a policy to a user in the enterprise account to manage the entire enterprise. The second diagram shows a policy that is scoped to an account group that provides access to manage only that account group and the child accounts that are organized within it.\n\nZoom\n\n![Enterprise access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/d4595e5202a9a27767cf034e81b038cdf772e0d5/secure-enterprise/images/enterprise-access.svg)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-assign-access-enterprise"}]}

Following are the three key concepts in RAID:\n\n\n\n* Mirroring: copying data to more than one disk\n* Striping: splitting data across more than one disk\n* Error correction (fault tolerance): redundant data is stored to allow problems to be detected and possibly fixed.\n\n\n\nAlthough many different levels of RAID exist, IBM chooses to support the most common RAID types: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity / Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05138-7979-9034", "score": 21.25385124092189, "text": "\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}]}

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word \u201cimmutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption.

So, in a scenario in which these DB configs are not stored properly or the service that they stored in is compromised, what we ultimately get is a pretty catastrophic scenario for the provider, because the provider of this service of this lending application then has to go and tell its customer that a bad actor was able to take advantage of access that it got wrongfully to its DB config. And, that DB config ultimately allowed that bad actor to steal their data and do whatever they wanted with it against that customer.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04111-35313-36062", "score": 20.22126061362581, "text": "\nGet Bot Management settings.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers.

As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 22.439874944564654, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 22.3383281176868, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action. Enter (cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed) into the Expression preview section as a singular rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations \n\n\n\n* If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n\n\n\n* Ensure that anything under /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/ is allowed.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-javascript-detections"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04111-34153-35639", "score": 18.52922048800587, "text": "\nGET /v1/{crn}/zones/{domain_id}/setting/origin_error_page_pass_thru internet-svcs.zones.update internet-svcs.origin-error-page-pass-thru-setting.update \n Get brotli compression settings.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-4-2366", "score": 35.74146097124232, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry. Vulnerability Advisor checks the security status of container images that are provided by IBM, third parties, or added to your organization's registry namespace.\n\nVulnerability Advisor provides security management for [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-startedgetting-started). Vulnerability Advisor generates a security status report that includes suggested fixes and best practices. Vulnerability Advisor is available in two versions: version 3 and version 4. Version 4 uses new architecture and a different scanning engine.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023. For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-3131-4993", "score": 39.65449502355515, "text": "\n* Applies exemption policies to reports at an account, [namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_namespace), [repository](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_repository), or [tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_tag) level to mark when issues that are flagged do not apply to your use case.\n\n\n\nThe following functions are available in version 4:\n\n\n\n* Scans images for issues.\n* Provides an evaluation report that is based on security practices that are specific to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n* Provides instructions about how to fix a reported [vulnerable package](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexpackages) in its reports.\n* Applies exemption policies to reports at an account, [namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_namespace), [repository](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_repository), or [tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_tag) level to mark when issues that are flagged do not apply to your use case.\n\n\n\nThe Security status column in the Images tab of the Container Registry dashboard displays the number of issues that are associated with each image.

When specified in combination with PARTITIONED INTO, the same is done, which is often referred to as clustering the rows by the specified columns into the fixed number of partitions specified by PARTITIONED INTO. When specified without the PARTITIONED clause, it is equivalent to an ORDER BY clause specified at the top level of the SQL SELECT statement. If PARTITIONED INTO is specified, the ORDER BY clause is ignored.\n\n\n\n Partition by columns \n\nWhen you use the PARTITIONED BY (column-list) clause without specifying INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS, you can store the query result by using Hive-style partitioning, which is to create partitions that contain only rows that have certain values for one or more columns. Choose this physical layout if the stored object is further analyzed by using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.\n\nFor example, a result object that contains worldwide order data has a column country to represent the country that the order is initiated from. Partitioning the result object by the column PARTITIONED BY (country), would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.\n\nWhen the result object is stored this way on Cloud Object Storage, each SQL query that contains a predicate, such as country = 'USA' or country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY'), benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during SQL query execution partitions must be read only if they contain data for the countries of interest. This layout tremendously cuts down the I/O traffic of the SQL query.\n\nSee the following extra remarks on Hive-style partitioning.\n\n\n\n* Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme because the column names that are used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, /order/COUNTRY=USA/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet.\n* Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are stored in the object prefix of the partition.

This statement allows an optional search filter to limit the number of results:\n\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'cus'\n\nIt is not possible to use a different namespace than default.\n\nTo clean up catalog entries for unused data, use the DROP TABLE statement.

The naming of the objects must adhere to the Hive-style partition naming convention: The object names must include the structure /columm=value/. The column must be a column name that is included in the schema definition of the CREATE TABLE statement.

By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

They\u2019ll help you prevent any issues with API or HTTPS traffic, and help your logs capture the correct IP addresses of your customers, rather than the protective CIS IP addresses.\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to set up:\n\n\n\n* Restore the originating IPs of your customers\n* Incorporate CIS IP addresses\n* Make sure your security settings don't interfere with API traffic\n* Configure your security settings as strictly as possible\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 1: Know how to restore the originating IPs of your customers \n\nAs a reverse proxy, CIS provides the origination IP in these headers:\n\n\n\n* CF-Connecting-IP\n* X-Forwarded-For\n* True-Client-IP (optional)\n\n\n\nYou can restore user IP addresses using a variety of tools, for infrastructures such as Apache, Windows IIS, and NGINX.\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: Incorporate CIS IP addresses to make integration smoother \n\nHere are the two steps to take:\n\n\n\n* Remove any rate limiting of CIS IP addresses\n* Set up your ACLs to allow only CIS IP addresses and other trusted parties\n\n\n\nYou can find the updated list of IP ranges for IBM CIS [at this location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-cis-allowlisted-ip-addresses).\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 3: Review your security settings to make sure they don\u2019t interfere with API traffic \n\nIBM CIS usually accelerates API traffic by removing connection overhead. However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14710-7-1982", "score": 12.171077062260988, "text": "\nVeeam backup proxy \n\nA backup proxy is a Veeam\u00ae component that sits between the backup server and other components of the backup infrastructure.

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more.

Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second.

When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07067-26099-28206", "score": 13.305914496840167, "text": "\nIf false, ranks the passages from all of the documents by passage quality regardless of the document quality and returns them in a separate passages field in the response.\n* When passages are returned for a query, you can also enable answer finding.

Or, if you prefer, you can connect the assistant to your existing infrastructure by configuring an existing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk.\n\nA SIP trunk is equivalent to an analog telephone line, except it uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to transmit voice data and can support multiple concurrent calls. The trunk can connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or your company's on-premises private branch exchange (PBX). If you choose to generate a free phone number for your assistant, a SIP trunk is automatically provisioned from IntelePeer. You can also choose to use an existing SIP trunk from a provider such as IntelePeer, Genesys, or Twilio.\n\nGenerating a free phone number is available only with new phone integrations. If you have an existing phone integration and you want to switch to a free phone number, you must delete the existing integration and create a new one.\n\nWhen your customer makes a phone call using the telephone number connected to your assistant, the phone integration answers. The integration converts output from your assistant into voice audio by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service. The audio is sent to the telephone network through the SIP trunk.

A reverse DNS lookup program inputs IP addresses of incoming messages to a DNS database. If no valid name is found to match the IP address, the server blocks the message. Reverse DNS is also used for things like network troubleshooting calls (such as ping) and for network monitoring tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Secondary domains \n\nA secondary domain is a domain that IBM Cloud DNS servers transfer from your server to our authoritative DNS servers, ns1.softlayer.com and ns2.softlayer.com.\n\nTo set up a secondary domain, you need three pieces of information: the domain, the IP address of the master DNS server we're transferring from and how often, in minutes, you'd like the domain transferred.\n\nAfter a secondary domain is configured, you'll have the ability to change the master server's IP address and the transfer interval.

The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step.

An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running. You can develop and deploy Spark SQL, data transformation, data science, or machine learning jobs using the Spark application API.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the advantages of IBM Analytics Engine serverless instances? \n\nWith IBM Analytics Engine serverless, compute and memory resources are allocated on demand when Spark workloads are deployed. When an application is not in running state, no computing resources are allocated to the IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the instance, billed on a per second basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark support Hadoop? \n\nNo, currently, the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark only supports Apache Spark.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change the instance home storage of a serverless instance? \n\nNo, you can't. After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries. Changing instance home would result in the loss of the Spark history data and custom libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is user management and access control managed in a serverless instance? \n\nUser management and access control of an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance and its APIs is done through IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM). You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges. See [Granting permissions to users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I define the size of the cluster to run my Spark application? \n\nYou can specify the size of the cluster either at the time the instance is created or when submitting Spark applications.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-faqs-serverless"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-107943-110247", "score": 18.062634717838428, "text": "\n* Port 8443 Knox\n* Port 22 SSH\n* Port 9443 Ambari\n\n\n\n* What is IBM Analytics Engine serverless?\n\nThe IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark offers a new consumption model using Apache Spark.

This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.  In the Query workspace page, enter the query and click Run on starter to get the results.\n2.

This step is necessary, as the client is loaded into an isolated classloader to avoid version conflicts. Note that in the examples the files are placed in /tmp/dataengine, when you use a different folder, adjust the example accordingly.\n\nThe client differs from the Hive version 3.1.2 release by more enhancements that add support for TLS and authentication through IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

As you complete the ordering form, cost estimates appear in the Summary side panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n In terms of cost, what do I pay for? \n\nThere are two pricing plans: metered and unmetered. Metered has a port fee and bill per GB egressed across the Direct Link. Unmetered billing has a higher port fee and no usage charges, which are ideal for customers who consistently egress traffic across their direct link.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change billing options after my direct link is provisioned? \n\nYes, you can change billing options after a direct link is provisioned, regardless of whether you chose global or local routing. For example, to change from metered to unmetered billing, navigate to the Details page of the direct link and click Edit. In the side panel, select Unmetered in the Billing section, review the updated information, then agree to the prerequisites and click Submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n When does billing begin with Direct Link? \n\nThe fees for Direct Link cover the cost of service termination on the IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nInfrastructure services are billed in advance and begin upon acceptance of a client\u2019s order. However, due to the nature of IBM Cloud Direct Link, the Direct Link service billing begins when a BGP session is established with IBM Cloud, or 30 days after the order is submitted.\n\nBilling stops after (1) you request a circuit to be deleted, and (2) the provider has de-provisioned the circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n What extra charges will I incur from other parties with Direct Link? \n\nYou might have extra charges from your provider. See to your carrier or service provider for their fee information.\n\n\n\n* Where do I find cost estimates for Direct Link offerings?\n\n Where do I find cost estimates for Direct Link offerings? \n\nYou can estimate the cost of a service using the cost estimator on the provisioning pages for Direct Link offerings.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11857-1988-2975", "score": 22.07553486578992, "text": "\nSatellite-enabled IBM Cloud services \n\nEach IBM Cloud service instance that you create in your Satellite location incurs charges.

If you delete an App Configuration instance mid-month, the monthly Application Instance charge is pro-rated. To predict month instance cost, you must be aware of the number of App Configuration instances you have and what pricing plan is assigned to each.\n\nSee all your existing instances in the IBM Cloud Console Resource List in the Services Section. Determine your plan either by clicking the Resource List row that contains your App Configuration instance to reveal an information slide-out, or go to the instance dashboard and look in the Plan section.\n\nSome App Configuration pricing plans have a monthly Application Instance price and others do not.

Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.\n* Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing your payments \n\nIf you're a new Pay-As-You-Go account owner that is located in the US and you are paying with a credit card, you can replace your current card with a new one or edit the details of an existing card.

The provisioned throughput capacity is a reserved number of reads per second, writes per second, and global queries per second allocated to an instance. The throughput capacity setting is the maximum usage level for a given second.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricing).\n\n\n\n  Can I change my capacity setting? \n\nYou can change your provisioned throughput capacity and see your current capacity settings in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. Launch IBM Cloudant Dashboard > Account > Capacity to view and change your provisioned throughput capacity and see the hourly and approximate monthly costs. You can also use the IBM Cloud\u00ae pricing calculator to see estimates in other currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How do I know I exceeded the capacity limit that I set? \n\nThe Lite plan includes 1 GB of storage. If you exceed the limit, IBM Cloudant blocks your account from writing new data until you delete enough data to be under the 1-GB limit, or upgrade to a higher plan.\n\nThe first 20 GB of storage comes free with the Standard plan. You can store as much data as you want. Any storage over the 20 GB limit costs $0.0014 per GB per hour, which is approximately $1 per GB per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Where can I see my usage data? \n\nYou can see your current and historical usage bills in the IBM Cloud Dashboard. Go to Manage > Billing and usage > Usage. Here you can see the total charges and usage for the month by service, plan, or instance. Only the hourly costs that are accrued for the current month and time are available. At the end of the month, you can see the average provisioned throughput capacity for each field: LOOKUPS_PER_MONTH, WRITES_PER_MONTH, and QUERIES_PER_MONTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-pricing"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12858-2498-4217", "score": 26.965279083775158, "text": "\nIf you need help with selecting the UNSPSC for your service, see [How to select UNSPSC codes?](https://help.ungm.org/hc/en-us/articles/360013132940-How-to-select-UNSPSC-codes-) to find the one that applies to your product.

If you delete an App Configuration instance mid-month, the monthly Application Instance charge is pro-rated. To predict month instance cost, you must be aware of the number of App Configuration instances you have and what pricing plan is assigned to each.\n\nSee all your existing instances in the IBM Cloud Console Resource List in the Services Section. Determine your plan either by clicking the Resource List row that contains your App Configuration instance to reveal an information slide-out, or go to the instance dashboard and look in the Plan section.\n\nSome App Configuration pricing plans have a monthly Application Instance price and others do not. If the plan you select has an instance price, the price for the instance includes a set number of entity IDs and API calls that are included in the instance price. If you exceed the included allotment, your instance continues to operate normally but you accumulate an overage charge based on the published rate for entity IDs and API calls.\n\nThe Active Entity ID cost is based on the number of unique entities that interact with your App Configuration instance during the month.

For these interactions to be verifiable (to ensure, in other words, who is who) requires identities and a system of permissions that can be checked during each interaction. You can think of the kind of identity that is needed as being similar to a credit card in that it identifies someone within a particular context. Credit cards identify an individual in terms of banking transactions, while Fabric identities allow users to be identified in a blockchain context.\n\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, as well as the IBM Blockchain Platform, this component is the Certificate Authority (CA), which creates identities in the form of x509 certificates as well defining of an organization through the creation of a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines the permissions of identities at a component and channel level. These identities can include attributes about them, for example, by linking them to a particular organization or organizational unit (OU).\n\nAn organization MSP, for example, has an MSP subfolder called admins. Any user whose certificate is inside that admin folder is an admin of the organization. Because this MSP defines the organization, it is listed in the configuration on every channel of which the organization is a member. As a result, whenever an admin of the organization tries to perform an action, the signing certificate of the admin (which is attached to all of its interactions) is checked against the certificates listed in the MSP. Does the certificate match the one listed in the channel configuration? If it does, the other organizations will validate it and the action can be performed. If not, the request to execute the transaction is rejected.\n\nIBM Blockchain Platform CAs are based on the [Hyperledger Fabric CA](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/), though it is possible to use another CA if it uses a PKI based on x.509 certificates. Because non-Fabric CAs are not configured to create properly formatted MSPs, users who want to use this kind of CA must create the MSP for themselves.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-blockchain-component-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03782-0-720", "score": 32.073727543918, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Why do I get a section error when I try to provide credit card information? \n\nYou are unable to complete the registration of a new account or to update the credit card information on an existing account because the Credit Card information section can\u2019t be loaded.\n\n  What\u2019s happening \n\nThe following error appears in the Credit Card information section of the form:\n\n> This section can\u2019t be loaded.\n\n  Why it\u2019s happening \n\nA network issue might affect the loading of this section of the form.\n\n  How to fix it \n\nYou can troubleshoot potential network problems by using a private or incognito window, by trying without a VPN or with a different VPN, or by using a browser on a different computer or device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-section-error"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03713-7896-8949", "score": 30.994671073082777, "text": "\nSubmit your account upgrade information again.
