A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For more information, see [partitioned databases](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databasespartitioned-databases-database).\n\nThe [Grouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudantgrouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant) guide provides an example of how documents for an e-commerce application might be used within an IBM Cloudant database.\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases \n\nIBM Cloudant supports two types of databases:\n\n\n\n* Partitioned\n* Nonpartitioned\n\n\n\nA partitioned database offers significant query performance and cost advantages but requires you to specify a logical partitioning of your data. The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned. The default for partitioned is false, maintaining compatibility with an earlier version.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07046-11817-13746","score":29.8009619097,"text":"\nHowever, a different document ID was assigned to it and stored in the parent_document_id field.

If you have an application that relies on the previous behavior, you can specify a version number earlier than 2023-03-31, such as 2020-08-30, in your API calls.\n\n\n\nNotes about enhancing data:\n\n\n\n* You cannot apply prebuilt or user-trained Smart Document Understanding models to JSON files.\n* When you apply an enrichment to a field from the JSON file, the field data type is converted to an array. The field is converted to an array even if it contains a single value. For example, \"field1\": \"Discovery\" becomes \"field1\": [\"Discovery\"].\n* Only the first 50,000 characters of a custom field from a JSON file are enriched.\n* In project types where the Part of Speech (POS) enrichment is applied automatically, the enrichment is applied to the field that contains the bulk of the file content in the first JSON file that is added to the collection. This field is determined by the following rules:\n\n\n\n* If a field is named text, the POS enrichment is applied to it.\n* The field with the longest string value and highest number of distinct values is chosen.\n* If more than one field meets the previous condition, one of the fields is chosen at random.\n\n\n\n* If you want to apply an enrichment to a nested field, you must create a Content Mining project, and then apply the enrichment to the field.

It searches for passages that have an approximate length of 200 characters, then looks at chunks of content that are twice that length to find passages that contain full sentences. Sentence boundary detection works for all supported languages and uses language-specific logic.\n\nFor all project types except Conversational Search, you can change how the passages are displayed in the search results from the Customize display > Search results page. For example, you can configure the number of passages that are shown per document and the maximum character size per passage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-index-overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it.

This field is determined by the following rules:\n\n\n\n* If a field is named text, the POS enrichment is applied to it.\n* The field with the longest string value and highest number of distinct values is chosen.\n* If more than one field meets the previous condition, one of the fields is chosen at random.\n\n\n\n* If you want to apply an enrichment to a nested field, you must create a Content Mining project, and then apply the enrichment to the field.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it. To test whether your fixes address the issue, you can convert the original file to a PDF file to check for unexpected carriage returns in the text.\n\nAfter applying a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model to a PPT file, table boundaries are not recognized properly\n: During the conversion process, text that is extracted from the table is confused with text that is outside the table in some PPT pages.

Capacity metrics\n\n Metric Description \n\n Reads per second The rate when simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its _id, or querying against a partitioned database that uses a partition key. \n Writes per second The rate when data is written to the database. API calls dealing with document creation, update, or deletion count as \"writes\". \n Global Queries per second The rate when the database is queried by global indices, typically by accessing the _find endpoint, secondary MapReduce, or search indices. \n Storage The amount of disk space occupied by your JSON data, attachments, and secondary indices. \n\n\n\nAs an example, the Lite plan offers 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB of storage for free. This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance.

If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate. For more information, see the following websites:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant docs on [attachments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments)\n* Detaching IBM Cloudant attachments to [Object Storage](https:\/\/medium.com\/codait\/detaching-cloudant-attachments-to-object-storage-with-serverless-functions-99b8c3c77925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fewer databases are better than many \n\nIf you can, limit the number of databases per IBM Cloudant account to 500 or fewer. While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run.

The Standard plan also charges for the amount of storage you use. Capacity is measured with the following metrics:\n\n\n\nTable 2. Capacity metrics\n\n Metric Description \n\n Reads per second The rate when simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its _id, or querying against a partitioned database that uses a partition key. \n Writes per second The rate when data is written to the database. API calls dealing with document creation, update, or deletion count as \"writes\". \n Global Queries per second The rate when the database is queried by global indices, typically by accessing the _find endpoint, secondary MapReduce, or search indices. \n Storage The amount of disk space occupied by your JSON data, attachments, and secondary indices. \n\n\n\nAs an example, the Lite plan offers 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB of storage for free. This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance. The Standard plan's smallest capacity has 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 20 GB of storage for USD$76.65 per month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-migrating-to-ibm-cloudant-on-ibm-cloud"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00558-23465-25360","score":40.9156769883,"text":"\nIBM Cloudant JSON documents and requests have the following maximum size limits:\n\n\n\nTable 4.

The Standard plan also charges for the amount of storage you use. Capacity is measured with the following metrics:\n\n\n\nTable 2. Capacity metrics\n\n Metric Description \n\n Reads per second The rate when simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its _id, or querying against a partitioned database that uses a partition key. \n Writes per second The rate when data is written to the database. API calls dealing with document creation, update, or deletion count as \"writes\". \n Global Queries per second The rate when the database is queried by global indices, typically by accessing the _find endpoint, secondary MapReduce, or search indices. \n Storage The amount of disk space occupied by your JSON data, attachments, and secondary indices. \n\n\n\nAs an example, the Lite plan offers 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB of storage for free. This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance. The Standard plan's smallest capacity has 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 20 GB of storage for USD$76.65 per month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-migrating-to-ibm-cloudant-on-ibm-cloud"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-447531-449109","score":42.4679897866,"text":"\n[Upload](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-document-versioning-and-mvccupload-the-new-revision-mvcc) the new revision.\n4.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03166-4-2012","score":28.9054758009,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

The answer returns - this time powered by our index. You might not notice a speed improvement for a small database, but the benefit is definitely felt as your data size and query volume grows. Indexing helps your queries remain performant as your application scales.\n\nWhen you tell IBM Cloudant to create a secondary index, it starts a background task that looks at all the documents in turn and creates a new data structure on disk: the index. The index is a balanced tree which pairs the keys (the attribute or attributes that you need indexed) with the document _id they came from.\n\nThe index can be used to efficiently lookup known keys and ranges of keys without having to rescan the entire database.\n\nAnother trick that you can employ at index time is the partial filter. You can optionally supply a partial filter in your index definition. This IBM Cloudant Query selector is executed at index time to decide which documents' data makes it to the index and which are ignored.\n\nIn this example, a selector is employed that allows only dates that fall on a weekend to make it to the index.

A convenient way to add all partitions that exist on Object Storage, is to use the following RECOVER PARTITIONS clause.\n\nALTER TABLE customers RECOVER PARTITIONS\n\nThis clause overwrites the current partition definitions for the table with the structure that is detected from Object Storage data by using the location prefix that is specified for the table. You can also update partition definitions selectively with the ADD PARTITION and DROP PARTITION clauses of the ALTER TABLE statement, for example, to attach more data to a table that was uploaded recently.\n\nWhen you added all partitions, the partitioned table is set up to be queried. You get all the German customers, if you submit the following query:\n\nSELECT customerID FROM customers WHERE country = 'Germany'\n\nThe query execution reads the objects only under the cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/customers_partitioned.csv\/country=Germany\/ prefix because the partition definitions are used by the query optimizer to minimize the necessary data transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Limitations \n\n\n\n* With the Standard plan, you can create up to 100 tables with up to 20,000 partitions per table.\n* If you use the Lite plan, the catalog management features, such as CREATE TABLE, are not allowed.\n* The ADD PARTITION option of the ALTER TABLE statement may not correctly locate partitions if the value for a partition column contains special characters, such as the colon : that can appear as a timestamp separator.\n\nWhen the location is inferred from one or more partition values, some special characters in the values are URL escaped when you construct the Object Storage location. For example, the statement ALTER TABLE mytable ADD PARTITION ( startTime = '2020-01-01 12:00:00' ) constructs a partition with an Object Storage location ...\/startTime=2020-01-01 12%3A00%3A00\/.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00522-2652-4218","score":14.3757344513,"text":"\nOpen the service instance that you created in the prerequisite section.\n3.

Indexing helps your queries remain performant as your application scales.\n\nWhen you tell IBM Cloudant to create a secondary index, it starts a background task that looks at all the documents in turn and creates a new data structure on disk: the index. The index is a balanced tree which pairs the keys (the attribute or attributes that you need indexed) with the document _id they came from.\n\nThe index can be used to efficiently lookup known keys and ranges of keys without having to rescan the entire database.\n\nAnother trick that you can employ at index time is the partial filter. You can optionally supply a partial filter in your index definition. This IBM Cloudant Query selector is executed at index time to decide which documents' data makes it to the index and which are ignored.\n\nIn this example, a selector is employed that allows only dates that fall on a weekend to make it to the index.

To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors.

Normally, Data Engine always appends jobid=<jobid> to the provided target path to ensure a unique result location with each query execution. However, in the following sample query, this suffix is eliminated by adding JOBPREFIX NONE to the path in the INTO clause.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-running"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13480-7832-9910","score":14.3343056574,"text":"\nSELECT * FROM cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/customers.csv\nINTO cos:\/\/us-geo\/mybucket\/customers_partitioned.csv\nPARTITIONED BY (country)\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Attach table partitions \n\nAfter you defined a partitioned table, it is initially empty and you must attach the partitions to it explicitly. A convenient way to add all partitions that exist on Object Storage, is to use the following RECOVER PARTITIONS clause.\n\nALTER TABLE customers RECOVER PARTITIONS\n\nThis clause overwrites the current partition definitions for the table with the structure that is detected from Object Storage data by using the location prefix that is specified for the table. You can also update partition definitions selectively with the ADD PARTITION and DROP PARTITION clauses of the ALTER TABLE statement, for example, to attach more data to a table that was uploaded recently.\n\nWhen you added all partitions, the partitioned table is set up to be queried. You get all the German customers, if you submit the following query:\n\nSELECT customerID FROM customers WHERE country = 'Germany'\n\nThe query execution reads the objects only under the cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/customers_partitioned.csv\/country=Germany\/ prefix because the partition definitions are used by the query optimizer to minimize the necessary data transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Limitations \n\n\n\n* With the Standard plan, you can create up to 100 tables with up to 20,000 partitions per table.\n* If you use the Lite plan, the catalog management features, such as CREATE TABLE, are not allowed.\n* The ADD PARTITION option of the ALTER TABLE statement may not correctly locate partitions if the value for a partition column contains special characters, such as the colon : that can appear as a timestamp separator.\n\nWhen the location is inferred from one or more partition values, some special characters in the values are URL escaped when you construct the Object Storage location. For example, the statement ALTER TABLE mytable ADD PARTITION ( startTime = '2020-01-01 12:00:00' ) constructs a partition with an Object Storage location ...\/startTime=2020-01-01 12%3A00%3A00\/.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13480-7-2163","score":14.3195299505,"text":"\nGetting started with the catalog \n\nEach instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Data Engine includes a database catalog that you can use to register and manage table definitions for your data on IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage. Catalog syntax is compatible with Hive metastore syntax. See how to [work with the catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogusage) and refer to the [Catalog management](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterHiveCatalog) section of the SQL reference.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\nYou can explore, change, or discover structured data on [Cloud Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage\/getting-started.htmlgetting-started-console) with Data Engine by using SQL syntax. To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07237-1522-3387","score":14.3143206685,"text":"\nIf you have recently deleted a Lite instance and then receive a 400 - Only one free environment is allowed per resource group error message when creating a new environment in a new Lite instance, you need to finish deleting the original Lite instance.

For more information, see [Natural language query](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parametersnlq).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do you improve query results? \n\nThe relevance of natural language query results can be improved in IBM Watson Discovery with training. You can train your private collections using either the Discovery tooling, or the Discovery APIs.

You can also connect to several different data sources (including Box, Salesforce, SharePoint Online, SharePoint 2016, and IBM Cloud Object Storage), or do a web crawl. For details, see [Adding content](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-addcontent).\n\n\n\n\n\n What document types are supported for ingestion?","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-troubleshoot"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07115-5269-7471","score":14.3121684579,"text":"\nYour documents might not have a text field if you uploaded a CSV file that doesn't have a column named text, or uploaded a JSON file that doesn't have an object named text, or if you used the Smart Document Understanding tool to define fields with other names in which the bulk of the content of your documents now are stored.\n\nWhen you train a project from the API, results are taken from all of the root-level fields and they are all considered to have equal significance. Unlike Discovery Query Language queries, with natural language queries you cannot specify which fields from the document you care about or how much significance to give to each one. When you teach Discovery with examples, the service figures out for you how much weight to give to each field.\n\nDiscovery builds a model that assigns different weights to term, bigram, and skip-gram matches for each of the root-level fields and balances them against matches from all of the other document fields. With enough examples, Discovery can return better answers because it knows where the best answers are typically stored.\n\nRelevancy training cannot be used to give more weight to nested fields. Nested fields are grouped and assigned one overall score. No matter how much you train, Discovery never gives a nested field more weight than it gives to a root-level field. For more information about nested fields, see the [FAQ](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-faqsfaq-nested-fields).\n\n\n\n\n\n Training a project \n\nThe training data that is used to train the relevancy model includes these parts:\n\n\n\n* A natural language query that is representative of a query that your users might submit\n* Results of the query which are returned by the service\n* The rating that you apply to the result that indicates whether the result is relevant or not relevant\n\n\n\nTo apply relevancy training to a project, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

A convenient way to add all partitions that exist on Object Storage, is to use the following RECOVER PARTITIONS clause.\n\nALTER TABLE customers RECOVER PARTITIONS\n\nThis clause overwrites the current partition definitions for the table with the structure that is detected from Object Storage data by using the location prefix that is specified for the table. You can also update partition definitions selectively with the ADD PARTITION and DROP PARTITION clauses of the ALTER TABLE statement, for example, to attach more data to a table that was uploaded recently.\n\nWhen you added all partitions, the partitioned table is set up to be queried. You get all the German customers, if you submit the following query:\n\nSELECT customerID FROM customers WHERE country = 'Germany'\n\nThe query execution reads the objects only under the cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/customers_partitioned.csv\/country=Germany\/ prefix because the partition definitions are used by the query optimizer to minimize the necessary data transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Limitations \n\n\n\n* With the Standard plan, you can create up to 100 tables with up to 20,000 partitions per table.\n* If you use the Lite plan, the catalog management features, such as CREATE TABLE, are not allowed.\n* The ADD PARTITION option of the ALTER TABLE statement may not correctly locate partitions if the value for a partition column contains special characters, such as the colon : that can appear as a timestamp separator.\n\nWhen the location is inferred from one or more partition values, some special characters in the values are URL escaped when you construct the Object Storage location. For example, the statement ALTER TABLE mytable ADD PARTITION ( startTime = '2020-01-01 12:00:00' ) constructs a partition with an Object Storage location ...\/startTime=2020-01-01 12%3A00%3A00\/.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07115-5269-7471","score":14.9849784421,"text":"\nYour documents might not have a text field if you uploaded a CSV file that doesn't have a column named text, or uploaded a JSON file that doesn't have an object named text, or if you used the Smart Document Understanding tool to define fields with other names in which the bulk of the content of your documents now are stored.\n\nWhen you train a project from the API, results are taken from all of the root-level fields and they are all considered to have equal significance. Unlike Discovery Query Language queries, with natural language queries you cannot specify which fields from the document you care about or how much significance to give to each one. When you teach Discovery with examples, the service figures out for you how much weight to give to each field.\n\nDiscovery builds a model that assigns different weights to term, bigram, and skip-gram matches for each of the root-level fields and balances them against matches from all of the other document fields. With enough examples, Discovery can return better answers because it knows where the best answers are typically stored.\n\nRelevancy training cannot be used to give more weight to nested fields.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated.

To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions.

For example, the statement ALTER TABLE mytable ADD PARTITION ( startTime = '2020-01-01 12:00:00' ) constructs a partition with an Object Storage location ...\/startTime=2020-01-01 12%3A00%3A00\/.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Any additional controls that are needed within a tenancy must be provisioned separately by using a gateway, security groups, or host-based controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Benefits of moving to VRF \n\nMoving to VRF includes the following primary benefits:\n\n\n\n* Industry-proven and widely accepted multiple isolation separation technologies. Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network. During conversion, your shared tenancy is converted to use a customer VRF, most commonly with a new Direct Link subscription.\n\nFor specific information about how to initiate a VRF conversion for your account, refer to the conversion instructions for your IBM Cloud offering.

Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network.

Red Hat OpenShift mainly automates the rotation process, but requires manual approval of certificate signing requests (CSRs). Therefore, it is important that you understand the Red Hat OpenShift certificate rotation schedule to avoid expired certificates.\n\nThe initial certificates that are created during installation expire 24 hours after they are created. IBM's automation process, which installs Red Hat OpenShift, handles the approval of the CSRs for this initial rotation, which is done by running a script on the bastion for the first 30 hours. The script is named \/root\/approve-csr.sh and its log file is named \/root\/approve-csr.log.\n\nFor the script to run successfully, the initial kubeadmin credentials must be the same until the initial certificate rotation is complete. Do not change the kubeadmin credentials for the first 24 hours. If the credentials are changed, you must monitor and approve the CSRs for the initial certificate rotation. For more information, see [Approving the CSRs for your machines](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.7\/installing\/installing_vsphere\/installing-vsphere.htmlinstallation-approve-csrs_installing-vsphere).\n\nDo not restart any of the Red Hat OpenShift cluster virtual machines (VMs) or the bastion VM until the first certificate rotation is done.\n\nAfter the initial certificate rotation, certificates are renewed every 30 days. You must establish a process to approve the CSRs for every certificate rotation. According to Red Hat\u00ae, you can approve CSRs when they reach 80% of their expiration period, which is approximately 25 days into the lifespan of the CSRs.\n\nIf you do not approve CSRs in time and the certificates expire, you can recover from expired control plane certificates and get the Red Hat OpenShift cluster operational again.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-ocp_managing"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

During the setup process CIS detects the nameservers and activates the domain.\n\n\n\n*  If the nameservers no longer point to CIS, the system automatically mark your domain as Moved after 7 days. An email to inform you of this status change is sent to the email address on file. A domain in Moved status remains in the system for an additional 7 days before it is permanently deleted.\n*  Conflicting NS records can cause a domain to change to Moved status.\n\n\n\n  How to fix it \n\nTo resolve the condition where your domain remains in Moved status longer than expected, take the following troubleshooting steps.\n\n\n\n*  Check your DNS registrar and ensure that the NS records match with the NS records given by CIS.\n\n\n\n*  Find the NS records in the CIS name servers section of the DNS tab in the Reliability page.

Configure your name servers with the registrar or existing DNS provider](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-getting-startedconfigure-your-name-servers-with-the-registrar-or-existing-dns-provider).\n\n\n\n*  Run the activation check API again. You can use the [API endpoint](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/ciszone-activation-check) first to initiate the recheck.\n\n\n\n*  As long as the NS values for the domain are pointed in the correct direction by a dig, and the reactivation check is done by using the API, the domain should go from Moved status to Active.\n\n\n\n*  Remove and replace any previous NS records with the CIS-provided records in your DNS registrar.\n\n\n\nIf the domain is still stuck in a Moved status after taking these steps, [open a Support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-gettinghelp) case with details about which steps you took.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-764402-766313","score":22.6103674041,"text":"\nTo fix this issue, ask your host to allowlist all of the CIS IP ranges, listed [here](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-allowlisted-ip-addresses).\n\nAll of these IPs must be allowlisted to avoid 522 errors. It's also worth checking to see if any IPs in these ranges are blocked.\n\n522 errors can also be caused by network connectivity issues, so confirm that your server and network is generally healthy and not overloaded.\n\nIf after taking the above steps you still receive errors, contact IBM CIS support and confirm the following:\n\n\n\n* You've allowlisted our IP ranges\n* Your server\/network is online and generally healthy\n\n\n\nIf you contact our support team, please provide a Ray ID from a recent 522 error. We can use this to determine which CIS data center you were hitting and run further tests.\n* What is a proxied record and why do I need them?\n\nProxied records are records that proxy their traffic through IBM CIS. Only proxied records receive CIS benefits, such as IP masking, where a CIS IP is substituted for your origin IP to protect it:\n\n$ whois 104.28.22.57 | grep OrgName\nOrgName: IBM\n\nIf you would rather bypass CIS on a domain (we still resolve DNS), then non-proxying the record is a possible solution.\n* I got a DNS Validation error: 1004; now what can I do?\n\nFor page rules to work, DNS needs to resolve for your zone. As a result, you must have a proxied DNS record for your zone.\n* Can I add a CNAME for a root record?\n\nYes. IBM CIS supports a feature called \"CNAME Flattening\" which allows our users to add a CNAME as a root record. Our authoritative DNS servers enumerate the CNAME target's records and respond with those records instead of the CNAME itself, effectively hiding the fact that the user configured a CNAME at the root of the domain.\n* What is the default health check timeout?\n\nThe default health check timeout for the Free Trial and Standard plans is 60 seconds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04334-25771-26954","score":22.5731380631,"text":"\nCreate a dns record in domain 31984fea73a15b45779fa0df4ef62f9b.\n\nibmcloud cis dns-record-create 31984fea73a15b45779fa0df4ef62f9b --json '{\"name\": \"testCNAME\", \"type\": \"CNAME\", \"content\": \"example.com\"}' -i \"cis-demo\"\nibmcloud cis dns-record-create 31984fea73a15b45779fa0df4ef62f9b --type A --name testA --content \"127.0.0.1\" -i \"cis-demo\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ibmcloud cis dns-record-update \n\nUpdate a DNS record for a given domain of a service instance.\n\nibmcloud cis dns-record-update DNS_DOMAIN_ID DNS_RECORD_ID (--json @JSON_FILE | JSON_STRING) [-i, --instance INSTANCE] [--output FORMAT]\nibmcloud cis dns-record-update DNS_DOMAIN_ID DNS_RECORD_ID [--type TYPE] [--name NAME] [--content CONTENT] [--proxied PROXIED] [--ttl TTL] [--output FORMAT]\n[Deprecated] ibmcloud cis dns-record-update DNS_DOMAIN_ID DNS_RECORD_ID --json-str JSON_STR [-i, --instance INSTANCE] [--output FORMAT]\n[Deprecated] ibmcloud cis dns-record-update DNS_DOMAIN_ID DNS_RECORD_ID --json-file JSON_FILE [-i, --instance INSTANCE] [--output FORMAT]\n\n\n\n Command options \n\nDNS_DOMAIN_ID\n: The ID of DNS domain.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

When lifecycle management is important with environments being regularly stood up and torn down, using Terraform with Schematics Workspaces is recommended. Terraform keeps a record of the current state of your deployed cloud infrastructure and Schematics is able to remove your infrastructure in reverse dependency order without manual intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n Idempotence \n\nA benefit of the declarative approached used by Terraform and Ansible is idempotence. Idempotent tasks can be executed multiple times with the same end result. Irrespective of the previous state or starting place when restarting after failures, the provisioned infrastructure and configuration are always the same. This aspect is key to ensuring consistency and repeatability of environments deployed using Schematics.\n\nHow you use a tool and the modules used both have an impact on idempotency. Generally, Terraform and Ansible modules are written to be idempotent. With both tools, code can we written that does not yield an idempotent result. In which case, the configuration may drift from the desired target state. With Terraform this form of drift is most likely when null-resources are used to extend provider functionality with custom scripts which are not idempotent.\n\nImmutability is an IaC practice that minimizes the risk of drift from the target state.\n\n\n\n\n\n Immutablity \n\nImmutable infrastructure refers to managing services and software deployments where resources like containers or virtual machines are replaced rather than changed (using scripts). The main desire here for immutability is avoiding configuration drift. Inconsistencies that arise due to local or manual changes, or differences in the sequence of automated operations. Changes that make it harder to debug and resolve issues, and increase support costs.\n\nTo ensure immutability and eliminate drift, all changes should be made through the Schematics IaC configuration, and resources like VSIs should be redeployed when they need updating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\nNow you understand more about IaC, why not review the use of IaC in Schematics:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-infrastructure-as-code"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00959-2830-5215","score":14.1812077285,"text":"\n* Avoid application downtime.\n* Enable production testing of new functions without impacting customers.\n* Limit the impact of production issues to a subset of users.\n* Enable rapid rollback to the previous version if issues are found.\n\n\n\nMany possible deployment strategies are available. In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10852-44214-45420","score":13.5202575416,"text":"\n* [Install mobile SDK with Carthage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkinstall-mobile-sdk-carthage)\n* [Install mobile SDK from source code](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkinstall-mobile-sdk-source-code)\n\n\n\n* [Install the starter app example for mobile SDK](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkinstall-mobile-sdk-starter-app)\n* [Getting started with mobile SDK](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkget-started-mobile-sdk)\n* [Invoke a mobile SDK action](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkinvoke-mobile-sdk-action)\n* [Fire a mobile SDK trigger](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkfire-mobile-sdk-trigger)\n* [Use mobile SDK actions that return a result](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkmobile-sdk-actions-results)\n* [Configuring the mobile SDK](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkconfigure-mobile-sdk)\n\n\n\n* [Support for qualified names with mobile SDK](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkqualified-names-mobile-sdk)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-sitemap"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.3333333333,"recall_10":0.3333333333,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_10":0.469278726}}

The first is the old style of home smoke detector that didn\u2019t have a feature to indicate low battery. Without that feature, the homeowner did not have a way of knowing if the detector would work in the case of a fire. This omission could be worked around, and people would replace the battery once a year whether it needed it or not. The second example is the old style Christmas tree lights with incandescent colored light bulbs with all the lights connected in series (what were known as \u201csingle strand\u201d Christmas lights). Since the bulbs were connected in series, if any bulb burned out the entire string would not light up. The fix was to try replacing each light one at a time to see if the string would light up.

Unfortunately such methods do not scale well, but they do exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Redundancy options in IBM Cloud \n\nWhile the preceding discussion of the various aspects of achieving high availability in a cloud environment provides a useful framework for thinking about availability generally, it doesn\u2019t answer one of the key questions for teams looking to create an application to run on the cloud, or even those just looking to run an existing cloud-enabled application on a vendor provided public cloud. That question is what design options are actually available.\n\nWhile there are numerous technically feasible approaches to redundancy, IBM public cloud has simplified the possible alternatives to a set of four choices, where each choice has both geographic and technical aspects packaged together.\n\nNo redundancy\n: IBM allows a customer to lease just enough compute, storage, and network facilities to run a single instance of their system. This is the lowest cost option, available at data centers around the world, and comes with an availability target of 99.9% uptime, not including planned outages.\n\nLocal redundancy\n: This next level up provides two instances of the system in a single data center. Target uptime for local redundancy is 99.95% uptime, not including planned outages.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.6666666667,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.765360637,"ndcg_cut_5":0.765360637,"ndcg_cut_10":0.932521092}}

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. Add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it.

It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You can restore data from a backup by using the UI, the CLI, or the API. You can restore boot and data volumes during instance creation, when you modify an existing instance, or when you provision a stand-alone volume. When you restore data from a backup snapshot, the data is pulled from an Object Storage bucket. For best performance, you can enable backup snapshots for fast restore. By using the fast restore feature, you can restore a volume that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. When you use fast restore, the data is pulled from a cached backup snapshot in another zone of your VPC. For more information, see [About restoring from a backup snapshot](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore).\n\n\n\n\n\n Am I charged for usage? \n\nYes.

The boot volume uses a general-purpose profile and is limited to 250 GB.\n* A new data volume that was created from nonbootable snapshot inherits its properties from the original volume, such as [profile](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), capacity, data, and metadata. If the source volume used [customer-managed encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-customer-managed-encryption), the volume inherits that encryption with the original customer root key (CRK).

You can use the \/dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the \/dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03270-3352-5135","score":18.3448834351,"text":"\nAdd a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step.

Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request. Instead of asking the customer to retry or rephrase the question over and over, your assistant can offer to transfer the customer to a human agent.\n\n\n\nTo design a dialog that can transfer the conversation, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2. Add a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step. Choose Connect to human agent as the response type.\n\nFor more information, see [Adding a Connect to human agent response type](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-add-connect-to-human-agent).\n3.

After defining the intent, you can add a root-level dialog node that conditions on the intent. As the dialog node response, add a Connect to human agent response type. At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person. Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request. Instead of asking the customer to retry or rephrase the question over and over, your assistant can offer to transfer the customer to a human agent.\n\n\n\nTo design a dialog that can transfer the conversation, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2. Add a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step. Choose Connect to human agent as the response type.\n\nFor more information, see [Adding a Connect to human agent response type](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-add-connect-to-human-agent).\n3. Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it. To ensure that a useful summary is provided to service desk agents when a conversation is transferred to them, add short dialog node names that reflect the node's purpose. For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02844-1555-3643","score":28.3849344413,"text":"\nconversation.counterexample.update edits a counterexample. \n conversation.data.update does a bulk action, such as importing a CSV file of intents or entities to the skill, or deleting multiple training data items, such as multiple entities or intents. \n conversation.entity.create creates an entity. \n conversation.entity.delete deletes an entity. \n conversation.entity.update edits an entity. \n conversation.example.create adds a user input example to an intent. \n conversation.example.delete deletes a user example from an intent. \n conversation.example.update edits a user example that is associated with an intent. \n conversation.intent.create creates an intent. \n conversation.intent.delete deletes an intent. \n conversation.intent.update edits an intent. \n conversation.log.create corrects an intent that was inaccurately categorized by the skill from the Analytics>User conversations page. \n conversation.node.create creates a dialog node. \n conversation.node.delete deletes a dialog node. \n conversation.node.update edits a dialog node. \n conversation.skill.create creates a skill, either dialog or search. \n conversation.skill.delete deletes a skill. \n conversation.skill.update updates a skill. \n conversation.skill_reference.create adds a specific skill to an assistant. \n conversation.skill_reference.delete removes a specific skill from an assistant. \n conversation.skill_reference.update updates a specific skill that is associated with an assistant. \n conversation.snapshot.create creates a version of a dialog skill. \n conversation.snapshot.delete deletes a version of a dialog skill. \n conversation.synonym.create creates a synonym for an entity value. \n conversation.synonym.delete deletes a synonym that is associated with an entity value. \n conversation.synonym.update edits a synonym that is associated with an entity value. \n conversation.userdata.delete deletes data that was created by a specified customer. \n conversation.value.create creates an entity value. \n conversation.value.delete deletes an entity value. \n conversation.value.update edits an entity value.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-audit-events"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03054-25568-27566","score":28.2949279162,"text":"\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer {token}\" -H \"Content-Type:application\/json\" -X POST -d \"{\"input\": {\"text\": \"Hello\"}}\" \"https:\/\/{my-cluster-hostname}\/assistant\/api\/v2\/assistants\/{assistant_id}\/sessions\/{session_id}\/message?version=2019-02-28\"\n\n\n\n* {token} is the token that is generated in Step 3.\n* {assistant_id} is the assistant ID you copied in Step 2.\n* {session_id} is the ID of the session that you created in the previous step.\n\n\n\n8.

You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. The name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own.

You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

After your assistant is live, the built-in metrics of active user conversations help you understand what your customers are asking about, how well your assistant is able to meet their needs, and what to focus on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n 3. Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

For example, you might want app pods to deploy to only worker nodes in a certain worker pool because those worker nodes are on bare metal machines. To designate the worker nodes that app pods must deploy to, add an affinity rule to your app deployment.\n\nBefore you begin\n\n\n\n* [Access your Red Hat OpenShift cluster](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-access_cluster).\n* Make sure that you are assigned a [service access role](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-userschecking-perms) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources in the Red Hat OpenShift project.\n* Optional: [Set a label for the worker pool](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-add_workersworker_pool_labels) that you want to run the app on.\n\n\n\nTo deploy apps to specific worker nodes,\n\n\n\n1.

However, VMs have a performance tradeoff when compared to bare metal specs, such as networking Gbps, RAM and memory thresholds, and storage options. Keep in mind these factors that impact your VM costs.\n\n\n\n* Shared versus dedicated: If you share the underlying hardware of the VM, the cost is less than dedicated hardware, but the physical resources are not dedicated to your VM.\n* Hourly billing only: Hourly billing offers more flexibility to order and cancel VMs quickly. You are charged an hourly rate that is metered for only the time that that the worker node is provisioned. The time is not rounded up or down to the nearest hour, but is metered in minutes and charged at the hourly rate. For example, if your worker node is provisioned for 90 minutes, you are charged the hourly rate for 1.5 hours, not 2 hours.\n* Tiered hours per month: The [pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/kubernetes\/catalog\/aboutpricing) is billed hourly in [graduated tiered](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-chargesgraduated_tier). As your VM remains ordered for a tier of hours within a billing month, the hourly rate that you are charged lowers.

The Standard plan is priced based on two factors: the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated, and the amount of data that is stored in the instance.\n\nPricing is pro-rated hourly with a starting provisioned throughput capacity of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. This rate is equal to a starting cost of USD $0.105 per hour. You can toggle the provisioned throughput capacity up or down by using the user interface or API. Toggle in increments of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage. If you store more than 20 GB, you're charged a defined cost per GB per hour.\n\nRefer to the IBM Cloud Pricing Calculator in the dashboard for pricing at different capacities and currencies, and the [pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricingpricing) information for examples to estimate costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dedicated Hardware plan","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.3868528072,"ndcg_cut_5":0.3868528072,"ndcg_cut_10":0.5802792109}}

If you already have one Lite plan instance, you can't create a second Lite plan instance, or change a Standard plan instance to a Lite plan. If you try, you see the following message. You can have only one instance of a Lite plan per service. To create a new instance, either delete your existing Lite plan instance or select a paid plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Standard plan \n\nThe IBM Cloudant Standard plan is available to all paid IBM Cloud\u00ae accounts, either as pay-as-you-go or subscription, and scales to meet the needs of your application. The Standard plan is priced based on two factors: the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated, and the amount of data that is stored in the instance.\n\nPricing is pro-rated hourly with a starting provisioned throughput capacity of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. This rate is equal to a starting cost of USD $0.105 per hour. You can toggle the provisioned throughput capacity up or down by using the user interface or API. Toggle in increments of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage. If you store more than 20 GB, you're charged a defined cost per GB per hour.\n\nRefer to the IBM Cloud Pricing Calculator in the dashboard for pricing at different capacities and currencies, and the [pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricingpricing) information for examples to estimate costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dedicated Hardware plan","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs.

This index size is good, since index size contributes to storage costs.\n* The index is robust.

Following are the three key concepts in RAID:\n\n\n\n* Mirroring: copying data to more than one disk\n* Striping: splitting data across more than one disk\n* Error correction (fault tolerance): redundant data is stored to allow problems to be detected and possibly fixed.\n\n\n\nAlthough many different levels of RAID exist, IBM chooses to support the most common RAID types: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity \/ Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read\/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05138-7979-9034","score":21.2538512409,"text":"\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

When an employee joins the company, the records that are associated with that employee can be indefinitely retained.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":27.5699817071,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04111-35313-36062","score":27.2141552359,"text":"\nGet Bot Management settings.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04111-35313-36062","score":27.2141552359,"text":"\nGet Bot Management settings.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04111-35313-36062","score":22.1730951537,"text":"\nGet Bot Management settings.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16286-1338-3308","score":20.887534659,"text":"\nClick Next to begin app registration.\n\n\n\n\n\n App registration \n\n\n\n1.

When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image.

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds.

The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request.

Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07067-26099-28206","score":13.3059144968,"text":"\nIf false, ranks the passages from all of the documents by passage quality regardless of the document quality and returns them in a separate passages field in the response.\n* When passages are returned for a query, you can also enable answer finding.

Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds.

The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request. The service calculates and returns metrics in real-time at the requested interval.\n* With the asynchronous HTTP interface, you specify query parameters with a speech recognition request. The service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events. If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number.

The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on.

The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1232569-1234428","score":17.4886233464,"text":"\nIf the LUN is being presented to the hypervisor to serve VHD files, choose Hyper-V for its OS type.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Is the allocated IOPS limit enforced by instance or by volume?\n\nIOPS is enforced at the volume level.

This s3-multer object contains an s3 property that is assigned to our s3 object. There is also a bucket property that is assigned to the myBucket variable, which in turn is assigned a value of web-images. The s3-multer object now has all the data necessary to upload files to our Object Storage bucket when it receives data from the upload form. The name (or key) of the uploaded object is the original file name.\n\nUse a time stamp as part of the file name to maintain file name uniqueness.\n\nvar galleryController = function(title) {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-web-application"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16273-9159-11114","score":15.5630939293,"text":"\nIf you define step conditions that check the Ran successfully variable, you can create steps that enable your assistant to respond differently depending on whether the call to the extension succeeded.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07844-3757-5369","score":13.3970656526,"text":"\nRA-5 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (c) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes acceptance tests to validate every deployment<br><br><br>","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07844-2925-4586","score":13.3067207231,"text":"\nRA-5 (a) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br>","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1213887-1215935","score":13.2639969882,"text":"\nAfter you delete your Key Protect instance, Key Protect uses[envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption) to crypto-shred any data that is associated with the Key Protect instance.\n* Why does the user interface show unauthorized access?\n\nSetting and retrieving the network access policy is only supported through the application programming interface (API).

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07844-4589-6711","score":22.3272368387,"text":"\nRA-5 (c) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes acceptance tests to validate every deployment<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (d) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes acceptance tests to validate every deployment<br><br><br> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NIST supplemental guidance \n\nSecurity categorization of information systems guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans.

This approach resolves secrets sprawl and proliferation, and means that you can update secrets without updating your toolchain. When you use secret references, the actual secret value is resolved when the toolchain runs by dynamically retrieving it from Key Protect. This approach is useful when you must rotate the value of your toolchain secrets periodically.\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding a Key Protect tool integration to your toolchain template \n\nYou can add a Key Protect tool integration to your toolchain template by adding a service definition to the toolchain.yml file in your template repo. This file is the design blueprint for your toolchain and includes all of the tool integrations that are available when you create a toolchain instance based on that template.

For example, if you click New to mint a new API key, you can select the Save this key in a secrets store for reuse checkbox to save the API key in a Key Protect instance to use it again later. If you do not already have a Key Protect instance, a new instance is created for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n Authorizing your toolchain to access secrets \n\nReferences to secrets that are stored in Key Protect are dynamically resolved when the toolchain runs.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03166-23681-24372","score":21.8355069181,"text":"\nFor Lite plans, usage is measured by the number of \/message calls (API) are sent to the assistant from the web chat integration.

Additionally, you can enforce rate limits through Plans or through operations within a Plan's APIs that override the Plan's rate limit.\n\nPlans can also specify billing costs for customers who use your Products. For example, you can define three different Plans for a single Product. Each Plan can have a different subscription cost and a different rate limit that targets different customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Products \n\nPlans and APIs are grouped in Products.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost.

This design enables native connectivity to VPC and future capabilities without being forced into the classic IaaS network.\n\nDirect Link allows connectivity to both classic IaaS as well as VPCs, whereas IBM Cloud Direct Link on Classic always connects to the IaaS network and a global VRF first. IBM Cloud Direct Link on Classic can only reach the VPC on a limited basis using a feature named Classic Access and by adding global routing to the direct link.

Just by using a managed service like Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae, you are saving many expenses that are associated with managing, updating, and maintaining an infrastructure environment.\n\n\n\n Understanding costs by component \n\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters, you can use IBM Cloud infrastructure compute, networking, and storage resources with platform services such as Watson AI or Compose Database-as-a-Service. Each resource might entail its own charges that can be [fixed, metered, tiered, or reserved](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-chargescharges) and billed by various incremental rates such as monthly or hourly.\n\nMonthly resources are billed based on the first of the month for usage in the preceding month.

However, if you cancel a resource in the middle of the month, you are still charged the full amount for the monthly resource.\n\n\n\n Worker nodes \n\nClusters can have two main types of worker nodes: virtual or physical (bare metal) machines.

You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place. This unified view of your credit spending means you can right-size your subscriptions across all of your usage to make sure you're getting the best deal. And there's no juggling multiple invoices - your enterprise billing administrator gets a single invoice with the details of any charges. It's that simple.\n\nIf you want to dive into the details to see where your money is going, you can do that.

Account groups can't contain resources themselves, but you can view costs for resource usage from the accounts that they contain.\n* Accounts, which are just like stand-alone IBM Cloud accounts in that they contain resources and resource groups, Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces, and independent access permissions. However, one major difference is that each account in an enterprise doesn't manage its own billing or payments because these are handled at the enterprise account level.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Comparative analysis of account types\n\n Pay-As-You-Go Subscription Enterprise Savings Plan \n\n Monthly billing Timely billing Timely billing \n Invoiced on monthly consumption Invoices independent of usage Invoiced on monthly consumption \n Best suited for developers and companies Best suited for enterprise organizations Best suited for both developers and enterprise organizations \n\n\n\n\n\n Estimating your costs \n\nAfter you select the type of account that fits your organization's needs, it's time to understand how you will be charged for it. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-5228-7163","score":32.9768328193,"text":"\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.\n* Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing your payments \n\nIf you're a new Pay-As-You-Go account owner that is located in the US and you are paying with a credit card, you can replace your current card with a new one or edit the details of an existing card. In either case, you manage your credit card from the [Payments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/payments) page in the IBM Cloud console.\n\nIf you own one of the following accounts, in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, you can go to Manage > Billing and usage to make a one-time payment, change your credit card details, view your billing items, and manage your invoices.\n\n\n\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts based in the US with any payment method other than a credit card\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts not based in the US\n* New and existing Subscription accounts worldwide\n\n\n\nThe process for updating a credit card requires a manual review that might take a few days to process. To view your open change request cases, go to [IBM Cloud Support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/unifiedsupport\/supportcenter).\n\nYou might manage your payment method on a separate billing platform.

To buy new subscriptions or change future subscription amounts, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud?contactmodule).\n\n\n\n\n\n Support subscriptions \n\nTo view support subscription usage, in the console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Support costs.

For more information, see [Viewing your support costs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Subscription credit \n\nAfter you buy a subscription for platform or support credit, you add the credit to your account by applying a subscription code. Applying the code ensures that the credit is added to your account and you don't have unexpected overage charges.\n\nFor more information, see [Applying subscription codes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscription_code).\n\n\n\n\n\n Expiring subscriptions \n\nYou are notified by email 60, 30, 14, and 1 day before the expiration date of the last subscription on the account. After the subscription expires, your account is converted to a Pay-As-You Go account, which means you pay only for billable services that you use with no contracts or commitments. The discounts that are associated with the subscription account won't apply to the Pay-As-You-Go account. The IBM Sales team is happy to help extend your subscription before you reach its expiration date. If you extend your subscription within 30 days from the expiration date, you won't get charged at the Pay-As-You-Go account rate. After 30 days, you are invoiced as a Pay-As-You-Go account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03704-10459-12479","score":31.8592794394,"text":"\n* Compare the date of your invoice to the start and end dates of the promo code.

Beyond this starting price, any additional costs for support are based on your resource usage. The higher your resource usage, the higher your total support cost. For details about your purchased support plan, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud?contactmodule).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Viewing support costs \n\nTo view your support costs, you need an access policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service. For more information about access roles, see [IAM access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-userroles).\n\nIn the IBM Cloud console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Support costs. You can view your support plan and relevant cost details:\n\n\n\n*  If your support costs are billed monthly, you can view your costs for the current month. These costs include the starting price for the plan and any additional costs from your resource usage. After each billing cycle, these charges are added to your monthly invoice.\n*  If you have a support subscription, you can view the remaining credit in your active subscriptions and any overages for the current month. Overage is charged if you run out of credit in your active subscriptions. You can also view upcoming support subscriptions, which are subscriptions that you bought but are not yet valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/get-support?topic=get-support-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-5228-7163","score":38.2827095179,"text":"\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.\n* Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing your payments \n\nIf you're a new Pay-As-You-Go account owner that is located in the US and you are paying with a credit card, you can replace your current card with a new one or edit the details of an existing card. In either case, you manage your credit card from the [Payments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/payments) page in the IBM Cloud console.\n\nIf you own one of the following accounts, in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, you can go to Manage > Billing and usage to make a one-time payment, change your credit card details, view your billing items, and manage your invoices.\n\n\n\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts based in the US with any payment method other than a credit card\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts not based in the US\n* New and existing Subscription accounts worldwide\n\n\n\nThe process for updating a credit card requires a manual review that might take a few days to process.

You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place. This unified view of your credit spending means you can right-size your subscriptions across all of your usage to make sure you're getting the best deal. And there's no juggling multiple invoices - your enterprise billing administrator gets a single invoice with the details of any charges. It's that simple.\n\nIf you want to dive into the details to see where your money is going, you can do that. Enterprises provide top-down usage reporting so you can analyze costs for usage in your accounts and account groups. You have visibility from the enterprise level down to the resource type in each account.\n\nWhether you prefer to manage your cloud through the IBM Cloud console, the CLI, or our robust APIs, we have the capability to fit your work style. Learn more and start creating your enterprise at [https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/enterprise](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/enterprise).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enterprise hierarchy \n\nAt its core, an enterprise consists of three main building blocks:\n\n\n\n* The enterprise account, which serves as the parent account to all other accounts in the enterprise. The enterprise account manages billing for the entire enterprise, with usage costs from all accounts that are rolled up and paid from the enterprise account.\n* Account groups, which you can use to organize related accounts. Account groups can't contain resources themselves, but you can view costs for resource usage from the accounts that they contain.\n* Accounts, which are just like stand-alone IBM Cloud accounts in that they contain resources and resource groups, Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces, and independent access permissions. However, one major difference is that each account in an enterprise doesn't manage its own billing or payments because these are handled at the enterprise account level.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03787-5002-7004","score":36.510218321,"text":"\nA subscription is inactive if its term expires or all of its credit is spent.\n\n\n\nYou can use the spending and usage information on the Subscriptions page to evaluate whether your subscriptions suit your usage needs.

To buy new subscriptions or change future subscription amounts, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud?contactmodule).\n\n\n\n\n\n Support subscriptions \n\nTo view support subscription usage, in the console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Support costs.

Applying the code ensures that the credit is added to your account and you don't have unexpected overage charges.\n\nFor more information, see [Applying subscription codes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscription_code).\n\n\n\n\n\n Expiring subscriptions \n\nYou are notified by email 60, 30, 14, and 1 day before the expiration date of the last subscription on the account. After the subscription expires, your account is converted to a Pay-As-You Go account, which means you pay only for billable services that you use with no contracts or commitments. The discounts that are associated with the subscription account won't apply to the Pay-As-You-Go account. The IBM Sales team is happy to help extend your subscription before you reach its expiration date. If you extend your subscription within 30 days from the expiration date, you won't get charged at the Pay-As-You-Go account rate. After 30 days, you are invoiced as a Pay-As-You-Go account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.3868528072,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3868528072}}
