A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00639-1531-2607","score":25.7791464655,"text":"\nFor more information about creating complex selector expressions, see [Creating selector expressions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-selector-syntaxcreating-selector-expressions).\n\n\n\n\n\n Selector with two fields \n\nIn the following example, the selector matches any document with a name field that contains Paul, and that also has a location field with the value \"Boston\".\n\nSee the following example of a more complex selector:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"name\": \"Paul\",\n\"location\": \"Boston\"\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Subfields \n\nUse a more complex selector to specify the values for a field of nested objects, or subfields.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it.

JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small.

Its job is to store your application's data securely and make it possible for you to retrieve it quickly and efficiently. IBM Cloudant's key features are shown in the following list:\n\nDatabase\n: Stores and retrieves data. More specifically, it is a JSON document store. JSON comes from JavaScript and represents simple objects in a universal file format.\n\nDocument\n: The unit of storage in IBM Cloudant. Documents are added, updated, and deleted in their entirety.\n\nHTTP API\n: Any IBM Cloudant operation can be achieved by using HTTPS. HTTP is the protocol that powers the World Wide Web and IBM Cloudant is a database that is built for the web. Most databases are hidden in a private network, inaccessible but to a handful of machines. The IBM Cloudant service sits (mainly) on the public internet where it can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection (and permission to do so).\n\nIBM Cloudant wasn't written entirely by IBM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00550-5969-7901","score":23.2129418792,"text":"\n}\nShow more\n\nAlternatively, you could produce totals that are grouped by order_id.\n\n\n\n\n\n Example of totals grouped by order_id, with ?group_level=1 \n\n{\n\"rows\":[\n{\n\"key\":\"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"value\":0\n}\n]\n}\n\nSince the view in the previous example returns 0 for the order value, the result indicates that the order is fully paid. The reason is that the positive purchase order total cancels the negative payment amounts. Recording events as separate documents, for example, one for the order and one for each payment, is good practice in IBM Cloudant. This practice avoids the possibility of creating conflicts when multiple processes modify the same document simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding more documents \n\nYou might add other, separate documents to the database to record the following state changes as the order is provisioned and dispatched:\n\n\n\n* Dispatch notifications\n* Delivery receipts\n* Refund records\n\n\n\nAs the data arrives, IBM Cloudant writes to each document separately. Therefore, it's not necessary to modify the core purchase document.\n\n\n\n\n\n Advantages of storing purchase orders in IBM Cloudant \n\nUsing IBM Cloudant to store purchase order information allows an ordering system to be highly available and scalable. With an ordering system like this one, you can deal with large volumes of data and high rates of concurrent access. By modeling the data in separate documents that are only written once, you can ensure that documents never become conflicted, such as during concurrent access to the same document by separate processes.\n\nFurthermore, documents can contain copies of data that exists in other collections to represent - rather than rely on - joining data with a foreign key. For example, IBM Cloudant records the state of a basket at the time of purchase. This record allows an order's state to be fetched by a single call to an IBM Cloudant view that groups documents related by order_id.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00636-1682-3261","score":23.2123173036,"text":"\nFor more information, see the [IAM guide](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudant) or the legacy [Authentication document](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-accountauthentication). \n Authorization IBM Cloudant supports both legacy and IAM access controls.

Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

These customization points include the following:\n\n\n\n* Customizing actions: By writing expressions and editing JSON data, you can extensively customize how an action evaluates step conditions, how it stores data, how it responds to customer input, and how it interacts with channels.

This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

Customers can click a suggested topic to submit it as input or click the X icon to close the suggestions list.\n\nStarting with web chat version 3.1, if customers select a suggestion and the response is not helpful, they can open the suggestions list again to try a different suggestion. The input generated by the first choice is submitted and recorded as part of the conversation. However, any contextual information that is generated by the initial suggestion is reset when the subsequent suggestion is submitted.\n\nThe suggestions are shown automatically in situations where the customer might otherwise become frustrated. For example, if a customer uses different wording to ask the same question multiple times in succession, and the same dialog node is triggered each time, then related topic suggestions are shown in addition to the triggered node's response. The suggestions that are offered give the customer a quick way to get the conversation back on track.\n\nThe suggestions list is populated with dialog nodes that condition on intents that are related in some way to the matched intent. The intents are ones that the AI model considered to be possible alternatives, but that didn't meet the high confidence threshold that is required for a node to be listed as a disambiguation option. Any dialog node with a node name (or external node name) can be shown as a suggestion, unless its Show node name setting is set to Off.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03313-6149-8039","score":26.5960679225,"text":"\n[Learn more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities). \n Try it out A chat window that you use to test as you build.

If the user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to still access their anonymous attributes by attaching their anonymous profile to their user identity with App ID.\n\n\n\n Understanding progressive authentication \n\nWhen a user chooses not to sign in immediately, they are considered an anonymous user. For example, say you're an online retailer and you want to allow users to add objects to their shopping cart without signing in. However, you ask them to sign in to complete their purchase. If a user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to access the same objects that were in their shopping carts before they signed in.\n\nYou can use App ID to gather information about anonymous users into an anonymous user profile, which you can use to help personalize their experience of your application. If the user chooses to signs in, you can attach the user attributes that are part of the anonymous profile to their user identity that is stored in App ID. Anonymous profiles are temporarily valid. While you develop your app, you can [configure the lifetime](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-managing-idpidp-token-lifetime) of anonymous tokens.\n\nWhen a user signs in, they become an identified user. If an existing identified user profile does not exist, you can create a new identified user profile.

However, an identified user can still access the attributes of their anonymous profile because they are accessible with the new access and identity tokens.\n\nYou can attach the attributes of only one anonymous profile to the user's identity that is stored in App ID. For example, say that a user browses your application anonymously in two separate browser tabs. The user adds a t-shirt to the shopping cart on the first tab and a pair of shorts to the cart on the second tab.

With IBM Cloud\u00ae App ID, you can configure one or several identity providers to create a custom sign-in experience for your users.\n\nApp ID interacts with identity providers by using various protocols such as OpenID Connect, SAML, and more. For example, OpenID Connect is the protocol that is used with many social providers such as Facebook, Google. Enterprise providers such as [Azure Active Directory](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-azure-active-directory) or [Active Directory Federation Service](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-active-directory-federation-service), generally use SAML as their identity protocol. For [Cloud Directory](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), the service uses SCIM to verify identity information.\n\nWhen you use social or enterprise identity providers, App ID reads user account information. Because the service never has write access to the information, users must go through their chosen identity provider to do actions, such as resetting their password. For example, if a user signs in to your app with Facebook, and then wanted to change their password, they must go to www.facebook.com to do so.\n\nWhen you use [Cloud Directory](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), App ID is the identity provider. The service uses your registry to verify your users identity. Because App ID is the identity provider, users can take advantage of advanced functionality, such as resetting their password, directly in your app.\n\nWorking with application identity?

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16368-6482-8187","score":23.8123314083,"text":"\n[development icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718\/watson-assistant\/images\/development-icon.png)Example: For a working example that shows how to add custom elements to the home screen, see [Home screen custom elements for Watson Assistant web chat](https:\/\/github.com\/watson-developer-cloud\/assistant-toolkit\/tree\/master\/integrations\/webchat\/examples\/home-screen-custom-element).\n* To change the home screen style, use [CSS helper classes](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-renderhelper_classes).\n\n\n\nCustomizing strings\n: You can customize the strings that define the various labels and hardcoded phrases displayed by the web chat.

The same duplication will not occur when importing ordering nodes.\n* The Identities box is left deselected in the export panel by default for reasons we discussed earlier: these identities contain private keys, therefore it is inadvisable to export them unless it is necessary to do so. Also, unlike MSPs and nodes, the console does not permit duplicate identities. If you attempt to import a bulk data ZIP that includes an identity that already exists in your console, the import will fail. Note once again that all identities will be sent in the bulk transfer, regardless of the other boxes you check. For example, if you only leave the peer box selected, and select identities, every identity in your Wallet will be sent, not just the identities relevant to the peer.\n* However, if you do choose to export identities along with nodes, the associations between identities and nodes will persist along with the transfer. That is, you will not have to perform the extra step of clicking on nodes and associating an admin identity with them.\n* It is necessary that all of the members of a channel have the MSPs of all of the other members of a channel to allow for the validation of signatures. However, note that by selecting the MSPs button, all MSPs in your console would be exported, not just the MSPs relevant to a particular channel.\n\n\n\nIf you import a bulk data transfer of nodes and do not also import identities, you will have to perform the separate step of associating identities with the nodes. There are a few ways to procure an identity that can operate a node.

Regardless of the process used to acquire the identity, after the bulk import has been completed you will need to click on each imported node. For peers and ordering nodes, a box on the left of the screen will say Identity not associated with (peer or ordering node), depending on the node in question. After clicking on this box, you will be able to associate the relevant identity by selecting it from your Wallet. Note that this process is distinctly different than the process for importing individual nodes, where you will be asked to associate an identity as part of the import process.\n\nYou will also need to associate an admin identity for the CA. This process is similar to the peer and ordering node process except that after you click on the imported CA you will see a separate screen asking you to associate an identity rather than a box on the left.\n\nFor cases where bulk data transfers are impractical or inadvisable, you can follow the steps below to export and import components and identities one at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Gathering certificates or credentials \n\nBecause identities contain private keys, be careful when exporting them to ensure they are handled securely. If a private key is compromised, it can be used to perform malicious actions.\n\nEach IBM Blockchain Platform component is deployed with the signing certificate of an administrator inside. When actions requiring the permission level of an admin are performed against the component, the signing certificate of the entity attempting the action is checked against the signing certificate inside the node. If they don't match, the action is denied. In this way, these certificates, which are also known as \"keys\", allow the administrator to operate their components.\n\nIf you intend to operate an imported node, you have two options:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-import-nodes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10596-9883-11854","score":23.3619414113,"text":"\nIf they are in a Normal state, add back any deleted components and re-create any reverted changes, one by one, until you can determine which configuration or component caused the worker node disruption.\n7.

A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16026-0-358","score":16.4790527265,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  VNF limitations \n\nHigh Availability (HA) Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployments have the following known limitations.\n\n\n\n*  The Virtual Network Function (VNF) must share one subnet with the Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n*  Routing public internet \"ingress\" traffic to a VNF is not supported.\n*  Auto-scaling with the VNF is not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vnf-limitations"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07953-7-2429","score":15.7069120467,"text":"\nEnsuring isolation between Satellite management functions and workload functions \n\nA key aspect of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services is to separate user workloads from system management functions and isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.

Place control plane hosts into a separate network segment. Control plane hosts support various management and security-related components of the Satellite location. To facilitate effective network flow restrictions within the Satellite location, it is recommended to place control plane hosts into a separate network segment (whether physical or virtual) that can enable clear identification of source or destination of the network flows related to control plane functionality. The control plane hosts can be deployed to different physical locations, but the address space they are assigned to should provide an easy way to identify this group of hosts (for example, CIDR blocks).\n2. Designate a separate network segment for each group of Satellite hosts assigned to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud workload clusters. Satellite hosts that are assigned to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud workload clusters (workload hosts) should use their own network segments that would enable network flow control and monitoring between workload hosts, control plane, and other components outside of the Satellite location. It is recommended to designate a separate network segment (virtual subnet, VLAN, or a similar entity) for each group of Satellite hosts assigned to the same workload cluster.\n3.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-connectivity-management-isolation"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16030-4758-6868","score":15.6838749739,"text":"\nInter-subnet, inter-zone data flows - For these flows, the implicit router function removes the VNI and forwards the packet in the VPC's MPLS VPN for transit across the cloud backbone.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

This practice is costly in terms of performance, as every lookup is a full scan of the database rather than an indexed lookup. If your data is small, this full-scan lookup doesn\u2019t matter, but as the data set grows, performance becomes a problem for you, and for the cluster as a whole. It is likely that we will limit this facility soon. The IBM Cloudant Dashboard provides a method for creating indexes in an easy way.\n\nCreating indexes and crafting IBM Cloudant Queries that take advantage of them requires some flair. To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index. Some examples exist where this type of indexing is abused either deliberately, or mostly by mistake. Plan your indexing to comprise only the fields required by your actual queries. Indexes take up space and can be costly to rebuild if the number of indexed fields are large.\n\nWe also have the issue of which fields that you store in an IBM Cloudant Search.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04339-5327-6381","score":16.7387558305,"text":"\nRequired.\n\nAllowable list items are: management, data.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00491-1283-3050","score":16.4459611584,"text":"\n(Optional) [Create an acurl alias](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-working-with-curlencode-user-name-and-password).\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to set up acurl, use the following URL with curl instead of the one provided in the exercises, curl \"https:\/\/$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\/databasedemo\".\n\nThe acurl alias is more secure. It prevents someone from reading your password over your shoulder as you type.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00539-4998-6652","score":16.3780553568,"text":"\nWhen you execute a query, passing execution_stats: true as an extra parameter forces IBM Cloudant to enumerate the number of documents it scanned in performing the query, for example:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"sort\": [\"date\"],\n\"limit\": 10,\n\"execution_stats\": true\n}\n\nThe returned data now includes an extra JSON object:\n\n{\n...\n\"execution_stats\": {\n\"total_keys_examined\": 0,\n\"total_docs_examined\": 1000000,\n\"total_quorum_docs_examined\": 0,\n\"results_returned\": 2,\n\"execution_time_ms\": 4400.699\n}\n}\n\nThe ratio between total_docs_examined and results_returned is key here: a high value indicates that too many documents are being scanned per document that is returned.\n\nFor more information, see [Blog post on Optimizing IBM Cloudant Queries](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2020\/04\/24\/Optimising-Cloudant-Queries.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n Which IBM Cloudant Query operators defeat the use of an index? \n\nAny of the [combination operators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryoperators) other than $and can make a query do a full database scan without the help of a secondary index. For example, if an $or operator is used, then no secondary index can be used to assist the query. If in doubt, use the [POST \/{db}\/_explain](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudant?code=javapostexplain) endpoint to check that an index is used, and the execution_stats: true parameter to measure the efficiency of each query.\n\nFor a type=json index to be used to support a query, it must match the fields that are used in the selector and sort parameters.

This empty message triggers the Greet customer action, which typically sends a welcome message.\n\nRather than starting the conversation with a generic greeting, you might want your users to see a prompt that is specific to the page they are already viewing. For example, if a user has already navigated to a page about credit cards and then opens the web chat, you might want to start the conversation with a message that is specific to credit cards.\n\nAlthough this example shows how to adapt the text based on the current page, you can use the same basic approach to adapt the text based on any client condition (such as the time of day or the user's geographical location).\n\nTo change the greeting action based on the current page the user is viewing, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Determine what page the user is currently viewing. Depending on the design of your application, there are various ways to do this, but one simple mechanism is to check the value of a URL query parameter (in this example, page):\n\nconst page = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('page');\n2.

Some services require a functional ID when you create service instances, for example the Kubernetes Service.\n\nA functional ID is a type of user ID that exists in your Identity Provider's (IdP) user directory, but it's not tied to a specific user. To create a functional ID, you must create a new user in the user directory and invite them to your IBM Cloud account.\n\nThe functional ID is used to create service instances, like Kubernetes Service clusters. This way, instances aren't linked to a specific person that might leave the company, which would leave the instance without an owner. Generally, functional IDs can do more in IBM Cloud than a service ID. For example, functional IDs, like user IDs, can be granted access to services and applications through access policies.\n\nIBM Cloud API keys for users can be created and associated with a functional ID. If a service requires a user API key for interacting with other services or applications, use the functional ID API key. By using the API key that is associated with the functional ID, you can provide only the access that is needed for that service.\n\nIf you're using a functional ID as the account owner, instead consider [Setting an alternative account owner](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-classic-infra-owner&interface=ui). This is available only for classic infrastructure accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Service IDs \n\nService IDs are another type of identity that is used in an account. Service IDs are used to provide a separate identity for services and applications. Service IDs are best used when an application or service needs a digital identity and needs access to only IAM-enabled resources. You can create a service ID to be used by an application that needs access to your IBM Cloud services so that individual user credentials don't need to be used.\n\n\n\n Service ID API keys","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-identity-overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

See [Annotating document sets directly](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotating-document-sets-directly).\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nThe annotation task specifies which documents are to be annotated. To compare how well the human annotators perform, and to see how consistently they apply the annotation guidelines, you must include at least two human annotators in the task. In addition, some percentage of documents must occur in all of the annotation sets that you add to the task (you specify the overlap percentage when you create the annotation sets).\n\n\n\n Important \n\n\n\n* An annotation task is a temporal concept that exists to allow human annotators to annotate text in isolated spaces. It also ensures that annotations must be approved before they are promoted to ground truth.\n* An annotation set can be included in one active task at a time. To add an annotation set in one task to a different task, you must first delete the task where the annotation set is active.\n* If you delete a human annotator's user account, it affects their annotations too. Any annotations in documents that were assigned to that user but were not promoted to ground truth are deleted.\n* If the type system or ground truth editor settings change after you create a human annotation task, you must decide whether to propagate the changes to the task.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documents"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

After you create a machine learning model, you can use the model to pre-annotate new documents that you add to the corpus. Pre-annotation is a process of machine-annotating a document to the extent possible before a machine learning model is available to do so. Pre-annotation can reduce human-annotation labor by replacing some human annotation creation with mere verification of the correctness of machine annotation.\n* Dividing documents among human annotators, who then use the IBM Watson\u00ae Knowledge Studio ground truth editor tool to manually add annotations to small sets of documents.\n* Comparing the human annotation results and resolving conflicts. Adjudication in this phase is needed to ensure accurate and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth, where they can be used to train and test a machine learning model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Model development \n\nThis stage refers to the use of Knowledge Studio tools to create a model.

The results generated by the model are evaluated against a test set of ground truth documents. Accuracy analysis identifies the causes of annotation errors.

For example, it is easier to recognize asbestos as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of squash, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.\n\nDictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes.

Red Hat OpenShift mainly automates the rotation process, but requires manual approval of certificate signing requests (CSRs). Therefore, it is important that you understand the Red Hat OpenShift certificate rotation schedule to avoid expired certificates.\n\nThe initial certificates that are created during installation expire 24 hours after they are created. IBM's automation process, which installs Red Hat OpenShift, handles the approval of the CSRs for this initial rotation, which is done by running a script on the bastion for the first 30 hours. The script is named \/root\/approve-csr.sh and its log file is named \/root\/approve-csr.log.\n\nFor the script to run successfully, the initial kubeadmin credentials must be the same until the initial certificate rotation is complete. Do not change the kubeadmin credentials for the first 24 hours. If the credentials are changed, you must monitor and approve the CSRs for the initial certificate rotation. For more information, see [Approving the CSRs for your machines](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.7\/installing\/installing_vsphere\/installing-vsphere.htmlinstallation-approve-csrs_installing-vsphere).\n\nDo not restart any of the Red Hat OpenShift cluster virtual machines (VMs) or the bastion VM until the first certificate rotation is done.\n\nAfter the initial certificate rotation, certificates are renewed every 30 days. You must establish a process to approve the CSRs for every certificate rotation. According to Red Hat\u00ae, you can approve CSRs when they reach 80% of their expiration period, which is approximately 25 days into the lifespan of the CSRs.\n\nIf you do not approve CSRs in time and the certificates expire, you can recover from expired control plane certificates and get the Red Hat OpenShift cluster operational again.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-ocp_managing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14493-7-1757","score":27.3701499308,"text":"\nRed Hat OpenShift Bastion node setup \n\nTo enable the deployment, a virtual machine (VM) is provisioned to run the Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae installation steps and host an HTTP Server.

This applies to any services that has suffered a irrecoverable failure. If the dependent services were not affected, all that is required is to ensure that the network connectivity between the Data Security Broker deployment and the dependent services is restored.\n\nSince Data Security Broker Manager contains all the configuration and metadata needed for a Data Security Broker deployment, the goal of the process is to restore Data Security Broker Manager to a previous state so that a new shield can be deployed to enforce the previously configured security policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n Restoring Data Security Broker Manager deployed on a Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift cluster to a previous state \n\nA new Data Security Broker Manager deployment needs to be set up in a Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift cluster, in order to return Data Security Broker Manager to its previous state.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16242-7-2224","score":23.325015945,"text":"\nResponse modes \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nYou can choose a response mode for each action to set how it behaves. The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings.

An Edge Bridge profile specifies which Edge cluster to use for bridging and which Edge transport node acts as the primary and backup bridge.\n2. You need to have a new VLAN for the bridged devices. After the VLAN is provisioned, you can request to trunk the hosts. VLAN must be trunked to all hosts in your cluster through IBM Cloud Classic portal (Classic Infrastructure > Network > Gateway appliances). Then, add the ESX hosts to a wanted NSX-T VLAN transport zone, for example tz-bridge.\n3.

Users must add explicit drop rules if the default behavior is not desired.\n\nThe VRA provides a basic CPP rule set as template. You can merge it into your configuration by running:\n\nvyatta@vrouter merge \/opt\/vyatta\/etc\/cpp.conf\n\nAfter this rule set is merged, a new firewall rule set named CPP is added and applied to the loopback interface.

In zone-based firewall operation an interface is assigned to a zone (only one zone per interface) and firewall rule sets are assigned to the boundaries between zones with the idea that all interfaces within a zone have the same security level and are allowed to route freely. Traffic is only scrutinized when it is passing from one zone to another. Zones drop any traffic coming into them which is not explicitly allowed.\n\nAn interface can either belong to a zone or have a per-interface firewall configuration; an interface cannot do both.\n\nImagine the following office scenario with three departments, each department with its own VLAN:\n\n\n\n* Department A - VLANs 10 and 20 (interface dp0bond1.10 and dp0bond1.20)\n* Department B - VLANs 30 and 40 (interface dp0bond1.30 and dp0bond1.40)\n* Department C - VLAN 50 (interface dp0bond1.50)\n\n\n\nA zone can be created for each department and the interfaces for that department can be added to the zone.

However it is important to note that since these firewall devices are connected with 2 Gbps Uplink, IBM recommends scaling the number of firewall instances to meet the performance needs of your application. You can do so by deploying extra public VLAN Firewalls within a pod to allow for additional firewall and associated compute resources to be added.\n* What VPN options are included with each Firewall product?\n\nNot all firewalls offer VPN and not all VPN options are the same. The general options for VPN are:\n\n\n\n* Each customer receives unlimited SSL VPN connections to IBM's private network. These connections can be established by clicking the VPN link at the top of the page while logged in to the Cloud Catalog console.\n* IBM Cloud also offers a basic multi-tenant IPsec VPN service.\n* The FortiGate Security Appliance 1 Gbps provides SSL and IPsec VPN options with Public network access only (no access to the IBM Cloud private network).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04109-7-2036","score":16.8955105182,"text":"\nAssigning firewall rule actions \n\nFirewall rule actions tell CIS how to respond to requests that match the criteria you define.\n\nFor lightweight firewall rules, navigate to Security > IP firewall, which contains IP rules, User Agent rules, and Domain Lockdown rules.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

By using this flow, you can securely authenticate users on your app to provide personalized user experiences across devices.\n\n\n\n What is the flow's technical basis? \n\nSince native applications are installed directly on a user's device, private user information and application credentials can be extracted by third-parties with relative ease. By default, these types of applications are known as untrusted clients as they cannot store global credentials or user refresh tokens. As a result, untrusted clients require users to input their credentials every time their access tokens expire.\n\nTo convert your application into a trusted client, App ID uses [Dynamic Client Registration](https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc6749). Before an application instance begins authenticating users, it first registers as an OAuth2 client with App ID. Because of client registration, your application receives an installation-specific client ID that can be digitally signed and used to authorize requests with App ID. Since App ID stores your application's corresponding public key, it can validate your request signature that allows your application to be viewed as a confidential client. This process minimizes your application's risk of exposing credentials indefinitely and greatly improves the user experience by allowing automatic token refresh.\n\nFollowing registration, your users authenticate by using either the OAuth2 authorization code or resource owner password[authorization grant](https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc6749section-1.3) flows to authenticate users.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dynamic client registration \n\n\n\n1.

It's important to distinguish how each action is triggered. When a user enters a question or request, the phrase is evaluated across all the Customer starts with examples in every action. If two actions have similar phrase examples, then the wrong action might get triggered by your user's question.\n\n\n\n Confidence scoring \n\nBehind the scenes, Watson Assistant determines a confidence score for each phrase. The score is absolute, meaning that a confidence score is assigned based on a predetermined scale, and not relative to other customer phrases.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16268-7-2150","score":22.5761562086,"text":"\nUsing autolearning to improve assistant responses \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nUse autolearning to enable your assistant to learn from interactions with your customers and improve responses.\n\nWhen customers interact with your assistant, they often make choices. Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

If the customer picks this choice, the assistant uses your Fallback action.\n\nStep validation attempts before offering support: If a customer provides invalid answers for a step in an action, the assistant can offer to connect to other support in the Fallback action.

In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active\/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active\/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02898-0-1202","score":16.1952140076,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Planning the dialog \n\nLearn how to approach building a dialog.\n\n\n\n*  Plan out the design of the dialog that you want to build before you add a single dialog node.

A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active\/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active\/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16262-7-2107","score":30.7377370417,"text":"\nAccessing context data in dialog \n\nThe context is an object that contains variables that persist throughout a conversation and can be shared by the dialog and the client application.

For more information, see the [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2message).\n* If you use the stateless v2 message API (or the legacy v1 message API) your application is responsible for storing the context after each conversation turn and sending it back to the service with the next message.

Pick your assistant's domain of expertise \n\nDecide which general domain of expertise you want your assistant to cover (for example, billing support or scheduling appointments). To make an informed decision, review any support call logs that you have access to or ask your customer service representatives.

For example, don\u2019t choose to automate billing support questions if you're unable to add the web chat client to the billing web pages.\n\nAfter you select a domain, you can decide which specific questions or tasks the assistant will help customers with. Start small. Pick one or a handful of customer issues that will deliver the highest value to start. It might be valuable for your assistant to answer a simple question that is asked all the time. Or maybe there's a task, such as scheduling appointments, that you can offload to the assistant to tackle incoming customer requests.\n\nChoose a narrow set of user goals first. If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

You can verify if a cluster does or does not use a system channel by clicking the cluster's tile and looking near the Orderer Type text.\n\nJoining an orderer to an application channel will make it either a follower or a consenter. It will be a consenter if the node is found in the the channel's config block in the consenters section. Otherwise the orderer will be a follower. Both types of orderers will receive transaction\/block data, but only a consenter can vote and play a role in the consensus algorithm. A node can be promoted from a follower to a consenter by first joining it to the channel, and then editing the channel's config to add it as a consenter. Similarly these steps can be reversed to demote an orderer and unjoin it completely if need be.\n\nJoining an orderer to the application channel can be started by clicking the cluster's tile.

The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location. Alternatively, you can secure the information with a password, but this reduces security, depending on the level of your password's strength.\n\nAccessibility If your key file is lost, your data is also lost.

This requirement is addressed by a validation function present in the default design document of the replicator database. The function validates each document update. This validation function also ensures that a nonadmin user can't set a username property in the user_ctx property that doesn't correspond to the correct username. The same principle also applies for roles.\n\nSee the following example delegated replication document:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"my_rep\",\n\"source\": \"https:\/\/$ACCOUNT:$PASSWORD@$SERVER.com:5984\/foo\",\n\"target\": \"https:\/\/$ACCOUNT:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\/bar\",\n\"continuous\": true,\n\"user_ctx\": {\n\"name\": \"joe\",\n\"roles\": [\"erlanger\", \"researcher\"]\n}\n}\n\nFor admins, the user_ctx property is optional.

You can use the \/dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the \/dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2. Add a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step. Choose Connect to human agent as the response type.\n\nFor more information, see [Adding a Connect to human agent response type](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-add-connect-to-human-agent).\n3. Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it. To ensure that a useful summary is provided to service desk agents when a conversation is transferred to them, add short dialog node names that reflect the node's purpose. For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03054-27011-29125","score":17.8050935312,"text":"\nFollow this procedure to make it less likely that the dialog will respond by resetting the confidence level threshold from the default setting of 0.2 to 0.5. Changing the confidence level threshold to 0.5 instructs your assistant to not respond with an answer from the dialog unless the assistant is more than 50% confident that the dialog can understand the user's intent and can address it.\n\n\n\n1. From the Dialog page of your dialog skill, make sure that the last node in the dialog tree has an anything_else condition with a search skill response type.\n\nWhenever this node is processed, the search skill is triggered.\n2. Add a folder to the dialog. Position the folder before the first dialog node that you want to de-emphasize. Add the following condition to the folder:\n\nintents[0].confidence > 0.5\n\nThis condition is applied to all of the nodes in the folder. The condition tells your assistant to process the nodes in the folder only if your assistant is at least 50% confident that it knows the user's intent.\n3. Move any dialog nodes that you do not want your assistant to process often into the folder.\n\n\n\nAfter changing the dialog, test the assistant to make sure the search skill is triggered as often as you want it to be.\n\nAn alternative approach is to teach the dialog about topics to ignore. To do so, you can add utterances that you want the assistant to send to the search skill immediately as test utterances in the dialog skill's Try it out pane. You can then select the Mark as irrevlant option within the Try it out pane to teach the dialog not to respond to this utterance or others like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Disabling search \n\nYou can disable the search skill from being triggered.\n\nYou might want to do so temporarily, while you are setting up the integration. Or you might want to only ever trigger a search for specific user queries that you can identify within the dialog, and use a search skill response type to answer.\n\nTo prevent the search skill from being triggered, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options. When a user clicks one of the options, an associated user input value is sent to your assistant. How options are rendered can differ depending on where you deploy the dialog.

An authoring application uses the API to create and modify skills, intents, entities, dialog nodes, and other artifacts that make up a dialog skill. For more information, see the [v1 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v1).\n\nNote: The v1 authoring methods create and modify workspaces rather than skills. A workspace is a container for the dialog and training data (such as intents and entities) within a dialog skill. If you create a new workspace using the API, it will appear as a new dialog skill in the Watson Assistant user interface.\n\nFor a list of the available API methods, see [API methods summary](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-methods).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03293-18722-20426","score":28.1098123533,"text":"\nAnnotation-based entites are those for which you annotate occurrences of the entity in sample sentences to teach your assistant about the context in which the entity is typically used.\n\nIn order to train a contextual entity model, you can take advantage of your intent examples, which provide readily-available sentences to annotate.\n\nThis feature is generally available in English-language dialog skills and is available as a beta feature in French-langage dialog skills.

By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy \/message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill. The v1 runtime API is supported primarily for backward compatibility purposes.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16364-82764-84754","score":26.9026443676,"text":"\n* For a Phone integration, if you connect to existing speech service instances, make sure those speech services use credentials that were generated with the latest endpoint syntax (a URL that starts with https:\/\/api.{location}.speech-to-text.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/).\n* For a search skill, if you connect to an existing Discovery service instance, make sure the Discovery service uses credentials that were generated with the supported syntax (a URL that starts with https:\/\/api.{location}.discovery.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/).\n* If you are using [Jupyter notebooks](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-logs-resourceslogs-resources-jupyter-logs) to do advanced analytics, check your Jupyter notebook files to make sure they don't specify URLs with the old watsonplatform.net syntax.

This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

For example, an entity might be an instance of an app that runs on a mobile device, a microservice that runs on the cloud, or a component of infrastructure that runs that microservice. For any entity to interact with App Configuration, it must provide a unique entity ID. This task is most easily accomplished by programming your app or microservice to send the Entity ID by using the App Configuration SDK.\n\nAPI Call - An API call is the invocation of the App Configuration through a programmable interface.\n\nExactly what constitutes an API call varies depending on the entity type (for example, a microservice or a mobile app). For server-side entities like microservices, when the state of a feature flag or property changes in the App Configuration, a websocket connection notifies the SDK in the microservice that a state change occurred. The microservice then calls back into the App Configuration to retrieve the update. This action is an API call.\n\nAn API call also occurs on startup to the retrieve the initial configuration state.

Peers and ordering nodes take longer to deploy, but this condition can also occur when the health checker that runs against the peer or ordering nodes cannot contact the node.

The parameters specify the service's sensitivity to non-speech events and to background noise. The parameters are independent: You can use them individually or together.\n\nSpeech activity detection is supported for most language models. For more information, see [Language model support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-inputdetection-support).\n\n\n\n How speech activity detection works \n\nSpeech activity detection consumes the input audio stream and determines which parts of the stream to pass for speech recognition. Speech recognition is adversely affected by background speech and noise, causing the service to transcribe the wrong words, to produce words where none are present, or to omit words that are part of the input audio. The speech activity detection feature can help ensure that only relevant audio is processed for speech recognition.\n\nYou can use the feature to control the following aspects of speech recognition:\n\n\n\n* Suppress background speech. Call-center data often contains cross-talk (\"overhearing\") from other agents. You can set a volume threshold below which such background speech is ignored.\n* Suppress background noise. Some audio, such as speech recorded in a factory, can contain a high level of background noise. You can set a threshold below which such background noise is ignored.\n* Suppress non-speech audio events. Background music and tone events, such as audio played to a client who is waiting on hold on a telephone line, can cause inaccurate recognition. Silence can also result in unnecessary recognition or transcription errors. You can set a threshold below which such events are ignored.\n\n\n\nBy default, speech activity detection is configured to provide optimal performance for the general case for each model. For specific cases, the default settings might not be optimal and can lead either to slow transcription or to word insertions and deletions. You are encouraged to experiment with different settings to determine which values work best for your audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity \n\nUse the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter to adjust the sensitivity of speech activity detection.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16364-192793-195089","score":19.1123720666,"text":"\nThe name you specify is saved as a title attribute of the node in the workspace JSON file and the system uses a unique ID that is stored in the name attribute to reference the node.\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 August 2017 \n\nUpdates to Korean, Japanese, and Italian\n: Language support has been enhanced for Korean, Japanese, and Italian.

If you require virtual server placement, you need to provision them on dedicated hosts as dedicated host instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n What type of server, virtual or bare metal, supports the dedicated host offering? \n\nThe offering is supported on virtual servers; IBM Cloud does have a bare metal offering. The differences between virtual hosts and bare metal servers are the time to provision and virtualization management.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the provisioning lifecycle of a dedicated host? \n\nDedicated hosts are allocated to users when provisioned. They persist to the account until it is reclaimed. Dedicated hosts are offered in only on-demand pricing, hourly or monthly, so when reclaimed, billing models charge as either hourly or monthly IBM Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is the dedicated host offering billed? \n\nYou can purchase dedicated hosts on-demand with hourly or monthly billing. Hourly only hosts allow only hourly instances to be provisioned; monthly only hosts allow provisioning of monthly and hourly instances.

Premium operating systems, storage area network (SAN) storage, and software add-on prices and licensing are charged based on the instance deployed\u2014hourly or monthly\u2014on the dedicated host.

Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage. If you store more than 20 GB, you're charged a defined cost per GB per hour.\n\nRefer to the IBM Cloud Pricing Calculator in the dashboard for pricing at different capacities and currencies, and the [pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricingpricing) information for examples to estimate costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dedicated Hardware plan","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.3868528072,"ndcg_cut_5":0.3868528072,"ndcg_cut_10":0.5802792109}}

When you delete the Lite plan instance, all of the data that is associated with that instance is deleted and isn't recoverable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-nosecondlite"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1323355-1325090","score":12.7601021564,"text":"\nSelect the \"standard\" plan and hit save.\n\nIn cases where the instance has been locked due to exceeding the maximum allowed size of a Lite instance it may be necessary to use the CLI.

If you already have one Lite plan instance, you can't create a second Lite plan instance, or change a Standard plan instance to a Lite plan. If you try, you see the following message. You can have only one instance of a Lite plan per service. To create a new instance, either delete your existing Lite plan instance or select a paid plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Standard plan \n\nThe IBM Cloudant Standard plan is available to all paid IBM Cloud\u00ae accounts, either as pay-as-you-go or subscription, and scales to meet the needs of your application. The Standard plan is priced based on two factors: the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated, and the amount of data that is stored in the instance.\n\nPricing is pro-rated hourly with a starting provisioned throughput capacity of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. This rate is equal to a starting cost of USD $0.105 per hour. You can toggle the provisioned throughput capacity up or down by using the user interface or API. Toggle in increments of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage. If you store more than 20 GB, you're charged a defined cost per GB per hour.\n\nRefer to the IBM Cloud Pricing Calculator in the dashboard for pricing at different capacities and currencies, and the [pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricingpricing) information for examples to estimate costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dedicated Hardware plan","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price.

Following are the three key concepts in RAID:\n\n\n\n* Mirroring: copying data to more than one disk\n* Striping: splitting data across more than one disk\n* Error correction (fault tolerance): redundant data is stored to allow problems to be detected and possibly fixed.\n\n\n\nAlthough many different levels of RAID exist, IBM chooses to support the most common RAID types: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity \/ Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read\/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05138-7979-9034","score":21.2538512409,"text":"\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

This process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-sa-3"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16324-1477-3681","score":15.4821192885,"text":"\nIf you have an existing interactive voice response (IVR) system with a branching structure (\u201cpress 1 for billing, press 2 for payments\u201d), you might choose the [phone integration](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone) as your initial channel.

Pick your assistant's domain of expertise \n\nDecide which general domain of expertise you want your assistant to cover (for example, billing support or scheduling appointments). To make an informed decision, review any support call logs that you have access to or ask your customer service representatives. After you choose a domain, be sure that it aligns with a channel that you can control and change. For example, don\u2019t choose to automate billing support questions if you're unable to add the web chat client to the billing web pages.\n\nAfter you select a domain, you can decide which specific questions or tasks the assistant will help customers with. Start small. Pick one or a handful of customer issues that will deliver the highest value to start. It might be valuable for your assistant to answer a simple question that is asked all the time. Or maybe there's a task, such as scheduling appointments, that you can offload to the assistant to tackle incoming customer requests.\n\nChoose a narrow set of user goals first. If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant. After your assistant is live, the built-in metrics of active user conversations help you understand what your customers are asking about, how well your assistant is able to meet their needs, and what to focus on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":27.5699817071,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":24.0330873963,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":39.4870591511,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04170-1738-2974","score":22.866861271,"text":"\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-1672-3877","score":35.9293287918,"text":"\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":29.4427897417,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":43.578338459,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04107-6095-8145","score":22.2839444262,"text":"\nThis tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01533-4-2366","score":35.7414609712,"text":"\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00882-2700-4149","score":36.0641299708,"text":"\nibmcloud doi testrecord-publish --logicalappname \"$MY_APP_NAME\" --buildnumber \"$MY_BUILD_NUMBER\" --filelocation \".\/Report-final.xml\" --type staticsecurityscan\n\nChange the type to dynamicsecurityscan if the report is from a dynamic scan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Uploading SonarQube results \n\nTo upload data from SonarQube, you must provide the SonarQube server token by using --token.

If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor. For more information, see [Getting started with Security and Compliance Center](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\nUsing Portieris to block the deployment of images with issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor is deprecated.\n\n\n\n About Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor provides functions to help you to secure your images.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines.

When specified in combination with PARTITIONED INTO, the same is done, which is often referred to as clustering the rows by the specified columns into the fixed number of partitions specified by PARTITIONED INTO. When specified without the PARTITIONED clause, it is equivalent to an ORDER BY clause specified at the top level of the SQL SELECT statement. If PARTITIONED INTO is specified, the ORDER BY clause is ignored.\n\n\n\n Partition by columns \n\nWhen you use the PARTITIONED BY (column-list) clause without specifying INTO x BUCKETS\/OBJECTS, you can store the query result by using Hive-style partitioning, which is to create partitions that contain only rows that have certain values for one or more columns. Choose this physical layout if the stored object is further analyzed by using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.\n\nFor example, a result object that contains worldwide order data has a column country to represent the country that the order is initiated from. Partitioning the result object by the column PARTITIONED BY (country), would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.\n\nWhen the result object is stored this way on Cloud Object Storage, each SQL query that contains a predicate, such as country = 'USA' or country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY'), benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during SQL query execution partitions must be read only if they contain data for the countries of interest. This layout tremendously cuts down the I\/O traffic of the SQL query.\n\nSee the following extra remarks on Hive-style partitioning.\n\n\n\n* Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme because the column names that are used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, \/order\/COUNTRY=USA\/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet.\n* Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are stored in the object prefix of the partition. Thus, if you copy a HIVE-style partition and rename the object prefix by removing the partition column values, you lose data.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13480-4908-6825","score":17.3240714411,"text":"\nIncorrect column name specification results in an empty column, that is, the column seems to contain no data.

By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds. The level of precision is not restricted, so you can specify values such as 0.25 and 0.125. The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request.

If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number.

This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.

Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16034-7-1778","score":16.8156480091,"text":"\nVPC CLI release notes \n\nThe following release notes are for the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) command line interface (CLI).\n\n\n\n v6.15.0 \n\nVersion 6.15.0 was released on 2023-07-11.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* New commands image-obsolete and image-deprecate are introduced to support image lifecycle management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for image lifecycle management in image-create, image-update, and images commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.14.1 \n\nVersion 6.14.1 was released on 2023-06-30.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* Fixed issue with using the SSH key generated from UI in CLI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.14.0 \n\nVersion 6.14.0 was released on 2023-06-23.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for more algorithms in the SSH key key-create command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.13.0 \n\nVersion 6.13.0 was released on 2023-06-22.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for snapshot and backup cross region copy in snaphot-create, snapshots, backup-policy-plan-create and backup-policy-plan-update commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.12.0 \n\nVersion 6.12.0 was released on 2023-06-01.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for fileshare mount targets in share commands (Beta).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* Fixed bare-metal-server-network-interfaces, bare-metal-server-profiles and bare-metal-servers commands to print correct response values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.11.1 \n\nVersion 6.11.1 was released on 2023-05-03.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-cli-rn"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16446-7-1856","score":16.6137159035,"text":"\nRelease notes \n\nThe following new features and changes to IBM Watson\u2122 Knowledge Studio for IBM Cloud Pak\u00ae for Data are available.\n\nFor details about what's new, see the IBM Cloud Pak for Data documentation.\n\n\n\n* [4.5.x](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/docs\/SSQNUZ_4.5.x\/fixlist\/wks-fixlist.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n Version 1.2.0 (9 December 2020) \n\n\n\n* Security and stability fixes\n\n\n\n* Several security fixes and stability enhancements have been introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Version 1.1.3 (31 August 2020) \n\n\n\n* Security and stability fixes\n\n\n\n* Several security fixes and stability enhancements have been introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Version 1.1.2 (19 June 2020) \n\n\n\n* Enhanced pre-annotation workflow.\n\n\n\n* Run multiple pre-annotators at once and configure the order of pre-annotators to resolve annotation conflicts between them.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07844-3757-5369","score":13.3970656526,"text":"\nRA-5 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (c) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes acceptance tests to validate every deployment<br><br><br>","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07844-2925-4586","score":13.3067207231,"text":"\nRA-5 (a) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br>","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1213887-1215935","score":13.2639969882,"text":"\nAfter you delete your Key Protect instance, Key Protect uses[envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption) to crypto-shred any data that is associated with the Key Protect instance.\n* Why does the user interface show unauthorized access?\n\nSetting and retrieving the network access policy is only supported through the application programming interface (API).

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06843-4238-6198","score":16.881097636,"text":"\nThis command returns either cc, cd, ci, or pr, depending on which pipeline is running.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06843-4238-6198","score":30.3551977288,"text":"\nThis command returns either cc, cd, ci, or pr, depending on which pipeline is running.

This topic provides a high-level overview of the platform components that your service uses, and pulls these concepts together into an end-to-end provisioning scenario.\n\n\n\n The IBM Cloud provisioning layer \n\nThe provisioning layer manages the lifecycle of IBM Cloud resources. The provisioning layer is responsible for controlling and tracking the lifecycle of resources in a customer account. Resources are physical or logical components that can be created or reserved for an application or service instance. Examples of resources include database, accounts, processor, memory, and storage limits. In general, resources that are tracked by the provisioning layer are intended to associate usage metrics and billing, but that isn\u2019t always the case. In some cases, the resource might be associated to the provisioning layer to ensure that the resource lifecycle can be managed along with the account lifecycle.\n\n\n\n Resource lifecycle management \n\nThe provisioning layer provides common APIs to control the lifecycle of resources from creation (creating an instance) to binding (creating access credentials) to unbinding (removing access) to deletion (deleting an instance). Additionally, the IBM Cloud platform provides CLIs and a UI that can manage the lifecycle of these resources that don\u2019t require you to create your own facilities.\n\nThe provisioning layer provides APIs to help you manage the following elements of your resource lifecycle:\n\n\n\n* Creating a resource instance\n* Updating a resource instance\n* Binding\n* Resource keys\n* Unbinding\n* Deleting a resource instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nIdentity Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely authenticate users and control access to all cloud resources consistently across IBM Cloud.

You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09979-1428-3421","score":20.869547195,"text":"\n* password: xxxx - Specifies the password that you must use when logging in to your instance as admin.\n\n\n\nAfter you log in to your instance for the first time, change your admin password.\n\n\n\nTo view credentials, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03166-23681-24372","score":21.8355069181,"text":"\nFor Lite plans, usage is measured by the number of \/message calls (API) are sent to the assistant from the web chat integration.

Additionally, you can enforce rate limits through Plans or through operations within a Plan's APIs that override the Plan's rate limit.\n\nPlans can also specify billing costs for customers who use your Products. For example, you can define three different Plans for a single Product. Each Plan can have a different subscription cost and a different rate limit that targets different customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Products \n\nPlans and APIs are grouped in Products. Through Products, you can manage the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans. Use the API Designer to create, edit, and stage your Product. Use the API Manager to manage the lifecycle of your Product.\n\nThe following diagram demonstrates how Products, Plans, and APIs relate to one another. Note how Plans belong to only one Product, can possess different APIs to other Plans within the same Product, and can share APIs with Plans from any Product.

A lifecycle manager can then control the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans through the API Manager. Through the Developer Portal, the customer is then able to subscribe to one of the Plans that is available to them, as determined in the API Manager. If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3333333333}}

If you need more sophisticated monitoring, create an IBM Cloud Monitoring instance from the [Observability](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/observe) section of the IBM Cloud console.\n* How to predict App Configuration cost?\n\nThe simplest way to estimate cost for any IBM Cloud managed service is to use the [IBM Cloud Cost Estimator tool](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost).\n\nGuidelines to help you predict cost in more detail:\n\nThe Application Instance cost is a fixed monthly cost. If you delete an App Configuration instance mid-month, the monthly Application Instance charge is pro-rated. To predict month instance cost, you must be aware of the number of App Configuration instances you have and what pricing plan is assigned to each.\n\nSee all your existing instances in the IBM Cloud Console Resource List in the Services Section. Determine your plan either by clicking the Resource List row that contains your App Configuration instance to reveal an information slide-out, or go to the instance dashboard and look in the Plan section.\n\nSome App Configuration pricing plans have a monthly Application Instance price and others do not. If the plan you select has an instance price, the price for the instance includes a set number of entity IDs and API calls that are included in the instance price. If you exceed the included allotment, your instance continues to operate normally but you accumulate an overage charge based on the published rate for entity IDs and API calls.\n\nThe Active Entity ID cost is based on the number of unique entities that interact with your App Configuration instance during the month. Entities self-identify when an API call is made, and each instance of your application provides a unique entity ID.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02665-5090-7240","score":25.6755403438,"text":"\nSee all your existing instances in the IBM Cloud Console Resource List in the Services Section.

After the subscription expires, your account is converted to a Pay-As-You Go account, which means you pay only for billable services that you use with no contracts or commitments. The discounts that are associated with the subscription account won't apply to the Pay-As-You-Go account. The IBM Sales team is happy to help extend your subscription before you reach its expiration date. If you extend your subscription within 30 days from the expiration date, you won't get charged at the Pay-As-You-Go account rate. After 30 days, you are invoiced as a Pay-As-You-Go account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03704-8977-10890","score":21.1363849804,"text":"\nTo apply your promo code, go to the [Promotions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/promotions) page in the console, enter your promo code, and click Apply.
