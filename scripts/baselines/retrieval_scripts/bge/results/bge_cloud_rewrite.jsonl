related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06480-1160-2754", "score": 0.7192419767379761, "text": "\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https://developer.ibm.com/depmodels/cloud/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/training/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/35-Connectivity.svg)](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/publiccloud/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06501-7-1686", "score": 0.714867353439331, "text": "\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way. It has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database.

You can use a json or text type of index with IBM Cloudant.\n\nIn the following cases, you can specify how the index is created by making it of type json:\n\n\n\n* You know exactly what data you want to look for.\n* You want to keep storage and processing requirements to a minimum.\n\n\n\nBut for maximum flexibility when you search for data, you typically create an index of type text. Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to /$DATABASE/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body. The type field of the JSON object must be set to json. A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST /$DATABASE/_index HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00512-24512-26257", "score": 0.736530065536499, "text": "\npanic(err)\n}\n\nb, _ := json.MarshalIndent(findResult, \"\", \" \")\nfmt.Println(string(b))\n\nThe previous Go example requires the following import block:\n\nimport (\n\"encoding/json\"\n\"fmt\"\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nAll Go examples require the service object to be initialized. For more information, see the API documentation's [Authentication section](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=goauthentication-with-external-configuration) for examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding the infrastructure ID for a device \n\nThe two queries we've yet to perform are shown in the following list:\n\n\n\n1. Readings for all time for a specific device.\n2. Readings for today for a specific device.\n\n\n\nFor these two queries, you need to find the partition for the devices by using the global by-device index. Then, you can query the individual partition for readings. While you might use a global index to query for the readings for individual devices, the mapping from device to infrastructure ID is highly cache-able. It never changes! With this approach, you can mostly use the cheaper and more efficient partitioned query for most requests.\n\nUsing a global index to query directly for device readings might be more efficient if caching the device to infrastructure mapping doesn't work well for a specific application.\n\nTo find the relevant partition for a device, you query the by-device view, sending the device ID as the key:\n\ncurl -X POST \"$SERVICE_URL/readings/_design/infrastructure-mapping/_view/by-device' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{\n\"keys\": [\"device-123456\"], \"limit\": 1\n}'\n\nFor more language examples that show querying a global view, see the [Query a MapReduce view in API Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00512-16550-17838", "score": 0.7354651093482971, "text": "\nFor more information, see the API documentation's [Authentication section](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=goauthentication-with-external-configuration) for examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n Uploading partitioned index by device ID and timestamp \n\nUpload the index by device ID and timestamp to the database by using this command:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl -X POST \"$SERVICE_URL/readings/_index\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n{\"deviceID\": \"asc\"},\n{\"ts\": \"asc\"}\n]\n},\n\"name\": \"deviceID-readings\",\n\"type\": \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}'\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.IndexDefinition;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.IndexField;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.IndexResult;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostIndexOptions;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nIndexField indexField1 = new IndexField.Builder()\n.add(\"deviceID\", \"asc\")\n.build();\n\nIndexField indexField2 = new IndexField.Builder()\n.add(\"ts\", \"asc\")\n.build();\n\nIndexDefinition index = new IndexDefinition.Builder()\n.fields(Arrays.asList(indexField1, indexField2))\n.build();\n\nPostIndexOptions indexOptions = new PostIndexOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"readings\")\n.index(index)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00495-5198-6563", "score": 0.7347894906997681, "text": "\nThis data is used in other tutorials, like [Using IBM Cloudant Query to find data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n1.

If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred.

If configured this way, they pause and reattempt the API call multiple times with exponential back-off.\n\nRetrying such API calls is sensible if you have a temporary and unexpected elevation in traffic.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}]}

IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

The Standard plan is priced based on two factors: the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated, and the amount of data that is stored in the instance.\n\nPricing is pro-rated hourly with a starting provisioned throughput capacity of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. This rate is equal to a starting cost of USD $0.105 per hour. You can toggle the provisioned throughput capacity up or down by using the user interface or API. Toggle in increments of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16295-7-1721", "score": 0.6826924681663513, "text": "\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You can also use a WebView to embed the web chat in your mobile app.\n\nFor detailed reference information about the web chat API, see the web chat [developer documentation](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=).\n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website or a WebView in your mobile app, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source (for more information about the embed script, see [Embedding the web chat on your page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-web-chat)). Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.7022538185119629, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple. Its simplicity also means it can be misused. That's why it's important to verify that the messages sent to your assistant are coming from authorized users only.\n\nBefore you enable security, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Create a RS256 private/public key pair.\n\nYou can use a tool such as the OpenSSL command line or PuTTYgen.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16368-14455-16070", "score": 0.6648873090744019, "text": "\nDepending on whether you have enabled security for the web chat, you can use either the [updateUserID](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodsupdateuserid) instance method or the [updateIdentityToken](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodsupdateidentity) method to specify user identity information.\n\nFor more information about how user identity information is specified and how it is used, see [Managing user identity information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-userid).\n\n\n\n\n\n Security and administration \n\nSecuring the web chat\n: To secure the web chat, you can use JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate users and encrypt private data.

By default, the embed script automatically uses the latest version of the web chat. To avoid unexpected changes that might affect your website, you might want to control which version of the web chat your website uses, giving you an opportunity to test each new version before you deploy in in production., in order to avoid unexpected changes when a new version is released.\n\nFor more information about web chat versioning, see [Controlling the web chat version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-versions).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16298-6367-7794", "score": 0.6607531905174255, "text": "\nFor more information see [Securing the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security).\n2. Encrypt sensitive information that you pass to the web chat.\n\nWhen you enable security in Zendesk, you must provide the name and email address of the current user with each request. Configure the web chat to pass this information in the payload.\n\nSpecify the information by using the following syntax.

You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"></div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-1612-3501", "score": 0.6325903534889221, "text": "\nSets the color of interactive elements, including:\n\n\n\n* Chat launcher button that is embedded in your web page\n* Send button associated with the input text field\n* Input text field border when in focus\n* Marker that shows the start of the assistant\u2019s response\n* Border of a button after it is clicked\n* Border of the drop-down list field as the user chooses an option\n* Typing indicator that is shown to repesent a pause response\n\n\n\n* Assistant image: This image is displayed in the web chat header along with the assistant name to represent your assistant or organization.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-30333-32476", "score": 0.6951584219932556, "text": "\nIn the Message before link to web chat field, edit the introductory message to display to the user (in the originating channel) before the link that initiates the transfer.

Note that the message output that contains the Channel transfer response is processed first by the channel that initiates the transfer, and then by the target channel. If the output contains multiple responses (perhaps using different response types), these will be processed by both channels (before and after the transfer).

Remember that your worker nodes can be only up to two versions behind the master version (n-2).\n\nWhen you replace a worker node, keep in mind the following considerations.\n\nTo update Satellite worker nodes, see [Updating hosts that are assigned as worker nodes to Satellite-enabled services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-update-workers).\n\n\n\n* Multiple worker nodes are replaced concurrently: If you replace multiple worker nodes at the same time, they are deleted and replaced concurrently, not one by one.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS.

If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 / 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained.

With IBM Cloud VPC, you can provision VNF devices to gain better and more affordable scalability than you would by purchasing physical network devices.\n\nTraffic destined for servers in IBM Cloud VPC must be delivered to healthy VNF devices; otherwise, traffic disruption occurs. You can use network load balancers with routing mode to perform health checks and to ensure that workloads only travel through healthy VNF devices. Because of this, network load balancers with routing mode support only VNF devices as back-end targets.\n\nFor detailed examples of various ways you can deploy your NLB with routing mode, refer to [HA VNF deployments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha&interface=ui).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites for NLB with routing mode \n\nTo support routing mode, you must first create a service-to-service authentication policy for your NLB.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested.

For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms.

Each query has one or more associated examples, as described in the following bullet point. Each query must be unique within the training-data set.\n* Example. This is a document indexed in a Discovery collection that acts as an exemplar, good or bad, for the associated query. When you add an example to a training-data query, you include a relevance label that indicates the relevance (or \"goodness\" versus \"badness\") of the document as it applies to the specified query.\n\nExamples are identified by the indexed document ID. As noted, every example must include a label that indicates the \"goodness\" or \"badness\" of the document as it pertains to the query.\n\nExamples can optionally specify a cross-reference query.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search. For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00495-8223-9324", "score": 0.802178144454956, "text": "\nYou can work with the IBM Cloudant API endpoints directly, from within a Python application.\n\nIn this example code, you again request a list of all the documents, including their content.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 0.7865160703659058, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century. The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node.

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions. All objects in the bucket must be set with anonymous read or public read access.\n\nFor more information, see [Accelerate delivery of static files using a CDN](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-static-files-cdn).\n\n\n\n\n\n Path-based CDN mappings", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13464-7165-8908", "score": 0.631441593170166, "text": "\nTS_CROSS_CORRELATION(DoubleTimeSeries, DoubleTimeSeries)\n: Output: DoubleArray\n: Use a [cross correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) algorithm to return a measure of the similarity of two time series.\n\nTS_SEG_CROSS_CORRELATION(DoubleSegmentTimeSeries, DoubleSegmentTimeSeries)\n: Output: DoubleArrayTimeSeries\n: Use a [cross correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) algorithm to return a measure of the similarity of each pair of corresponding segments in the two input time series.

Therefore, the version in cache is considered valid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: For event-driven content, purge your cache \n\nFor example, every time a new post is added to your blog, you could easily purge the CIS cache. It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https://www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com/\n* www.example.com/foo/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path. It can also simplify the number of purge calls made.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only) \n\nPurging by hostname is similar to purging by prefixes. Use a list of hostnames to purge the cache of any assets associated with those hostnames.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by tags (Enterprise only)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment-for-best-performance"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00720-2713-4113", "score": 0.6846466660499573, "text": "\nAlternatively, if you are using an SDK, [obtain an IAM API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) and set the client options by using environment variables.\n\nexport RESOURCE_CONTROLLER_APIKEY={iam_api_key}\n2.

For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored.

Check out [Purging keys in the console](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-delete-keysdelete-keys-gui-purge) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purging keys in the console \n\nIf it is important to your use case to purge a key sooner than 90 days (the soonest a key can be purged after a normal deletion), the key can be purged after four hours if a user [has the KeyPurge role](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-grant-access-keysgrant-access-keys-specific-functions).\n\nBecause a purged key has its key material permanently shredded and metadata inaccessible, a purged key cannot be restored. It is therefore even more important to ensure that the key has no vital associated resources.\n\nTo purge a key:\n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-delete-keys"}]}

The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift overview \n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform is a platform that is designed to orchestrate containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network.

Review the [common scenarios where you might need to modify your apps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-plan_deployopenshift_move_apps_scenarios) so that you can deploy them on Red Hat OpenShift clusters.\n\n\n\n Deploying apps through the console \n\nYou can create apps through various methods in the Red Hat OpenShift console by using the Developer perspective. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/applications/creating_applications/odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective.html).\n\n\n\n1. From the [Red Hat OpenShift clusters console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters?platformType=openshift), select your cluster.\n2. Click Red Hat OpenShift web console.\n3. From the perspective switcher, select Developer. The Red Hat OpenShift web console switches to the Developer perspective, and the menu now offers items such as +Add, Topology, and Builds.\n4. Click +Add.\n5. In the Add pane menu bar, select the Project that you want to create your app in from the drop-down list.\n6. Click the method that you want to use to add your app, and follow the instructions. For example, click From Git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deploying apps through the CLI", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-deploy_app"}]}

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there.

Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-faq"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14639-1516-2901", "score": 0.7619762420654297, "text": "\nEnsure that you do not have any NSX objects that are expanded into the secondary instance that you want to delete.\n3.

This connection allows a transit gateway to connect to overlay networks hosted on classic infrastructure resources.\n\nThis form of GRE tunnel is now deprecated, and we suggest using an unbound GRE tunnel instead. Unbound GRE tunnels provide the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The ability to receive classic network subnets from a classic connection.\n* The ability to communicate through other unbound GRE tunnels on the same transit gateway in the same availability zone.\n* Does not require a classic connection on the transit gateway. As a result, the classic network's subnets will not be advertised to the connections on the transit gateway (and vice versa).\n\n\n\nSee [Creating an Unbound Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel connection](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-unbound-gre-connection) for more information.\n\nMigrating your GRE tunnels to unbound GRE tunnels requires deleting any existing GRE tunnels before creating new unbound ones. Migration will also cause a network disruption for anything that uses the old GRE tunnel until you create the new one.\n\nTo migrate from a GRE tunnel to an unbound GRE tunnel:\n\n\n\n1. Gather the existing GRE tunnel's configuration information for use on the new unbound GRE tunnel.\n2.

How can I use my own keys to encrypt my data? \n\nSee [Securing your data in IBM Cloud Satellite](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-data-security).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I make my data secure over Satellite Link? \n\nYour Satellite location infrastructure is a part of your local network (on-prem hosts) or the network of your cloud provider, but is managed remotely by using secure Satellite Link access from IBM Cloud. All communication over Satellite Link is encrypted by IBM. When you create an endpoint, you can optionally specify an additional data encryption protocol for the endpoint connection between the client source and destination resource. For example, even if the traffic is not encrypted on the source side, you can specify your own additional TLS encryption for the connection that goes over the internet.\n\nTo review information about how Satellite Link handles each type of connection protocol, see [Encryption protocols](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-link-location-cloudlink-protocols). To review other frequently asked questions about Satellite Link network security, see [External network requirements and security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-link-location-cloudlink-security).\n\n\n\n\n\n What measures can I take to secure user access to data in my location? \n\nReview the

Packets can be accepted or dropped according to only basic access control list (ACL) criteria, such as the source and destination fields in the IP or Transmission Control Protocols/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) headers. A stateless Brocade 5400 vRouter does not store connection information and has no requirement to look up every packet's relation to previous flows, both of which consume small amounts of memory and CPU time. Therefore, raw forwarding performance is best on a stateless system.

Defining one or more sets of rules.\n2. Applying a set of rules to an interface or a zone. A zone consists of one or more network interfaces.\n\n\n\nIt is important to test firewall rules after creation to ensure the rules work as intended and that new rules do not restrict administrative access to the device.\n\nWhile manipulating rules on the dp0bond1 interface, it is advised to connect to the device using dp0bond0. Connecting to the console using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is also an option.\n\n\n\n Stateless vs stateful \n\nBy default, the firewall is stateless, but it can be configured as stateful if needed. A stateless firewall will need rules for traffic in both directions, while stateful firewalls track connections and automatically allow the returning traffic of accepted flows. To configure a stateful firewall, you must dictate which rules you want to operate statefully.\n\nTo enable 'stateful' tracking of tcp, udp, or icmp traffic, run the following commands:\n\nset security firewall global-state-policy icmp\nset security firewall global-state-policy tcp\nset security firewall global-state-policy udp\n\nNote that the global-state-policy commands will only track the state of traffic that has matched a firewall rule which explicitly sets the corresponding protocol. For example:\n\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATELESS rule 1 action accept\n\nAs GLOBAL_STATELESS does not specify protocol tcp, the global-state-policy tcp command would not apply on this rule.\n\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP rule 1 action accept\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP rule 1 protocol tcp\n\nIn this case protocol tcp is explicitly defined. The global-state-policy tcp command would enable stateful tracking of traffic that matches rule 1 of GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-manage-your-ibm-firewalls"}]}

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03411-4781-6488", "score": 0.6645881533622742, "text": "\nTo achieve the same goal, you can use a saved version as the basis for a new version in which you incorporate any changes you want to make.

For English, this includes a-z and A-Z. For other languages, valid characters can include accented letters or language-specific characters.\n* In English, substitute equivalent English letters for non-English or accented letters. For example, s for \u00e7, ny for \u00f1, or e for \u00e8.\n* Use real or made-up words that are pronounceable for words that are difficult to pronounce. For example, in English you can use the sounds-like shuchesnie for the word Sczcesny.\n* Use the spelling of numbers without dashes. For example, for the number 75, use seventy five in English, setenta y cinco in Spanish, and soixante quinze in French.\n* To pronounce a single letter, use the letter followed by a space. For example, use N C A A, notN. C. A. A., N.C.A.A., or NCAA.\n* You can include multiple words that are separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n* For most languages, the service enforces a maximum of 40 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces.\n* For Japanese, the service enforces a maximum limit of 25 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces.

The runtime component receives a collection of documents and runs the extractor on each document to extract information from that document.\n\nAn extractor consists of one or more AQL modules to create a collection of views that each defines a relation. Some of these views are designated as output views, while others are non-output views. Non-output views can include some views that are imported into or exported from a module. It is important to note that output views and exported views are orthogonal. For example, a view that is exported does not qualify as a view that is output. In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module. When two or more modules are combined to form an extractor, the duplicate-free union of Document schemas of all modules is the required Document view.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16471-106006-108222", "score": 0.6683732271194458, "text": "\nAll other spans are left untouched.\n* LeftToRight\n\nThis policy processes the spans in order from left to right.

This policy emulates the overlap-handling policy of most regular expression engines.\n\n\n\n* <priority_column>\n\nSpecifies a column of type Text, String, Integer, or Float. Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy.\n* <priority_order>\n\nSpecifies either ascending or descending order. Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy. The ascending order ensures that if a tuple T1 has priority 1 and a tuple T2 has priority 2, T1 has a higher priority than T2. By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical. All inputs with a null <consolidate target> result in a single output tuple, which is chosen randomly among those inputs. This behavior is similar to how tuples are consolidated with an identical span in the target column. The exception to resulting in a single output tuple is if the policy is ContainsButNotEqual. In that case, the null <consolidate target> outputs all inputs with null consolidate target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nExample 1: Consolidate on single column\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the field Person.name of all output tuples and to use the ContainedWithin consolidation policy to resolve overlap.\n\nconsolidate on Person.name\nusing 'ContainedWithin'\n\nExample 2: Consolidate on expression, involving multiple columns\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the result of applying the CombineSpans scalar function to fields Person.firstname and Person.lastname in each output tuple.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03268-5869-7269", "score": 0.6558870077133179, "text": "\nYou might want to define the customization in the welcome node or another node that is triggered early in the conversation so it is applied any time disambiguation is triggered.\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n]\n},\n\"context\": {\n\"smsAction\": {\n\"command\": \"smsActSetDisambiguationConfig\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"prefixText\": \"%s.\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\nWhen displayed, the assistant shows the introductory text that is configured for disambiguation, such as Did you mean?.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07321-0-2419", "score": 0.6784136891365051, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Securing your data in Direct Link \n\nDirect Link does not store any customer data.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb/vpc/images/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency.

By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15470-7-1659", "score": 0.7946130633354187, "text": "\nGetting started with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) \n\nWith IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you can use the UI, CLI, and API to quickly provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account.

It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02873-5855-7814", "score": 0.7119747996330261, "text": "\nSee [Conditional responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-builddialog-overview-multiple) for more information.\n* By configuring digression settings for dialog nodes.

Any dialog node with a node name (or external node name) can be shown as a suggestion, unless its Show node name setting is set to Off.\n\nTo customize suggestions, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03273-13172-14845", "score": 0.7076066732406616, "text": "\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match.

Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

So, you will add your own intent.\n\n\n\n Add the about_restaurant intent \n\n\n\n1.

The dialog flow is represented graphically in the tool as a tree. You can add a branch to process each of the intents that you want your assistant to handle.\n* Entities: An entity represents a term or object that provides context for an intent. For example, an entity might be a city name that helps your dialog to distinguish which store the user wants to know store hours for. After you add entities, update your dialog to use them. Add dialog nodes that handle the many possible permutations of a request based on the entities that are found in the user input.\n\n\n\nAs you add training data, a natural language classifier is automatically added to the skill.

Doing so helps to establish a relationship between the intent and entities. It is a weak relationship, but it does inform the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotated mentions \n\nAs you define entities, you can annotate mentions of the entity directly from your existing intent user examples. A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value. And when you add the mention to an existing entity value, it is also added to that entity value as new synonym. Intent classification does use these types of dictionary references in intent user examples to establish a weak reference between an intent and an entity.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"}]}

So thank you for watching this video, and happy block chaining.\n\n\n\n Creating your peer organization's CA \n\nYour CA issues the certificates and private keys for your organization's admins, client applications, and nodes. These identities are not managed by IBM and the private keys are not stored in the console. They are only stored in your browser local storage. Therefore, make sure to export your identities and the MSP of your organization. If you attempt to access the console from a different machine or a different browser, you will need to import these identities and organization definitions.\n\nTo create the CA that will issue certificates for your first organization, perform the following steps in your console:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Nodes tab on the left and click Add Certificate Authority. The side panels will allow you to customize the CA that you want to create and the organization that this CA will issue keys for.\n2. In this tutorial, we're creating nodes, as opposed to importing them, so make sure the option to Create a Certificate Authority is selected. Then click Next.\n3. Use the side panel to give your CA a display name. Our recommended value for this CA is Org1 CA. Then give your CA admin credentials by specifying a CA administrator enroll ID of admin and a secret of adminpw. Again, these are recommended values.\n4.

I\u2019ll be following the process from the IBM Blockchain platform documentation, which you can see here. At the end of this tutorial, you will have created this structure, representing the components related to org1. In our next video, we\u2019ll create an ordering service.

These are the same values you\u2019ll find in the docs, which are cataloged in tables for the various tasks. These values are not mandatory, but if you\u2019re using the console for the first time, we do recommended them. In cases where you have to reenter a value, for example an enroll ID and secret, which are not stored in the console, you will be able to refer to the tables in the documentation to remember what you entered. If you do choose different values, make sure to write them down somewhere.\n\nAlright, so let\u2019s get started creating that peer. If you're unfamiliar with Hyperledger Fabric, which the IBM Blockchain Platform is based on, you might not realize you have to create a Certificate Authority before you create a peer. This is because before we can create a peer, we have to create some identities. These identities allow a network entity, whether it\u2019s an admin or a node, to sign its actions using a certificate. Those certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, also known as a CA.

This tutorial will complete the structure you see here, with Org1, which we created in our first video, creating a channel run on our ordering service, which we created in our second video.\n\nIf you don't know what channels are, they're the place where transactions involving assets happen in the IBM Blockchain Platform. And because channels can be created with a subset of the members of a network, channels are also a powerful tool to enable privacy. Only the members of a channel will know about that channel and have access to its ledger, enabling the related business partners who form networks a space to execute deals that only they know about. Whatever the reason, the process for creating a channel is the same.\n\nSince we\u2019re creating a channel, you might be tempted to click over to the channels tab. But there's actually a step we need to do first, which is to add org1 to the consortium. Now what is the consortium? A consortium is the list of organizations that are allowed to create channels on a particular ordering service. Once an organization is added to this list, which is maintained by the admins of the ordering service, an organization will be able to create a channel. To do that, we must click into the Ordering Service and click Add Organization under the Consortium members header. Then we must select the org1msp, as this is our peer organization.

Building the conversation that your assistant has with your customers is fundamentally about deciding which steps, or which user interactions, are required to complete an action. After you identify the list of steps, you can then focus on writing engaging content to turn each interaction into a positive experience for your customer.\n\n![Diagram of a simple exchange between a customer and an actions skill step.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/action-skill-explained.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog skill", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03126-3707-6008", "score": 0.6741839647293091, "text": "\nUnderstanding where you will deploy the assistant before you begin can help you author the right types of answers for a given channel or platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n What languages does your assistant speak? \n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-4297-6315", "score": 0.662592351436615, "text": "\nThe dialog node response is equivalent to a Then statement in If-Then-Else programming logic. \n Skill Does the work of the assistant.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03218-11740-13217", "score": 0.7609685063362122, "text": "\n<-- </ul> --><-- </section \"id=\"section-dialog-runtime-disambig-choose-nodes\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-dialog-runtime-disambig-disable\" \"> --> Hiding nodes from disambiguation altogether You can prevent every node in a dialog or an individual dialog node from being included in the disambiguation list.<-- <ul> --> * To disable disambiguation entirely:\n<-- <ul> -->\n\n* From the Skills menu, click Options.\n* On the Disambiguation page, set the switch to Off.\n\n<-- </ul> -->\n\n* To prevent a single dialog node from being included in the disambiguation list:\n<-- <ul> -->\n\n* From the Skills menu, click Dialog.

Enter the full node ID into the search field. You might want to find the dialog node that is associated with a known node ID for any of the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* You are reviewing logs, and the log refers to a section of the dialog by its node ID.\n* You want to map the node IDs listed in the nodes_visited property of the API message output to nodes that you can see in your dialog tree.\n* A dialog runtime error message informs you about a syntax error, and uses a node ID to identify the node you need to fix.\n\n\n\nAnother way to discover a node based on its node ID is by following these steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the Dialog page, select any node in your dialog tree.\n2. Close the edit view if it is open for the current node.\n3. In your web browser's location field, a URL should display that has syntax similar to the following:\n\nhttps://{location}.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/{location}/{instance-id}/skills/{skill-id}/build/dialognode={node-id}\n4.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response. Changing one line of text can prevent you from having to write multiple lines of code to implement a complex programmatic solution.\n* Back up your skill frequently.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application.

For example, you might be creating an application that gains insights from medical records. To build the type system, you start looking at patient records to see what kinds of information must be captured. The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-5954-7906", "score": 0.7209548354148865, "text": "\nYou can add these to your skill and start using them immediately.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

Cloud Functions serverless architecture reduces the constraint on the granularity of your microservices architecture.\n\nWhen not in use, Cloud Functions costs nothing. Your code runs only when a specific action occurs, such as an HTTP call, database state change, or other type of event that triggers the execution of your code. You get billed by millisecond of execution time rounded up to the nearest 100 MS, not per hour of VM utilization regardless of whether that VM was doing useful work. Because you pay only when events are consumed and not based on the number of environments, you can break down your app into 100, 1000, or even more microservices.\n\n\n\n\n\n Run actions in any region \n\nIn traditional architectures, code must be running in each region to be executed there and the infrastructure for that region must also be paid for. With Cloud Functions, actions can be deployed and made available to run in any region at no extra cost.

Similar to other use cases, all considerations for scalability, and other Qualities of Services apply.\n\nSee the following example that includes a discussion of [using Serverless as an API backend](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.htmlACoupleOfExamples).\n\n\n\n\n\n Mobile back end \n\nMany mobile applications require server-side logic. However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills. Since mobile applications often have unpredictable load patterns, you want to use a Cloud Functions solution like IBM Cloud\u00ae. This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications.

Here are some approaches you can use to address common goals.\n\n\n\n* Returning the user's input: You can capture the exact text uttered by the user and return it in your response. Use the following SpEL expression in a response to repeat the text that the user specified back in the response:\n\nYou said: <? input.text ?>.\n\nIf autocorrection is on, and you want to return the user's original input before it was corrected, you can use <? input.original_text ?>. But, be sure to use a response condition that checks whether the original_text field exists first.\n* Determining the number of words in user input: You can perform any of the supported String methods on the input.text object. For example, you can find out how many words there are in a user utterance by using the following SpEL expression:\n\ninput.text.split(' ').size()\n\nSee [Expression language methods for String](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methodsdialog-methods-strings) to learn about more methods you can use.\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks. I want to open a savings account and apply for a credit card. How does the dialog recognize and address both of them?

For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.\n\n![Screen capture of the field in the node edit view where you add the node purpose summary.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/disambig-node-purpose.png)\n\nEvery dialog branch can be processed by the assistant while it chats with a customer, including branches with root nodes in folders.\n4. If a child node in any dialog branch conditions on a request or question that you do not want the assistant to handle, add a Connect to human agent response type to the child node.\n\nAt run time, if the conversation reaches this child node, the dialog is passed to a human agent at that point.\n\n\n\nYour dialog is now ready to support transfers from your assistant to a service desk agent.\n\nFor more information about different service desk solutions, see the following resources:\n\n\n\n* [Adding service desk support to the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-haa)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02998-8791-9815", "score": 0.7394676804542542, "text": "\nYou created a simple conversation with two intents and a dialog to recognize them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\nThis tutorial is built around a simple example.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03329-3417-4930", "score": 0.7184298634529114, "text": "\nYou successfully started to build your training data by adding prebuilt content from IBM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Build a dialog \n\nA [dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more.

It provides simplified provisioning, orchestrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC), templates, and managing IBM Cloud resources in your IBM Cloud environment by using various resources tools such as Terraform, Helm.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-workspace-continuous-deployment"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12098-7-1814", "score": 0.781047523021698, "text": "\nSoftware deployment in IBM Cloud Schematics \n\nTry out one of the IBM\u00ae provided software templates to quickly spin up a classic Virtual Server Instance (VSI), and automatically configure the instance to connect to an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for PostgreSQL instance.\n\nWith IBM Cloud Schematics, you can choose from a wide variety of [software and infrastructure templates](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalogsoftware) that you can use to set up IBM Cloud services, and to install IBM and Third party software. The templates are applied by using the built-in Terraform, Ansible, Helm, CloudPak, and Operator capabilities in Schematics.\n\nAs part of this getting started tutorial, you create a Schematics Workspaces that points to the [VSI database](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalogabout) template. Then, you run this template and watch Schematics provision your VSI and your IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL instance. IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL is a fully managed database offering in IBM Cloud that supports storing of non-relational and relational data types. For more information about this offering, see [What is PostgreSQL?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/databases-for-postgresql).\n\nThis getting started tutorial incurs costs. You must have an [IBM Cloud Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) account to proceed. Make sure that you review pricing information for [classic VSIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/gen1/infrastructure/provision/vs) and [PostgreSQL](https://cloud.ibm.com/databases/databases-for-postgresql/create).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you can use this template, you must complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Make sure that you have the permissions to [create classic virtual servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-get-started-software"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12095-7-2147", "score": 0.7796935439109802, "text": "\nGeneral \n\nAnswers to common questions about the IBM Cloud Schematics are classified into following section.\n\n\n\n What is IBM Cloud Schematics and how does it work? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics provides powerful tools to automate your cloud infrastructure provisioning and management process, the configuration and operation of your cloud resources, and the deployment of your app workloads.\n\nTo do so, Schematics uses open source projects, such as Terraform, Ansible, Red Hat OpenShift, Operators, and Helm, and delivers these capabilities to you as a managed service. Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

The project UI and API services are managed microservices, which are deployed to a minimum of three multi-zone regions around the world. A single zone failure results in service instances in other zones that are in the same region taking over. A regional failure results in another region taking over. Project microservices use IBM managed instances of Continuous Delivery Toolchains in at least three regions to run multi-step validation, deployments, and destroy resource jobs.\n\nProjects create instances of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces in your account and uses them to perform plan, deploy, and destory resource jobs. This ensures that Terraform state storage and any access to private resources is completely under customer control. The Schematics workspace UI, API, and CLI can be used, if needed, to provide additional control and visibility over how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is managed by projects.\n\nDeleting a Schematics workspace that's used by a project can cause the loss of the Terraform state for that configuration, which can lead to unexpected behavior for project users, for example, causing the project to create duplicate resources on the next deployment. Project-created Schematics workspaces are tagged with the related projects and configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n Project data storage \n\nProjects are a multi-tenant service that uses a regional data storage model where the data is stored in the region that is selected for the project. Specifically, project configuration data (the deployable architecture reference and selected inputs) is stored in a multi-tenant IBM managed IBM Cloudant database in the project region. The Schematics instances that are created in the customer account for a project are also located in the project region. This ensures that all configuration data is stored in the customer selected region.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.706352174282074, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6511023044586182, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04175-0-1274", "score": 0.7018717527389526, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com. This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-ibm-cis-for-optimal-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04170-1738-2974", "score": 0.6723490357398987, "text": "\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13429-102092-103862", "score": 0.7208088040351868, "text": "\nIf you have custom language or custom acoustic models that are based on the model, you must upgrade your existing custom models to take advantage of the updates by using the following methods:\n\n\n\n* POST /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/upgrade_model\n* POST /v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/upgrade_model\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Upgrading custom models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-custom-upgrade).\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 May 2019 \n\nUpdates to Spanish models for improved speech recognition\n: The Spanish language models have been updated for improved speech recognition:\n\n\n\n* es-ES_BroadbandModel\n* es-ES_NarrowbandModel\n\n\n\nBy default, the service automatically uses the updated models for all speech recognition requests.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "score": 0.6670488715171814, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "score": 0.6610472202301025, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry. Then, [install the open source Portieris project](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) admission controller to block container deployments from unsigned images.\n3. Regularly scan running containers:. Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01494-53476-54986", "score": 0.8125085830688477, "text": "\n* [Access roles for configuring Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamaccess_roles_configure)\n* [Access roles for using Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamaccess_roles_using)\n\n\n\n* [Assigning access to Container Registry in the console](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamregistry_iam_assign-access-console)\n* [Assigning access to Container Registry in the CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamregistry_iam_assign-access-cli)\n* [Assigning access to Container Registry by using the API](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamregistry_iam_assign-access-api)\n* [Assigning access to Container Registry by using Terraform](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamregistry_iam_assign-access-terraform)\n\n\n\n[Defining IAM access policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-useruser)\n\n\n\n* [Creating policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-usercreate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\n[Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_index)\n\n\n\n* [About Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexabout)\n\n\n\n* [Data protection](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexabout_data_protection)\n\n\n\n* [Types of vulnerabilities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indextypes)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-sitemap"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-71418-73421", "score": 0.8124859929084778, "text": "\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry provides a multi-tenant private image registry that you can use to store and share your container images with users in your IBM Cloud account.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-06-02\n\n\n\n[Encrypting images for content confidentiality](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_encrypt)Encrypting images for content confidentiality\n\nYou can protect the confidentiality of your IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry images, and ensure that hosts that aren't trusted can't run the images.\n\nKey Protect Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-01-25\n\n\n\n[Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iam_access)Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out how to grant access to your resources by configuring IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM) for IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.\n\nContainer Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-01-31\n\n\n\n[Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_tutorial_workflow)Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out about the basic functions of both IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-06-19\n\n\n\n[Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-opbundle-tutorial)Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry\n\nThis tutorial walks you through how to onboard a sample Operator bundle from a Red Hat\u00ae registry to your account.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret.

But when it comes to enterprise workloads, use a private registry, such as the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users.

Next, you can update the worker nodes up to two version ahead, such as 1.18 to 1.20 (n+2).\n\nIf your cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version, follow the [version archive instructions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsk8s_version_archive).

By using industry-standard containers technology, apps can initially be re-hosted on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service quickly without major architectural changes. This change provides the immediate benefit of scalability.\n\nThey can replicate and scale the apps by using defined rules and the automated Kubernetes orchestrator. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides scalable compute resources and the associated DevOps dashboards to create, scale, and tear down apps and services. By using Kubernetes's deployment and runtime objects, the provider can monitor and manage upgrades to apps reliably.\n\nIBM\u00ae Secure Gateway for IBM Cloud\u00ae is used to create a secure pipeline to on-premises databases and documents for apps that are re-hosted to run in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a modern NoSQL database suitable a range of data-driven use cases from key-value to complex document-oriented data storage and query. To minimize queries to the back-office RDBMS, IBM Cloudant is used to cache the user's session data across apps. These choices improve the front-end app usability and performance across the apps on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nMoving compute workloads into the IBM Cloud isn't enough though.

The Heapster pod discovers all nodes in the cluster and queries usage information from each node's kubelet. You can find utilization graphs in the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nIngress ALB\n: Ingress is a Kubernetes service that you can use to balance network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to multiple apps in your cluster. To expose your apps over the public or private network, you must create an Ingress resource to register your apps with the Ingress application load balancer (ALB). Multiple apps can then be accessed by using a single URL or IP address.\n\nStorage provider\n: Every cluster is set up with a plug-in to provision file storage.

For more information about deployments, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).\n\nPod\n: Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. Usually, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address.

Instead, use [Kubernetes secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-securitypi), such as an image pull secret for registry credentials. You can then reference these secrets in your deployment YAML file.\n\nSecret encryption\n: You can encrypt the Kubernetes secrets that you create in your cluster by using a key management service (KMS) provider.

To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16321-20604-22275", "score": 0.6598330736160278, "text": "\n\"message\": \"Sorry, I could not find an agent.\"\n},\n\"message_to_human_agent\": \"The caller needs help resetting their password\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Transferring upon failure \n\nTo configure transfer on failures, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings.

If User-to-User is specified in the transfer_headers list, the session history key is sent in the X-Watson-Assistant-Session-History-Key header.\n\nThe value of the SIP header is limited to 1024 bytes.\n\nHow this data is presented in the SIP REFER message also depends on the value of transfer_headers_send_method(as defined in [Generic Service Desk SIP Parameters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsgeneric-service-desk-sip-parameters)).\n\nThe following example shows the data included as headers:\n\nREFER sip:b@atlanta.example.com SIP/2.0\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP agenta.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK2293940223\nTo: <sip:b@atlanta.example.com>\nFrom: <sip:a@atlanta.example.com>;tag=193402342\nCall-ID: 898234234@agenta.atlanta.example.com\nCSeq: 23 REFER\nMax-Forwards: 7\nRefer-To: sip:user@domain.com", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16250-5445-7809", "score": 0.6582184433937073, "text": "\nTo support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06004-15614-17542", "score": 0.6582822799682617, "text": "\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step.

You see an error message similar to the following example:\n\nThe requested action can't be completed because the secret version is locked.\n\nIf you're working with\n\ndynamic secrets, such as IAM credentials, locking your secrets also means that by default, those secrets can't be read or accessed.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secret-locks"}]}

When it comes to managing API keys, you want the ability to create your credentials dynamically so that they exist only when you need them to. You also want to lease an API key to someone else on your team and ensure that it is automatically revoked after a time duration that you specify.\n\nWith Secrets Manager, you can create a\n\ndynamic secretthat you can use to access a protected resource, such as deployment logs that you store in a Cloud Object Storage bucket.

You send a request to create IAM credentials in Secrets Manager.\n2. Secrets Manager creates the secret and validates it against your defined IAM access policies.\n3. Later, a developer wants to access the contents of your storage bucket. The developer sends a request to retrieve the value of your IAM credential.\n4. Secrets Manager validates the request and generates a single-use API key that the developer can use to authenticate to Cloud Object Storage.

Given this common terminology, you can create dictionaries to help you categorize and filter the data.

You can think of annotations as tags that you add to words or phrases, where the tag categorizes or identifies the meaning of the word or phrase. The resulting annotations function as new facets that you can use to filter and dissect your data further.\n\nWith your new component and phenomenon facets, for example, you can look for correlations between components and phenomena that are involved in traffic incidents.\n\n[Learn about the ways that you can analyze your data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-cm-analyze-data).\n\n\n\n\n\n Digging deeper \n\nTo dig even deeper into your data, apply or create AI models that can find different types of information in your documents.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

Simple tier pricing table\n\n Quantity of Items Unit Price for All Items \n\n Tier 1: 1 - 1000 $1 USD \n Tier 2: 1001 - 2000 $0.90 USD \n Tier 3: 2001 - 3000 $0.75 USD \n Tier 4: 3001 - 4000 $0.60 USD \n Tier 5: > 4000 $0.40 USD \n\n\n\nThe following table illustrates how much you pay with a plan that is based on a simple tier pricing model:\n\n\n\nTable 3. Charge calculation by using the simple tier pricing model\n\n Quantity of Items Charge Calculation Total Price \n\n 500 500 \u00d7 1 = 500 $500 USD \n 1500 1500 \u00d7 0.90 = 1350 $1350 USD \n 2500 2500 \u00d7 0.75 = 1875 $1875 USD \n ... ... ... \n 5200 5200 \u00d7 0.40 = 2080 $2080 USD \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Graduated tier \n\nIn the graduated tier model, the unit price per tier decreases as your level of usage increases. The total price is the cumulative charges for each level of usage, consisting of your quantity multiplied by the unit price at that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 4. Graduated tier pricing table\n\n Quantity of Items Unit Price for Items in the Tier \n\n Tier 1: 1 - 1000 $1 USD \n Tier 2: 1001 - 2000 $0.90 USD \n Tier 3: 2001 - 3000 $0.75 USD \n Tier 4: 3001 - 4000 $0.60 USD \n Tier 5: > 4000 $0.40 USD \n\n\n\nThe following table illustrates how much you pay with a plan that is based on a graduated tier pricing model:\n\n\n\nTable 5.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption.

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01705-7074-9036", "score": 0.6641102433204651, "text": "\nAlso, with a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can order Advanced or Premium support plans to get extra help with your production workloads.

For more information, see [Enterprise Savings Plan billing model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-committed-use).\n\n\n\n\n\n Subscription account \n\nSubscription accounts offer many of the same benefits as Pay-As-You-Go accounts, including access to the full IBM Cloud catalog and the ability to create multiple resource groups. In addition, Subscription accounts provide discounts for platform services and support and more consistent billing through subscriptions. You can also [set up spending notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending) to get notified when your account or a particular service reaches a specific spending threshold that you set.\n\nWhen you purchase a subscription, you commit to a minimum spending amount for a certain period of time and receive a discount on the overall cost. For example, if you commit to spend $1,000 a month for 6 months, you might get a 5% discount. For the duration of the subscription, you get $6,000 of usage but pay only $5,700 for it. The larger the subscription, the better the discount.\n\nLarge organizations and other users with large cloud workloads can benefit from the savings and predictable billing that are provided by subscriptions. IBM Cloud offers multiple types of subscriptions to fit your usage needs.\n\nA subset of subscription accounts are eligible for the new Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-1068047-1069909", "score": 0.6620926856994629, "text": "\nIf you manage your invoices through the IBM Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking Manage > Billing and usage, and selecting Invoices.

When you are confident on the feature that you want to roll out is working as intended, increase the percentage over time.\n\nPercentage rollout uses a hashing algorithm that generates a hash based on the rule set. This hash is used by the SDK to generate a percentage value for that user. The percentage value generated for that user is compared to the value set for the percentage rollout value, determines whether the user is eligible to receive that feature or not.\n\nFor example, the hash has partitions from 1 to 100,000. When you assign a feature flag, the hash assigns values from 1 to 100,000 to users in each partition. For example, when you assign 25% to a feature flag, App Configuration SDK delivers that feature to hash partitions from 1 to 25,000. If you change the percentage of users receiving that feature from 25% to 50%, partitions 25,001 to 50,000 would be added to the set of partitions already receiving that feature.\n\nPercentage rollout capability is available for Lite and Enterprise plans.\n\nFollowing are some of the percentage rollout scenarios:\n\n\n\n* If the feature flag is disabled, then SDK returns the default Disabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rules and no percentage rollout is set, then the SDK returns default Enabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rule and percentage rollout is set to 0%, then the SDK returns Disabled value for all users.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-feature-flags"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02680-9660-11121", "score": 0.6533474326133728, "text": "\n@Override\npublic void onConfigurationUpdate() {\n// ADD YOUR CODE\n}\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples for using property and feature-related APIs for Android apps written in Java \n\nRefer to the examples for using the property and feature-related APIs.\n\n\n\n* Get single feature\n\nFeature feature = appConfiguration.getFeature(\"featureId\");\n* Get all features\n\nHashMap<String,Feature> features = appConfiguration.getFeatures();\n* Feature evaluation\n\nYou can use the feature.getCurrentValue() method to evaluate the value of the feature flag.
