related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-1160-2754","score":0.7192420363,"text":"\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/depmodels\/cloud\/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/training\/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/35-Connectivity.svg)](https:\/\/community.ibm.com\/community\/user\/publiccloud\/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06501-7-1686","score":0.7148670554,"text":"\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way. It has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database.

You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together.

You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant. We could decide to add the \"address\" object only to the following documents:\n\n\n\n* Documents that are created from now on.\n* Only documents that we have addresses for.\n\n\n\nIn other words, documents of the same type can have fields present or missing.\n\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs.

In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier. You must definitely avoid patterns that rely on updating the same document over and over in a small time window.\n\n\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07046-10420-12297","score":0.7399469018,"text":"\nFor more information, see [How fields are handled](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-index-overviewfield-name-limits).\n* If a root-level field is an array but contains no items, the field is omitted from the index.\n* If a root-level field is an array and contains only one item, the array is indexed as the data type of the one item. For example, a string array with one string is indexed as a string.\n* If a nested field contains an array, even if the array has only one value, it is indexed as an array.\n* If a root-level field is an array and contains more than one item, the data is indexed as an array.\n* If you copy JSON that is generated by Discovery and then upload it as a JSON file, remove these system-generated fields from the file first: document_id, parent_document_id, filename, and title.\n* You cannot enable the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature for JSON files.\n* If your source document has a field with the name document_id, the field is skipped and not added to the index in the collection.\n\nHow the document_id field in a JSON file is handled changed with the 2023-03-31 version update of the API. Before the update, when you uploaded a JSON file from the product user interface or used the API to add it with the Add document method, the value in the document_id field from the file was shown as the document_id value in query results. However, a different document ID was assigned to it and stored in the parent_document_id field. The assigned document ID is what was returned when you called the List documents method and is what had to be used as the document_id in the endpoint URL for a Delete document method request. When you used the Update document method to assign a new document_id, the original ID continued to be returned in query results.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Its bigger brother, the Standard Plan, is a paid-for service where you specify the number of reads, writes, and queries per second for your application and that capacity is reserved for you. You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00510-7123-9213","score":0.7867455482,"text":"\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB.

IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00510-7123-9213","score":0.784262836,"text":"\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API. For more information about the phrase operator of the query API, see [Query operators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-operatorsphrase).\n\n\n\n\n\n A short query returns irrelevant results \n\nIt might be that your query contains too many stop words and not enough distinct terms to trigger a meaningful search. When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13475-2776-3323","score":0.6920647621,"text":"\n* [IBM Cloud Data Engine introduction](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-videovideo_samples_notebooks_api).\n* [How to connect to IBM Cloud Object Storage through the Command Line](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-videovideo_command_line).\n* [How to use the Data Engine REST API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-videovideo_rest_api).\n* [How to operationalize SQL code and call it from an application](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-videovideo_samples_notebooks_api).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting-started"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00491-6023-7483","score":0.6909290552,"text":"\n\"bookmark\": \"g1AAAABweJzLYWBgYMpgSmHgKy5JLCrJTq2MT8lPzkzJBYorpBiYGJolWaSZmaWYpFqmGBiYmKclphhappqZmRglG5uD9HHA9BGlIwsAms8eJw\",\n\"warning\": \"No matching index found, create an index to optimize query time.\"\n}\n\n\n\nNext, you find a document in the database by using multiple operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Running a query with operators \n\nIn this example, the $gt (greater than) and $eq (equal) operators are used to search for documents that include a temperature that is greater than 20 degrees and a description that contains the value hot.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API. For more information about the phrase operator of the query API, see [Query operators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-operatorsphrase).\n\n\n\n\n\n A short query returns irrelevant results \n\nIt might be that your query contains too many stop words and not enough distinct terms to trigger a meaningful search. When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions. A common table expression permits defining a result table with a table name that can be specified as a table name in any FROM clause of the fullselect that follows.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09989-0-1547","score":0.7315990329,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Query editor \n\nWith the query editor, you can run SQL queries on a specific host and database.

For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13498-7-2240","score":0.7607048154,"text":"\nSQL reference \n\n\n\n Introduction \n\nWith IBM Cloud\u00ae Data Engine, you can analyze and transform open data with SQL. It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions. A common table expression permits defining a result table with a table name that can be specified as a table name in any FROM clause of the fullselect that follows.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.25,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.1175161048}}

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match.

For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time.

Thus, each annotator receives 14 documents to annotate (6+8).\n\n\n\nAn annotation set that you plan to use to train a machine learning model must contain at least 10 annotated documents.\n\n\n\n1. Select a user name from the list of human annotators.\n2. Name the annotation set.\n\nAs a good practice for evaluating a human annotator's work as the workspace progresses, you might want to create annotation set names that identify the human annotator assigned to the set.\n\nYou cannot change the annotation set name after the set is created.\n3. Click Generate.\n\n\n\n6. A list of available annotation sets is displayed under Available Sets, along with the names of the human annotators assigned to them. To add available sets to your annotation task, click Add to task.\n7. Make sure that all of the annotation sets that you want to include in the task appear under Selected Sets, then click Save to create the task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What to do next \n\nAfter the task is created, you can return to the Annotation Tasks tab on the Machine Learning Model > Annotations page to view the progress of each human annotator. Also, you can complete the following tasks:\n\n\n\n* Check approved documents that overlap between annotation sets to resolve annotation conflicts.\n* Open a task to add annotation sets to it. Ensure that the annotation sets that you add include documents that overlap with documents in the original annotation sets.\n\n\n\nFrom the Settings tab of the main navigation, you can specify the following information:\n\n\n\n* Specify preferences for using colors and keyboard shortcuts in the ground truth editor.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16417-1764-4158","score":0.7721025944,"text":"\nAs the project manager resolves annotation conflicts, the approved annotations are promoted to ground truth.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that human annotation always requires judgment calls.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed.

Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds. The level of precision is not restricted, so you can specify values such as 0.25 and 0.125. The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request.

The service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events. If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

If only you could find it!\n\nGive your assistant access to this information by adding a search skill to your assistant. The search skill uses Discovery to return smart answers to natural language questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand your assistant's responsibilities \n\nIf you start small, and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03126-5596-6966","score":0.7175492644,"text":"\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

This behavior was changed and you don't need to make that selection when you change the region or zone.\n* You can now delete the virtual server instance without manually unbinding the floating IP address. When you delete the virtual server instance, the floating IP address is now automatically unbound before the virtual server instance is deleted.

Object Storage stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations.\n\nBy default, all objects that are stored in Object Storage are encrypted by using randomly generated keys and an all-or-nothing-transform (AONT).

In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and IBM Cloud service on the private backbone. VPE for VPC gives you the experience of controlling all the private addressing within your cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Variation with edge\/transit VPC for public internet access \n\nYou might want to allow consumers to access your service through the public internet.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time.

It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02873-7-1949","score":0.7369235754,"text":"\nDialog overview \n\nThe dialog uses the intents that are identified in the user's input, plus context from the application, to interact with the user and ultimately provide a useful response.\n\nThe dialog matches intents (what users say) to responses (what the bot says back).

See [Digressions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-digressions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding responses \n\n\n\n* Keep answers short and useful.\n* Reflect the user's intent in the response.\n\nDoing so assures users that the bot is understanding them, or if it is not, gives users a chance to correct a misunderstanding.\n* Only include links to external sites in responses if the answer depends on data that changes frequently.\n* Avoid overusing buttons. Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response. Changing one line of text can prevent you from having to write multiple lines of code to implement a complex programmatic solution.\n* Back up your skill frequently.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02998-8791-9815","score":0.7472327948,"text":"\nYou created a simple conversation with two intents and a dialog to recognize them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\nThis tutorial is built around a simple example.

The response might be the answer to a question such as Where can I get some gas? or the execution of a command, such as turning on the radio. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree. Create a branch to process each intent that you want your conversation to handle.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02882-7-2075","score":0.7375108004,"text":"\nBuilding a conversational flow \n\nThe dialog defines what your assistant says in response to customers.\n\n\n\n Creating a dialog \n\nTo create a dialog, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The response might be the answer to a question such as Where can I get some gas? or the execution of a command, such as turning on the radio. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree.

The response might be the answer to a question such as Where can I get some gas? or the execution of a command, such as turning on the radio. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree. Create a branch to process each intent that you want your conversation to handle. A branch is composed of multiple nodes.\n\n\n\n Dialog nodes \n\nEach dialog node contains, at a minimum, a condition and a response.\n\n![Shows user input going to a box that contains the statement If: CONDITION, Then: RESPONSE](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/node1-empty.png)\n\n\n\n* Condition: Specifies the information that must be present in the user input for this node in the dialog to be triggered.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02882-7-2075","score":0.7567709684,"text":"\nBuilding a conversational flow \n\nThe dialog defines what your assistant says in response to customers.\n\n\n\n Creating a dialog \n\nTo create a dialog, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

For example, an entity might represent a city where the user wants to find a business location, or the amount of a bill payment. The name of an entity is always prefixed with the @ character.\n\nYou can train the skill to recognize your entities by providing entity term values and synonyms, entity patterns, or by identifying the context in which an entity is typically used in a sentence.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02841-1435-2454","score":0.7461240888,"text":"\n[A sample dialog tree with example content](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/dialog-depiction.png) \n\n\n\nThe dialog skill itself is defined in text, but you can integrate it with Watson Speech to Text and Watson Text to Speech services that enable users to interact with your assistant verbally.\n\n![Out-of-the-box training data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/oob.png) If you want to get started quickly, add prebuilt training data to your dialog skill so your assistant can start helping your customers with the basics.\n\n\n\n\n\n Search skill \n\nA search skill leverages information from existing corporate knowledge bases or other collections of content authored by subject matter experts to address unanticipated or more nuanced customer inquiries.\n\nSee [Creating assistants](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-add) to get started.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistants"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02961-7-1871","score":0.7460379601,"text":"\nDialog building tips \n\nGet tips about ways to address common tasks.\n\n\n\n Adding nodes \n\n\n\n* Add a node name that describes the purpose of the node.\n\nYou currently know what the node does, but months from now you might not.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response.

Click the Dialog tab, and then click Create dialog.\n\nWhen you open the dialog editor for the first time, the following nodes are created for you:\n\n\n\n* Welcome: The first node. It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs that are deployed in environments such as messaging channels where customers start the conversation do not process nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\n2.

Recently, you might have heard about Heroku changing their policy on free - the free tier. It's causing a challenge for a lot of developers out there so I want to take a handful of moments here to show you how you can migrate from Heroku to Code Engine from IBM Cloud in just a handful of steps. So let's go ahead and start playing around with it and see how quickly you can actually make your system work.\n\nSo first thing first, if you haven't seen it this is the actual line inside the official blog from Heroku, starting on November 28, 2022, we plan to stop free - offering the free product plans and plan on shutting down the free dynos and data services. We'll be sending out a series of email communications to affected users. This is challenging for a lot of beginner beginner web applications. I know for a fact personally I used Heroku when I first started back in the day so this is a pretty large hit for a lot of people and I want to show you how easy it is to convert from Heroku to Code Engine.\n\nSo first thing first, let's actually see a nice little application I've created. If I go ahead and bring up my application here, we have a nice little flask app. If you don't know what python is or flask is, it's a it's a format for python to be able to run an application on a standard port. So let's say we have this application; it says \u201cHello World!\u201d. I've already deployed it and we can check out right here We have our amazing production app at heroku.com. It says \u201chello world\u201d and we want to go ahead and change it. We wanted to update it so I'm going to go ahead and quickly update it to \u201cHello Moving from Heroku to Code Engine\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and come out of it. git add .git commit -m \u201cupdate hello line\u201d.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05412-4112-4628","score":0.6943808794,"text":"\n7.

It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-index"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07080-6045-7467","score":0.6899365187,"text":"\n[checkbox](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8\/discovery-data\/images\/checkbox.png) Deploy your solution.

If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant uses industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom-built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search integration with IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\nZoom\n\n![Flow diagram of the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718\/watson-assistant\/images\/arch-detail.png)\n\nHow it works\n\nCustomers interact with the assistant through one or more of these channels:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16270-0-505","score":0.7357872128,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Browser support \n\nThe Watson Assistant application requires the same level of browser software as is required by IBM Cloud.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03329-3417-4930","score":0.7184298635,"text":"\nYou successfully started to build your training data by adding prebuilt content from IBM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Build a dialog \n\nA [dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree.

For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.\n\n![Screen capture of the field in the node edit view where you add the node purpose summary.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/disambig-node-purpose.png)\n\nEvery dialog branch can be processed by the assistant while it chats with a customer, including branches with root nodes in folders.\n4. If a child node in any dialog branch conditions on a request or question that you do not want the assistant to handle, add a Connect to human agent response type to the child node.\n\nAt run time, if the conversation reaches this child node, the dialog is passed to a human agent at that point.\n\n\n\nYour dialog is now ready to support transfers from your assistant to a service desk agent.\n\nFor more information about different service desk solutions, see the following resources:\n\n\n\n* [Adding service desk support to the web chat](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-haa)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02961-7-1871","score":0.7362893224,"text":"\nDialog building tips \n\nGet tips about ways to address common tasks.\n\n\n\n Adding nodes \n\n\n\n* Add a node name that describes the purpose of the node.\n\nYou currently know what the node does, but months from now you might not.

The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant. For example, you might direct customers to your call center phone number or to an online support ticket form URL.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02998-8791-9815","score":0.7207003832,"text":"\nYou created a simple conversation with two intents and a dialog to recognize them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\nThis tutorial is built around a simple example.

However, the underlying hardware is shared with other IBM customers. For more information, see [Virtual machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm). You manage the worker nodes through the automation tools that are provided by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, such as the API, CLI, or console.

Community Kubernetes worker nodes run on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64, 16.04 x86_64 (deprecated). \n Cluster networking Your worker nodes are created in a VPC subnet in the zone that you specify. By default, the public and private cloud service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPC VPN on the private network. \n App networking You can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes.

Additionally, you can specify a custom subnet CIDR for pods and services by using the --pod-subnet and --service-subnet options in the ibmcloud ks cluster create command when you create your cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication \n\nWhen you create the cluster, you enable private cloud service endpoint only to allow worker-to-master and user-to-master communication over the private network. Cluster users must either be in your VPC network or connect through a [VPC VPN connection](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-vpc-vpnaas).\n\n\n\n\n\n Worker communication to other services or networks \n\nTo connect your cluster with your on-premises data center, you can set up the VPC VPN service. The IBM Cloud VPC VPN connects your entire VPC to an on-premises data center. If your app workload requires other IBM Cloud services that support private cloud service endpoints, your worker nodes can automatically, securely communicate with these services over the private VPC network.\n\n\n\n\n\n External communication to apps that run on worker nodes \n\nAfter you test your app, you can expose it to the private network by creating a private Kubernetes LoadBalancer service or using the default private Ingress application load balancers (ALBs). The VPC load balancer that is automatically created in your VPC outside of your cluster when you use one of these services routes traffic to your app.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05713-118454-119914","score":0.732839644,"text":"\n* [Communication with resources in other VPCs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-other-vpcs)\n* [Communication with IBM Cloud classic resources](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-classic)\n\n\n\n* [External communication to apps that run on worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-external-workers)\n* [Private traffic to cluster apps](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-apps-private)\n* [Public traffic to cluster apps](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-apps-public)\n* [Example scenarios for VPC cluster network setups](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-scenarios)\n\n\n\n* [Scenario: Run internet-facing app workloads in a VPC cluster](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-no-pgw)\n* [Worker-to-worker communication](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-no-pgw-worker)\n* [Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-no-pgw-master)\n* [Worker communication to other services or networks](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-no-pgw-services)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05713-117442-118921","score":0.7297625542,"text":"\n* [Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication using Virtual private endpoints or cloud service endpoints](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-workeruser-master)\n* [Worker-to-master communication in VPC clusters](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsworker-to-master-comms)\n* [User-to-master communication in VPC clusters](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsuser-to-master-comms)\n* [Worker communication to other services or networks](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem)\n* [Communication with other IBM Cloud services over the private or public network](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-cloud-service)\n* [Communication with resources in on-premises data centers](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-resources)\n\n\n\n* [Communication with resources in other VPCs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-other-vpcs)\n* [Communication with IBM Cloud classic resources](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem-classic)\n\n\n\n* [External communication to apps that run on worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-external-workers)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05640-12537-14489","score":0.7284591198,"text":"\nUnable to create or delete worker nodes due to endpoints error \n\n What\u2019s happening \n\nYou can't manage worker nodes for your cluster, and you receive an error message similar to one of the following.\n\nWorker deploy failed due to network communications failing to master or registry endpoints.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test?

Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.7063521743,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.6511023045,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04175-0-1274","score":0.6444553733,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07223-4208-5090","score":0.657746315,"text":"\n* [View the Demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uigisF50F8s&feature=youtu.be)\n\n\n\n[Cognitive Banking Chatbot](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/patterns\/create-cognitive-banking-chatbot\/?cm_sp=Developer-_-code-_-banking_chatbot) Create a web UI chatbot using the IBM Watson Node.js SDK to include conversation interaction, anger detection, natural language understanding, and answer discovery.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with \/cdn-cgi\/challenge-platform\/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action. Enter (cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed) into the Expression preview section as a singular rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations \n\n\n\n* If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n\n\n\n* Ensure that anything under \/cdn-cgi\/challenge-platform\/ is allowed.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-javascript-detections"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2890648263}}

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-175663-177618","score":0.6817176938,"text":"\n* A larger editing view makes it easier to view all the details of a node as you work on it.\n* A node can contain multiple responses, each triggered by a separate condition.

The universal language model uses a default algorithm.\n\n\n\n Automatic retraining \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nWatson Assistant was released as a service in July 2016. Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version. If the version you had selected is no longer supported, Watson Assistant retrains using the version labeled as Previous. This means that your assistant will automatically have the supported technologies applied. Assistants that have been modified during the previous 6 months will not be affected.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-algorithm-version"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.4306765581,"ndcg_cut_10":0.4306765581}}

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04168-7004-8282","score":0.7027385235,"text":"\n* [Learning about CIS architecture and workload isolation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-compute-isolation)\n* [Securing your data in CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-mng-data)\n* [Auditing events for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-at_events)\n* [IAM and Activity Tracker actions by API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-at_iam_CIS)\n* [Managing security and compliance with CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-security-compliance)\n\n\n\n* [Setting up Terraform for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-terraform-setup-cis)\n\n\n\n* Reference\n\n\n\n* [CIS API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cis)\n* CLI reference\n\n\n\n* [CIS CLI change log](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cli-change-log)\n* [CIS CLI reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-cli)\n\n\n\n* [Terraform](https:\/\/registry.terraform.io\/providers\/IBM-Cloud\/ibm\/latest\/docs\/resources\/cis)\n* CIS use cases\n\n\n\n* [Accessing your Cloudant database through CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-access-cloudant-through-cis)\n* [Edge functions use cases](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-edge-functions-use-cases)\n\n\n\n* [Understanding your responsibilities when using CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-responsibilities-cis)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-http-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04168-6066-7283","score":0.6955868006,"text":"\n* [Querying Edge Functions metrics with GraphQL](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-graphql-edge-func)\n* [Querying firewall events with GraphQL](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-graphql-firewall-events-example)\n\n\n\n* Working with alerts\n\n\n\n* [Configuring alert policies](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-configuring-policies)\n* [Configuring webhooks](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-configuring-webhooks)\n* [Creating alerts by type](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-create-alerts-by-type)\n\n\n\n* Working with Bot management\n\n\n\n* [About bot management](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt)\n* [Machine learning models](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-machine-learning-models)\n* [JavaScript detections](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-javascript-detections)\n\n\n\n* Enhancing security\n\n\n\n* [Managing access for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-iam-and-cis)\n* [Learning about CIS architecture and workload isolation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-compute-isolation)\n* [Securing your data in CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-mng-data)\n* [Auditing events for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-at_events)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-http-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.6936240196,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06063-53153-55320","score":0.6898739934,"text":"\nImage Vulnerability Scanner: By default, Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities.

But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-365807-367808","score":0.6880351305,"text":"\nThe images that are not eligible are still displayed, but they do not count toward the total number of images that is set in the retention policy and are not removed.\n* What regions are available?\n\n What regions are available? \n\nTo find out about the regions that are available for IBM Cloud Container Registry, see [Regions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_regions).\n* How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost?\n\n How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost? \n\nThe cost of Vulnerability Advisor is built into the pricing for IBM Cloud Container Registry.

The same package can list multiple vulnerabilities, and in this case, a single package update can address multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability Advisor returns vulnerabilities only when a package fix is published by the distributor. Declared vulnerabilities that aren't fixed yet, or are not going to be fixed, are not reported by Vulnerability Advisor. Therefore, if Vulnerability Advisor does not report any vulnerabilities, there might still be a risk in the image.\n\nFor version 3, the scanning of an image is triggered in one of the following ways:\n\n\n\n* When a new image is pushed to the registry.\n* When a new security notice is released for a package that is installed in the image, the image is queued for scanning, which might take some time to complete.\n* While an image is tagged in the registry, it is scanned every week.\n\n\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023.

Updates can affect the Kubernetes API server version or other components in your Kubernetes master. IBM updates the patch version, but you must update the master major and minor versions.\n\n\n\n About updating the master \n\nHow do I know when to update the master?\n: You are notified in the IBM Cloud console and CLI when updates are available, and can also check the [supported versions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) page.\n\nHow many versions behind the latest can the master be?\n: IBM generally supports three versions of Kubernetes at a time. You can update the Kubernetes API server only to the next version ahead of its current version (n+1). Additionally, your worker nodes can be up to two versions behind the master version (n-2).\n\nFor example, if your current Kubernetes API server version is 1.18 (n) and you want to update to 1.20, you must first update to 1.19 (n+1) and then to 1.20 (n+2). Next, you can update the worker nodes up to two version ahead, such as 1.18 to 1.20 (n+2).\n\nIf your cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version, follow the [version archive instructions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsk8s_version_archive).

Your worker nodes, apps, and resources continue to run.\n\nCan I roll back the update?\n: No, you can't roll back a cluster to a previous version after the update process takes place.

IBM updates the patch version, but you must update the master major and minor versions.\n\n\n\n About updating the master \n\nHow do I know when to update the master?\n: You are notified in the IBM Cloud console and CLI when updates are available, and can also check the [supported versions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) page.\n\nHow many versions behind the latest can the master be?\n: IBM generally supports three versions of Kubernetes at a time. You can update the Kubernetes API server only to the next version ahead of its current version (n+1). Additionally, your worker nodes can be up to two versions behind the master version (n-2).\n\nFor example, if your current Kubernetes API server version is 1.18 (n) and you want to update to 1.20, you must first update to 1.19 (n+1) and then to 1.20 (n+2). Next, you can update the worker nodes up to two version ahead, such as 1.18 to 1.20 (n+2).\n\nIf your cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version, follow the [version archive instructions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsk8s_version_archive).

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06004-15614-17542","score":0.65828228,"text":"\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12467-3399-5495","score":0.6513367891,"text":"\nRotation is allowed only after all locks on the previous secret version are removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating locks in the UI \n\nYou can create up to 1000 locks on a secret by using the Secrets Manager UI.

Sometimes, for example during a security audit, you might want to prevent someone on your team from accidentally deleting a secret. Or, if you plan to rotate your secrets regularly, you might be looking for a way to safely deploy the newest version of a secret after a rotation takes place. With locks, you can build automated workflows that help you to:\n\n\n\n* Indicate that a secret is in use by one or more applications or services.\n* Prevent secret data from being deleted even after a secret expires.\n* Safely delete older versions of secrets after the newest version is fully deployed to your applications.\n* Avoid inadvertent downtime in your applications.\n\n\n\nTo learn about the suggested guidelines for using locks to avoid application downtime, check out [Best practices for rotating and locking secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-rotate-secretsbest-practices-lock-secrets).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you begin, be sure that you have the required level of access.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step. For more information about how Secrets Manager handles rotation requests, see [Manually rotating secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotationmanual-rotate-by-type).\n3.

So again, where are we going to store the secret that's ultimately going to give us access to give us access to authentication and ultimately to the set of permissions that we need here? So that's again going to be the secrets manager service provided, and that service needs to talk to Cloud IAM again. Now that we've got this established, what type of credential do we have here? The credential that we have is called DB config. So let's think about the scenario we just walked through: this DB config allows this lending application a service to be able to have read access or be able to take a specific set of information from a given table within a database that has some IP data and some other highly sensitive information in it. So, in a scenario in which these DB configs are not stored properly or the service that they stored in is compromised, what we ultimately get is a pretty catastrophic scenario for the provider, because the provider of this service of this lending application then has to go and tell its customer that a bad actor was able to take advantage of access that it got wrongfully to its DB config. And, that DB config ultimately allowed that bad actor to steal their data and do whatever they wanted with it against that customer. What we can do to mitigate it again is stored in a safe location or bad actors do not have access and you have the level of data isolation that you're comfortable with as an enterprise. That's where we have secrets manager services.\n\nAgain, secrets manager services help to ensure the secure storage of secrets so that you don't have to worry about data breaches from last credentials or from other types of secrets.

So again, where are we going to store the secret that's ultimately going to give us access to give us access to authentication and ultimately to the set of permissions that we need here? So that's again going to be the secrets manager service provided, and that service needs to talk to Cloud IAM again. Now that we've got this established, what type of credential do we have here? The credential that we have is called DB config. So let's think about the scenario we just walked through: this DB config allows this lending application a service to be able to have read access or be able to take a specific set of information from a given table within a database that has some IP data and some other highly sensitive information in it. So, in a scenario in which these DB configs are not stored properly or the service that they stored in is compromised, what we ultimately get is a pretty catastrophic scenario for the provider, because the provider of this service of this lending application then has to go and tell its customer that a bad actor was able to take advantage of access that it got wrongfully to its DB config. And, that DB config ultimately allowed that bad actor to steal their data and do whatever they wanted with it against that customer. What we can do to mitigate it again is stored in a safe location or bad actors do not have access and you have the level of data isolation that you're comfortable with as an enterprise. That's where we have secrets manager services.\n\nAgain, secrets manager services help to ensure the secure storage of secrets so that you don't have to worry about data breaches from last credentials or from other types of secrets.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12791-59012-61053","score":0.6906147599,"text":"\nBilling \n\nYou can give users access to update account settings, view subscriptions, view offers, apply subscription and feature codes, update spending limits, and track usage by using the Billing service.\n\n\n\nTable 4.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03729-1672-3956","score":0.7302484512,"text":"\nServices For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume.

Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-3313-5682","score":0.7266210318,"text":"\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume.

Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis.

With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount.

If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

To determine whether your service instance provides a free allocation, go to the [Resources list](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/resources) in the IBM Cloud console.

If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-1678-3763","score":0.724917829,"text":"\nIf you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1042894-1044946","score":0.730314672,"text":"\nContact an [IBM Cloud Sales](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog?contactmodule) representative to request a quote for additional server bandwidth.\n* What's the difference between a Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription account?\n\nWith Pay-As-You-Go accounts, you're billed monthly for your resource usage.

You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1033295-1035221","score":0.7186339498,"text":"\n* How am I charged for support?\n\nIf you have Advanced or Premium support, you can track your monthly support costs.

You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.
