The design was similar to that of a mealing stone , which was used to grind grain . The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous , because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin 's parts for other tools .", "title": "Cotton gin", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "805474955_5730-6317-0-587", "score": 0.7729365825653076, "text": "Cotton gin\nThe Indian roller cotton gin , known as the churka or charkha , was introduced to the United States in the mid-18th century , when it was adopted in the southern United States .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 .

Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased . The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War . Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws , and offer far higher productivity than their hand - powered forebears .", "title": "Cotton gin", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "805474955_8286-9499-0-1213", "score": 0.6736013889312744, "text": "Cotton gin\nWhile Whitney 's gin facilitated the cleaning of seeds from short - staple cotton , it damaged the fibers of ( extra-long staple ) cotton ( Gossypium barbadense ) . In 1840 Fones McCarthy received a patent for a `` Smooth Cylinder Cotton - gin '' , a roller gin . McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate . In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade . These descendants of the McCarthy gin are the only gins now used for extra-long staple cotton in the United States .", "title": "Cotton gin", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "805474955_9571-10306-0-735", "score": 0.6729544401168823, "text": "Cotton gin\nPrior to the introduction of the mechanical cotton gin , cotton had required considerable labor to clean and separate the fibers from the seeds .

By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .", "title": "Celts", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "852484941_14789-15346-0-557", "score": 0.7018228769302368, "text": "Celts\nThe Celtic languages form a branch of the larger Indo - European family .

The game is like Lacrosse in one sense -- the block having to go through flags placed about 8 feet apart in the same manner as the rubber ball -- but in the main the old country game of shinty gives the best idea of hockey . The players last night were eighteen in number -- nine on each side -- and were as follows : -- Messrs. Torrance ( captain ) , Meagher , Potter , Goff , Barnston , Gardner , Griffin , Jarvis and Whiting . Creighton ( captain ) , Campbell , Campbell , Esdaile , Joseph , Henshaw , Chapman , Powell and Clouston . The match was an interesting and well - contested affair , the efforts of the players exciting much merriment as they wheeled and dodged each other , and notwithstanding the brilliant play of Captain Torrance 's team Captain Creighton 's men carried the day , winning two games to the single of the Torrance nine .

When a finger touches or rolls onto a surface , the elastic skin deforms . The quantity and direction of the pressure applied by the user , the skin conditions and the projection of an irregular 3D object ( the finger ) onto a 2D flat plane introduce distortions , noise and inconsistencies in the captured fingerprint image . These problems result in inconsistent and non-uniform irregularities in the image . During each acquisition , therefore , the results of the imaging are different and uncontrollable .

The German word for them is Meerschweinchen , literally `` little sea pig '' , which has been translated into Polish as \u015bwinka morska , into Hungarian as tengerimalac , and into Russian as \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 . This derives from the Middle High German name merswin . This originally meant `` dolphin '' and was used because of the animals ' grunting sounds ( which were thought to be similar ) . Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_3899-4355-0-456", "score": 0.8049493432044983, "text": "Guinea pig\nHow the animals came to be called `` pigs '' is not clear .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Gansu province in China and semiarid northeast Brazil have the largest rooftop rainwater harvesting projects going on . Thailand has the largest fraction of the population in the rural area relying on rainwater harvesting ( currently around 40 % ) . Rainwater harvesting was promoted heavily by the government in the 1980s . In the 1990s , after government funding for the collection tanks ran out , the private sector stepped in and provided several million tanks to private households , many of which continue to be used . This is one of the largest examples of self - supply of water worldwide . In Bermuda , the law requires all new construction to include rainwater harvesting adequate for the residents . The U.S. Virgin Islands has a similar law . In Senegal and Guinea - Bissau , the houses of the Diola - people are frequently equipped with homebrew rainwater harvesters made from local , organic materials . In the Irrawaddy Delta of Myanmar , the groundwater is saline and communities rely on mud - lined rainwater ponds to meet their drinking water needs throughout the dry season . Some of these ponds are centuries old and are treated with great reverence and respect . In the United States , until 2009 in Colorado , water rights laws almost completely restricted rainwater harvesting ; a property owner who captured rainwater was deemed to be stealing it from those who have rights to take water from the watershed . Now , residential well owners who meet certain criteria may obtain a permit to install a rooftop precipitation collection system ( SB 09 - 080 ) . Up to 10 large scale pilot studies may also be permitted ( HB 09 - 1129 ) . The main factor in persuading the Colorado Legislature to change the law was a 2007 study that found that in an average year , 97 % of the precipitation that fell in Douglas County , in the southern suburbs of Denver , never reached a stream -- it was used by plants or evaporated on the ground . In Colorado , one can not even drill a water well on properties less than 35 acres ( 14 ha ) . Rainwater catchment is mandatory for new dwellings in Santa Fe , New Mexico .", "title": "Rainwater harvesting", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

It is increasingly recognized that egg quality is of critical importance and women of advanced maternal age have eggs of reduced capacity for normal and successful fertilization . Also , polymorphisms in folate pathway genes could be one reason for fertility complications in some women with unexplained infertility .

Genetic education programs directed at high - school students have been successful in Middle Eastern countries such as Bahrain . Genetic counseling in developing countries has been hampered , however , by lack of trained staff , and couples may refuse prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion despite the endorsement of religious authorities . In Britain , the Human Genetics Commission recommends a strategy comparable with previous strategies in dealing with increased maternal age , notably as this age relates to an increased risk of Down Syndrome . All pregnant women in Britain are offered a screening test from the government - run national health service to identify those at an increased risk of having a baby with Down syndrome . The HGC states that similarly , it is appropriate to offer genetic counseling to consanguineous couples , preferably before they conceive , in order to establish the precise risk of a genetic abnormality in offspring . Under this system the offering of genetic counseling can be refused , unlike , for example , in the US state of Maine where genetic counseling is mandatory to obtain a marriage license for first cousins . Leading researcher Alan Bittles also concluded that though consanguinity clearly has a significant effect on childhood mortality and genetic disease in areas where it is common , it is `` essential that the levels of expressed genetic defect be kept in perspective , and to realize that the outcome of consanguineous marriages is not subject to assessment solely in terms of comparative medical audit '' .

This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity .

At about the same time , colloidal chemistry began its development , and the concepts of bound water emerged . A colloid being something between a solution and a suspension , where Brownian motion is sufficient to prevent sedimentation . The idea of a semipermeable membrane , a barrier that is permeable to solvent but impermeable to solute molecules was developed at about the same time . The term osmosis originated in 1827 and its importance to physiological phenomena realized , but it was n't until 1877 , when the botanist Pfeffer proposed the membrane theory of cell physiology . In this view , the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface , the plasma membrane , and cell water and solutes such as a potassium ion existed in a physical state like that of a dilute solution . In 1889 Hamburger used hemolysis of erythrocytes to determine the permeability of various solutes . By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit , the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume . He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50 % in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells .", "title": "Cell theory", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "852180068_28128-28567-0-439", "score": 0.6312329769134521, "text": "History of evolutionary thought\nThe word evolution ( from the Latin evolutio , meaning `` to unroll like a scroll '' ) was initially used to refer to embryological development ; its first use in relation to development of species came in 1762 , when Charles Bonnet used it for his concept of `` pre-formation , '' in which females carried a miniature form of all future generations .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .", "title": "History of the Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846282869_191-787-0-560", "score": 0.7568778395652771, "text": "Great Wall of China\nGreat Wall of China \u842c\u91cc \u9577\u57ce The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling Map of all the wall constructions General information Type Fortification Country China Coordinates 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff / \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff / 40.68 ; 117.23 Coordinates : 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff / \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff / 40.68 ; 117.23 Technical details Size 21,196 km ( 13,171 mi ) UNESCO World Heritage Site Official name The Great Wall Type Cultural Criteria i , ii , iii , iv , vi Designated 1987 ( 11th session ) Reference no . 438 State Party China Region Asia - Pacific", "title": "Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846282869_21373-22657-0-1284", "score": 0.7562122941017151, "text": "Great Wall of China\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated , in many other locations the Wall is in disrepair .

By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ? ' '' However , the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends , which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston 's busy film schedule .", "title": "Rachel Green", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801186722_11599-12213-0-614", "score": 0.6988028883934021, "text": "The Big Bang Theory\nIn March 2017 , the main cast members ( Galecki , Parsons , Cuoco , Helberg , and Nayyar ) took a 10 % pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings .

Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years .

Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced .

Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after G\u00fcnter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi .

After the war , his widow -- among others -- maintained that Rommel believed an assassination attempt would spark civil war in Germany and Austria , and Hitler would have become a martyr for a lasting cause . Instead , Rommel reportedly suggested that Hitler be arrested and brought to trial for his crimes ; he did not attempt to implement this plan when Hitler visited Margival , France , on 17 June . The arrest plan would have been highly improbable , as Hitler 's security was extremely tight . Rommel would have known this , having commanded Hitler 's army protection detail in 1939 . He was in favour of peace negotiations , and repeatedly urged Hitler to negotiate with the Allies , which is dubbed by some as `` hopelessly naive '' , considering no one would trust Hitler , and `` as naive as it was idealistic , the attitude he showed to the man he had sworn loyalty '' . On 15 July , Rommel wrote a letter to Hitler giving him a `` last chance '' to end the hostilities with the Western Allies , urging Hitler to `` draw the proper conclusions without delay . '' What Rommel did n't know was that the letter took two weeks to reach Hitler because of Kluge 's precautions .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit . These inputs were easily available in at least parts of the states of Punjab , Haryana , and western Uttar Pradesh ; thus , yields increased most in these states .", "title": "Green Revolution in India", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846588693_3711-4082-0-371", "score": 0.6673920154571533, "text": "Green Revolution in India\nThe production of wheat has produced the best results in fueling self - sufficiency of India .
