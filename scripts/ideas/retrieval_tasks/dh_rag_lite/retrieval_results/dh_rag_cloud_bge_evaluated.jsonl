The minimum retention period must be less than or equal to the default retention period, which in turn must be less than or equal to the maximum retention period.\n\nA maximum retention period of 1000 years can be specified for the objects.\n\nTo create a retention policy on a bucket, you need Manager role.

These backups, and any on-demand backups you make, all count toward the above allocation.\n\nIn the above example, if your database contains 2 GB of data and you have not taken any on-demand backups, then your total backup size is 2 GB x 30 = 60 GB. Your backup costs are nil.\n\nIf your database contains 15 GB of data and you have not taken any on-demand backups, then your total backup size is 15 GB x 30 = 450 GB.

With dedicated cores, your resource group is given a single-tenant host with a guaranteed minimum reserve of cpu shares. Your deployments are then allocated the number of CPUs you specify. The cost of dedicated cores is $40 per core per month, and each member gets the selected number of cores. For example, if you provision a deployment with three dedicated cores per member, that is a total of 9 cores, and billed at $360 per month.\n\nDedicated cores are an optional feature.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network.

The SREs apply the latest security standards, detect and remediate malicious activities, and work to ensure reliability and availability of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\nPeriodically, Red Hat OpenShift releases [major, minor, or patch updates](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsupdate_types). These updates can affect the Red Hat OpenShift API server version or other components in your Red Hat OpenShift master. IBM automatically updates the patch version, but you must update the master major and minor versions. For more information, see [Updating the master](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-updatemaster).\n\nWorker nodes in standard clusters are provisioned in to your IBM Cloud infrastructure account. The worker nodes are dedicated to your account and you are responsible to request timely updates to the worker nodes to ensure that the worker node OS and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud components apply the latest security updates and patches.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11949-3497-5869","score":0.7852137089,"text":"\nThis use case is applicable to all industries.\n\n\n\n Deploying Red Hat OpenShift environment as a managed service wherever it is needed \n\nFrequent version upgrades and function modifications that require Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift skills are performed remotely through IBM Cloud managed services.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06004-15614-17542","score":0.6582823992,"text":"\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.6416548491,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame.

The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.7411124706,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06079-7417-9399","score":0.7346400023,"text":"\n: The Kubernetes network proxy is a daemon that runs on every worker node and that forwards or load balances TCP and UDP network traffic for services that run in the cluster.\n\nkube-dashboard\n: The Kubernetes dashboard is a web-based GUI that allows users to manage and troubleshoot the cluster and applications that run in the cluster.\n\nheapster\n: Heapster is a cluster-wide aggregator of monitoring and event data.

For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like kube-system or ibm-system.

You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/service\/).\n\nDeployment\n: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-1160-2754","score":0.7192419767,"text":"\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/depmodels\/cloud\/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/training\/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/35-Connectivity.svg)](https:\/\/community.ibm.com\/community\/user\/publiccloud\/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06501-7-1686","score":0.7148672342,"text":"\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

The search skill uses Discovery to return smart answers to natural language questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Expand your assistant's responsibilities \n\nIf you start small, and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02839-3583-5403","score":0.6773862839,"text":"\nIf your skill will support a language with right-to-left directional text, such as Hebrew, configure the bidirectional capabilities.\n\nClick the options icon from the skill tile ![Skill options icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/kebab.png), and then select Language preferences.

Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls\/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions\/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management\/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-pl-2"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07851-3932-5333","score":0.6517825127,"text":"\nOrganizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards.

In this case an interface can be a dataplane interface (dp0s0) or a virtual interface (dp0bond0.303).

These packets can be traversing or originating on the VRA.\n\nlocal - The firewall is checked against packets which are destined directly for the VRA.\n\nAn interface can have multiple rule sets applied in each direction. They are applied in the order of configuration. Note that it is not possible to firewall traffic originating from the VRA device using per-interface firewalls.\n\nAs an example, to assign the ALLOW_LEGACY rule set to the in option for the bp0s1 interface, you would use the configuration command:\n\nset interfaces dataplane dp0s1 firewall in ALLOW_LEGACY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Control Plane Policing (CPP) \n\nControl plane policing (CPP) provides protection against attacks on the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Router Appliance by allowing you to configure firewall policies that are assigned to desired interfaces and applying these policies to packets entering the VRA.\n\nCPP is implemented when the local keyword is used in firewall policies that are assigned to any type of VRA interface, such as data plane interfaces or loopback. Unlike the firewall rules applied for packets traversing through the VRA, the default action of firewall rules for traffic entering or leaving the control plane is Allow. Users must add explicit drop rules if the default behavior is not desired.\n\nThe VRA provides a basic CPP rule set as template. You can merge it into your configuration by running:\n\nvyatta@vrouter merge \/opt\/vyatta\/etc\/cpp.conf","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-manage-your-ibm-firewalls"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13818-4597-6205","score":0.7201493382,"text":"\nRegardless of the default setting, you can still permit or deny network traffic by creating prefix filters.\n* To create a prefix filter, select Create prefix filter, then complete the following information:\n\n\n\n* Select an action type: Permit or Deny.\n* Enter the network prefix along with its subnet mask (for example, 10.0.0.0\/16).\n* Optionally, enter values for whether the network should be greater than or equal to the subnet mask you chose.\n* Click Save to add the prefix filter.\n\n\n\n\n\nConnections are denied or permitted based on the order of the filters in the list.

Therefore, the configuration migration for the distributed firewall has two stages:\n\n\n\n1. The first stage migrates the firewall rules and the groups to NSX-T.\n2. The second stage creates specific VIFs for each VM that is migrated. And also includes the creation of IP Set-based rules for every VM that is migrated to ensure that there are no security gaps when you move to NSX-T.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that:\n\n\n\n* Tags cannot be applied before you move the VM over to the NSX-T.\n* A VM moved without tags can create a gap in security.\n* Temporary IP Sets are used to allow for a gradual migration while micro-segmentation is enforced for flows between the two NSX environments.\n* If workload VMs must be migrated by using vMotion, then the vMotion must be initiated through the API.

This action allows testing and then, when verified, cut-over to NSX-T load balancing. To migrate the load-balancing service from NSX-V to NSX-T, consider the following steps:\n\n\n\n* Deploy a new NSX-T Edge cluster that contains two Edge node VMs with active or standby configurations.\n* Deploy a T1 router into the Edge cluster with centralized service ports (CSP).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-v2t-config-migration"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07891-4622-5180","score":0.7183005214,"text":"\n* Check whether App ID redirect URIs are not using localhost or 127.0.0.1\n* Check whether Cloud Object Storage is accessible only by using private endpoints\n* Check whether Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network access control lists don't allow egress from 0.0.0.0\/0 to any port\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NIST supplemental guidance \n\nThis control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound network communications traffic.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.7430842519,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

If a condition is specified, your assistant first evaluates the folder condition to determine whether to process the nodes within it.\n* Customizations: Any configuration settings that you apply to the folder are inherited by the nodes in the folder. If you change the digression settings of the folder, for example, the changes are inherited by all the nodes in the folder.\n* Tree hierarchy: Nodes in a folder are treated as root or child nodes based on whether the folder is added to the dialog tree at the root or child level.

Block Storage for VPC volumes, snapshots, and File Storage for VPC file shares are automatically encrypted by using IBM-managed encryption. You can also choose to manage your own encryption for volumes, file shares, and custom images by using customer-managed encryption.\n\n\n\n IBM-managed encryption \n\nBy default, VPC volumes and file shares are encrypted at rest with IBM-managed encryption. The service comes with no additional cost.\n\nIBM-managed encryption uses the following industry standard protocols:\n\n\n\n* AES-256 encryption.\n* Keys are managed in-house with Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).\n* The self-encrypting drives in the Storage architecture are validated for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 Level 2.\n* Storage architecture is validated for Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n* Storage architecture is also validated for Payment Card Industry (PCI), Basel II, California Security Breach Information Act (SB 1386), and EU Data Protection Directive 95\/46\/EC compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Customer-managed encryption \n\nFor end-to-end encryption in the IBM Cloud, you can use customer-managed encryption. Your data is protected while at rest, and also in transit from the storage to the hypervisor and host. You are responsible for encrypting your data outside the VPC.\n\nWith customer-managed encryption, you can bring your own customer root key (CRK) to the cloud or have a [key management service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutkms-for-byok) (KMS) generate a key for you. Root keys are used to encrypt volume, file share, and custom image passphrases with [envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-envelope-encryption-byok), a process that wraps a key with another key.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16065-3261-5275","score":0.7599755526,"text":"\nFor example, this store contains information about each VPC Image resource, such as its name, CRN, and creation date. However, it does not contain the image data itself, which is hosted on the storage devices. All communication between control plane services and the control plane data store is secure and encrypted. \n Block Storage Each zone of each region contains a set of replicated storage devices, which host the data for your VPC volumes. Your data is always encrypted at rest, and is isolated to your account. In addition, you can use [Customer-managed encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about) and your own root keys for end-to-end encryption of your boot and data volumes. Regional buckets use Key Protect for data encrytion at rest. Storage data flows between storage devices and hypervisor nodes only, and does not flow to control nodes. \n Snapshots Snapshots that you create of your volumes are stored in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage and available for regional restoration. Your snapshots are protected using Key Protect for data encrytion at rest. Snapshot data flows between Object Storage and hypervisor nodes only, and does not flow to control nodes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n VPC dependencies \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) depends upon various IBM Cloud integrated services for purposes such as:\n\n\n\n* Hosting the internal microservices of the VPC service\n* Integrating with IBM Cloud and its user interface\n* Storing and backing up service data (including VPC resource metadata)\n* Logging and auditing service events.\n\n\n\nThe following table lists the main dependencies of the VPC service and the purpose of each one:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

For example, when you use an API or interact with the service through the User Interface to configure VPN gateways and VPN connections, all such interactions are encrypted end-to-end. Likewise, data elements that are related to your configuration are encrypted in transit and at rest. No personal or sensitive data is stored, processed, or transmitted. Data at rest is stored in an encrypted database.\n\nAfter the VPN for VPC is provisioned and the network connections are created, the encryption of data that you choose to transmit across the network is your responsibility.\n\n\n\n Instance storage data isolation and encryption \n\nThe instance storage disk or disks, which are attached to the virtual server instance, cannot be shared with any other virtual servers and cannot be accessed by any other virtual servers in the future. They are one-time use, single-attach, for the virtual server that requested the instance storage.\n\nInstance storage data is secured with on-disk encryption. The physical disks that are used for instance storage are self-encrypting with the strong AES-256 encryption standard. The data is automatically decrypted when your instance accesses the data. When your instance is shut down or deleted, the underlying storage space is erased and unrecoverable. At that point, the data is unrecoverable. For more information, see [Introduction to encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-basics).\n\nData is automatically encrypted on the physical media at the drive level. However, customer-managed keys are not supported for instance storage. For sensitive data, it is strongly recommended that users utilize software-based file system encryption such as LUKS for Linux\u00ae or BitLocker for Windows\u00ae.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-mng-data"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07894-1580-3115","score":0.7519373298,"text":"\n* [Data encryption in transit](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-in-transit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile \n\nThe rules related to this control that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v1.2.0 profile in [IBM Cloud\u00ae Security and Compliance Center](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\n\n\n* Check whether App ID email dispatchers are using HTTPS only\n* Check whether Cloud Object Storage is accessible only through HTTPS\n* Check whether Application Load Balancer for VPC is configured to convert HTTP client requests to HTTPS\n* Check whether App ID webhooks are using HTTPS only\n* Check whether App ID redirect URIs are using HTTPS only\n* Check whether Cloud Internet Services (CIS) has TLS mode set to End-to-End CA signed\n* Check whether Application Load Balancer for VPC pool uses the HTTPS protocol for HTTPS listeners\n* Check whether Application Load Balancer for VPC uses HTTPS (SSL & TLS) instead of HTTP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NIST supplemental guidance \n\nEncrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Object Storage stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations.\n\nBy default, all objects that are stored in Object Storage are encrypted by using randomly generated keys and an all-or-nothing-transform (AONT). While this default encryption model provides at-rest security, financial service workloads need full control over the data encryption keys used. Again, Hyper Protect Crypto Services should be used for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using IBM Cloud services outside of a VPC \n\nTo connect to IBM Cloud services from your VPC, you need to use [Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE) for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe). In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and IBM Cloud service on the private backbone. VPE for VPC gives you the experience of controlling all the private addressing within your cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Variation with edge\/transit VPC for public internet access \n\nYou might want to allow consumers to access your service through the public internet.

Use persistent storage in the for stateful apps, core business data or data that must be available due to legal requirements, such as a defined retention period. Persistent storage is also a good option for auditing.\n: Non-persistent storage: Your data can be removed when the container, the worker node, or the cluster is removed. Non-persistent storage is typically used for logging information, such as system logs or container logs, development testing, or when you want to access data from the host's file system.\n\nIf you must persist your data, analyze if your app requires a specific type of storage. When you use an existing app, the app might be designed to store data in one of the following ways.\n: In a file system: The data can be stored as a file in a directory. For example, you could store this file on your local hard disk. Some apps require data to be stored in a specific file system, such as nfs or ext4 to optimize the data store and achieve performance goals.\n: In a database: The data must be stored in a database that follows a specific schema. Some apps come with a database interface that you can use to store your data. For example, WordPress is optimized to store data in a MySQL database. In these cases, the type of storage is selected for you.\n\nDetermine the type of data that you want to store.\n: Structured data: Data that you can store in a relational database where you have a table with columns and rows. Data in tables can be connected by using keys and is usually easy to access due to the pre-defined data model.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16295-7-1721","score":0.682692647,"text":"\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

By referencing values from your secret, you can decouple sensitive information from your deployment to keep your app or job portable. Anyone who is authorized to your project can also view your secrets; be sure that you know that the secret information can be shared with those users.

This offering uses open source, Terraform-based automation to provision and configure IBM Cloud VPC resources that make up the cluster. It deploys the worker nodes in all three zones for the region that you select. With simple steps to define configuration properties and use automated deployment, you can build your own HPC cluster in minutes. In addition, the automation deploys an extra virtual server instance (shown as the Login Node in the architecture diagram) so you can easily build and assemble applications for your cluster right away.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift for HPC enables three interfaces: UI, API, and CLI. The UI involves use of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Cloud\/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation. Any updates that are needed post-deployment regarding Red Hat OpenShift configuration or setup should be performed by using Red Hat OpenShift tools and commands.

The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network. It also hosts a webserver to help the build process of the cluster.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-openshift-runbook-runbook-intro"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10154-7-1896","score":0.8011885285,"text":"\nBenefits and service offerings \n\n[Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/products\/openshift) is an IBM Cloud service, where IBM sets up and helps you manage a cluster of worker nodes that come installed with the OpenShift Container Platform container orchestration software.\n\nTo see a list of the cluster operators that are supported by default, you can run the oc get co command.\n\n\n\n Benefits of using the service \n\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, your developers have a fast and secure way to containerize and deploy enterprise workloads in Kubernetes clusters.

The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions. For more information, see the section on [partitioned tables](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogpartitioned).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09950-7-1844","score":0.7329413891,"text":"\nTables \n\nIn the table from the Tables tab, the value that is displayed in the row count column is an approximate.

Select your column type.\nThe data type restricts the type of data that can be stored in a column. For example, preventing entry of alphanumeric characters into a numeric field.\nData types also help sort data correctly and play a role in optimizing storage. For all these reasons, it is important to pick the appropriate data type.\n3. Specify whether Not null is true or false.\nA column that allows NULL values also allows rows to be inserted with no value in that column. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value.\n4. Specify the default value to be used if no value is specified when a row is inserted.\n5.

In the Intent name field, type a name for the intent.\n\n\n\n* The intent name can contain letters (in Unicode), numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods.\n* The name cannot consist of .. or any other string of only periods.\n* Intent names cannot contain spaces and must not exceed 128 characters. The following are examples of intent names:\n\n\n\n* weather_conditions\n* pay_bill\n* escalate_to_agent\n\n\n\n\n\nA number sign is prepended to the intent name automatically to help identify the term as an intent. You do not need to add it.\n\nKeep the name as short as possible. It's easier to read in the \"Try it out\" pane and conversation logs if you keep the intent name short and concise.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03109-5081-6683","score":0.6816415191,"text":"\nThe Intercom user_id property is the id of the author message object in the Conversation Model that is defined by Intercom.\n\n\n\n* To get the ID, open the channel from a web browser.

This rate is equal to a starting cost of USD $0.105 per hour. You can toggle the provisioned throughput capacity up or down by using the user interface or API. Toggle in increments of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage.

When the team does start to annotate documents, begin with a small set, perhaps no more than 50. Annotate only mentions initially, examine the results, and refine your annotation guidelines and the type system as needed. When you're satisfied with the results of mention annotation, move on to annotate relations and coreferences.\n\nWhile fundamental work is underway to define a set of entity types and mention-annotation guidelines, avoid putting a lot of effort into annotating relation mentions. Mention changes will undo relation annotation work. Do take some time to define a set of relation types and their allowable entity type pairs so that relation type needs are taken into consideration before the entity type inventory is finalized.\n\nExpect the type system to evolve with the experience of people trying to annotate to it. If you revise the type system after you create human annotation tasks, you must decide whether to apply the changes to each task. If you apply the changes, human annotators will have to revisit the documents that they annotated previously.\n\nWhen you test the model, you can review statistics that show how frequently the entity types and relation types occur in your sample documents.

When an alert is triggered, you can be notified through 1 or more notification channels. An alert definition can generate multi-channel notifications.\n\nAn alert is a notification event that you can use to warn about situations that require attention. Each alert has a severity status.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16389-0-2061","score":0.6778088808,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Configuring style and appearance \n\nOn the Style tab, you can configure the overall appearance of the web chat widget.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03329-3417-4930","score":0.7184296846,"text":"\nYou successfully started to build your training data by adding prebuilt content from IBM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Build a dialog \n\nA [dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree.

See [Digressions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-digressions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding responses \n\n\n\n* Keep answers short and useful.\n* Reflect the user's intent in the response.\n\nDoing so assures users that the bot is understanding them, or if it is not, gives users a chance to correct a misunderstanding.\n* Only include links to external sites in responses if the answer depends on data that changes frequently.\n* Avoid overusing buttons. Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response.

After defining the intent, you can add a root-level dialog node that conditions on the intent. As the dialog node response, add a Connect to human agent response type. At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person. Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request. Instead of asking the customer to retry or rephrase the question over and over, your assistant can offer to transfer the customer to a human agent.\n\n\n\nTo design a dialog that can transfer the conversation, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2.

Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it. To ensure that a useful summary is provided to service desk agents when a conversation is transferred to them, add short dialog node names that reflect the node's purpose.

The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.7063520551,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.6511023641,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Different HA techniques tolerate different levels of failure before operations are affected.\n\nYou might want to have quick and easy ways of backing up and restoring data. For example, after a severe or extensive hardware failure, you want the ability to make all the data available on an alternative system as quickly as possible. This requirement is necessary for \"Disaster Recovery\" (DR). A disaster generally means that a database is no longer available in one or more locations. For example, a power outage might cause all systems in a database cluster to fail. Or a large-scale network failure might mean systems in a cluster can't be contacted, even though they continue to work correctly.\n\nAddressing your HA or DR requirements often begins by simplifying the problem into more generic requirements. When you identify your requirements, you can apply the tools and features that help solve the generic needs. Together, the tools and features can address your HA or DR requirements.\n\nDifferent tools and features provide different levels of protection. The different features might be more or less suitable for your specific HA or DR requirement.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08117-7-2019","score":0.7033566833,"text":"\nIBM Cloud Disaster Recovery (DR) and Backup and Restore \n\nLocal service interruption can be caused by many things: hardware failures, bugs, power failures, planned and unplanned maintenance. To minimize a single point of failure, IBM Cloud\u00ae architects create resilient designs that have multiple virtual server instances to provide the highest availability.\n\nHowever, extreme failure events, such as data center wide failures due to network outages, natural disasters, or ransomware are harder to anticipate and plan for. Your Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plan becomes a critical part of recovering from these types of events. Business continuity focuses on the processes and procedures that you implement to help your people minimize interruptions to business operations. Disaster recovery focuses on the IT components and restoring systems after a disaster.\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery components \n\nThe DR model has two main components that deal with what can be tolerated:\n\n\n\n* Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - the maximum time that the service can be down.\n* Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - the maximum amount of data loss.\n\n\n\nZoom\n\n![DR backup diagram.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/df269b100c3499f1efcbb7d030dce8dec25c539b\/ha-infrastructure\/images\/ha-DR-backup-diagram.svg)\n\nFigure 1. DR backup diagram\n\nThese values are directly correlated to both cost and complexity. A lower amount of time and data loss equates to higher cost and complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n DR Strategies \n\nYou can implement your DR strategy in one of two ways:\n\n\n\n Strategy Description Benefits \n\n Cold (Active\/Standby) With a Cold DR strategy, your solution is running in one environment and duplicate resources are available on standby. When an event occurs, you react and build up the standby site. A cold strategy is a reactive approach, where the upfront cost is minimal, other than storage costs for snapshots and backups. The cold approach typically entails higher RPO\/RTO times and is simple to implement.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ha-infrastructure?topic=ha-infrastructure-ha-dr-backup-restore"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00523-8515-10661","score":0.6974343061,"text":"\n[In-region automatic data redundancy](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backupin-region-automatic-data-redundancy) provides applications with high availability access to data.

However, both of these capabilities focus on maintaining access only to the current copy of your data.\n\nPeople and applications can make mistakes and change data in unintended ways. The applications themselves can implement some protection, but sometimes undesirable changes get through. It's useful to be able to restore data from a previous point in time. Database backups support this requirement.\n\nIn addition to protecting your data with high availability and disaster recovery features, consider dumping your database data to a separate location at periodic, regular intervals. Ensure you check and test the backups for confidence that they're complete and correct.\n\nIBM Cloudant supports tools that help you dump the JSON content in databases to a file, and later restore databases from those files.\n\nSpecifically, IBM Cloudant supports tools that help you perform the following tasks:\n\n\n\n* Backup complete databases to a file that is suitable for further processing and off-site storage.\n* Restore complete databases from a previous state that is contained in your backup file.\n\n\n\nThe tools that are supported by IBM Cloudant have the following limitations:\n\n\n\n* _security settings aren't backed up by the tools.\n* Attachments aren't backed up by the tools.\n* Backups aren't precisely accurate \"point-in-time\" snapshots. The reason is that the documents in the database are retrieved in batches, but other applications might be updating documents at the same time. Therefore, the data in the database can change between the times when the first and last batches are read.\n* Index definitions held design documents are backed up, but when data is restored the indexes must be rebuilt.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12523-0-1829","score":0.6959567666,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Understanding business continuity and disaster recovery for projects \n\nDisaster recovery involves a set of policies, tools, and procedures for returning a system, an application, or an entire data center to full operation after a catastrophic interruption.

Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there.

In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14639-1516-2901","score":0.7619764209,"text":"\nEnsure that you do not have any NSX objects that are expanded into the secondary instance that you want to delete.\n3.

When overlap occurs, it retains the leftmost, longest, non-overlapping span. This policy emulates the overlap-handling policy of most regular expression engines.\n\n\n\n* <priority_column>\n\nSpecifies a column of type Text, String, Integer, or Float. Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy.\n* <priority_order>\n\nSpecifies either ascending or descending order. Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy. The ascending order ensures that if a tuple T1 has priority 1 and a tuple T2 has priority 2, T1 has a higher priority than T2. By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical. All inputs with a null <consolidate target> result in a single output tuple, which is chosen randomly among those inputs. This behavior is similar to how tuples are consolidated with an identical span in the target column. The exception to resulting in a single output tuple is if the policy is ContainsButNotEqual. In that case, the null <consolidate target> outputs all inputs with null consolidate target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nExample 1: Consolidate on single column\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the field Person.name of all output tuples and to use the ContainedWithin consolidation policy to resolve overlap.\n\nconsolidate on Person.name\nusing 'ContainedWithin'\n\nExample 2: Consolidate on expression, involving multiple columns\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the result of applying the CombineSpans scalar function to fields Person.firstname and Person.lastname in each output tuple.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09055-87250-88071","score":0.6482211351,"text":"\ne9b08526-3227-406c-b83f-c28844bd952b my-test-key-9\n3ee0d859-2968-4444-8e4d-3d28614f055c my-test-key-10\nbc459a2f-56cb-445e-b4ee-9d1866b57560 my-test-key-11\n62090ba8-7363-408e-9edc-aa9fb69c09be my-test-key-12\n3b4b0511-00df-48e6-ad65-fad35bb6ce17 my-test-key-13\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14\n3d683d56-d340-40cb-b8b6-605dcfded01f my-test-key-15\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n54dd2745-7718-487f-85e6-a67e758dd945 my-test-key-17\n3a5a3b52-6942-463d-9f7a-5b216bbf5123 my-test-key-18\n90138be5-1dd1-4eea-b7c1-73cc8609e7f7 my-test-key-19\ncf0a3d8b-4856-4aa5-be6a-88cca465eab0 my-test-key-20\n\n this is the same list sorted in KEY_ID order\n this is the order we expect when listing keys\n\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-cli-reference-five-two"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04488-121251-122072","score":0.6482211351,"text":"\ne9b08526-3227-406c-b83f-c28844bd952b my-test-key-9\n3ee0d859-2968-4444-8e4d-3d28614f055c my-test-key-10\nbc459a2f-56cb-445e-b4ee-9d1866b57560 my-test-key-11\n62090ba8-7363-408e-9edc-aa9fb69c09be my-test-key-12\n3b4b0511-00df-48e6-ad65-fad35bb6ce17 my-test-key-13\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14\n3d683d56-d340-40cb-b8b6-605dcfded01f my-test-key-15\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n54dd2745-7718-487f-85e6-a67e758dd945 my-test-key-17\n3a5a3b52-6942-463d-9f7a-5b216bbf5123 my-test-key-18\n90138be5-1dd1-4eea-b7c1-73cc8609e7f7 my-test-key-19\ncf0a3d8b-4856-4aa5-be6a-88cca465eab0 my-test-key-20\n\n this is the same list sorted in KEY_ID order\n this is the order we expect when listing keys\n\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cli?topic=cli-key-protect-cli-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08987-121731-122553","score":0.6463249326,"text":"\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14\n3d683d56-d340-40cb-b8b6-605dcfded01f my-test-key-15\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n54dd2745-7718-487f-85e6-a67e758dd945 my-test-key-17\n3a5a3b52-6942-463d-9f7a-5b216bbf5123 my-test-key-18\n90138be5-1dd1-4eea-b7c1-73cc8609e7f7 my-test-key-19\ncf0a3d8b-4856-4aa5-be6a-88cca465eab0 my-test-key-20\n\n this is the same list sorted in KEY_ID order\n this is the order we expect when listing keys\n\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14\n215f592c-3e42-47b6-867c-3cc1cce8a8fd my-test-key-2\n3a5a3b52-6942-463d-9f7a-5b216bbf5123 my-test-key-18\n3b4b0511-00df-48e6-ad65-fad35bb6ce17 my-test-key-13\n\n3d683d56-d340-40cb-b8b6-605dcfded01f my-test-key-15\n3ee0d859-2968-4444-8e4d-3d28614f055c my-test-key-10","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect-cli-plugin"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-94409-96466","score":0.6428003311,"text":"\nConsider using contextual entities as a way to capture these types of proper nouns.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.7076070905,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time.

When your customers chat with your assistant, they might write a compound word as a single word, as hyphenated words, or as separate words. Previously, the variants resulted in different intent confidence scores and different entity mention counts based on your training data.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture.

VPC infrastructure contains a number of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, including Virtual Servers for VPC. A VPC is a public cloud offering that an enterprise uses to establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared [public cloud](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/public) infrastructure. A VPC gives an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\n\nImagine that a cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure is a residential apartment building with multiple families living inside. Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium. No one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission.\n\nA VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic\/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to quickly provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance.

When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance. Instances are available on the x86 architecture. After you provision an instance, you control and manage those infrastructure resources.\n\n\n\n How are virtual server instances for VPC different from other IBM virtual server offerings? \n\nIn the IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for Classic infrastructure offering, instances use native subnet and VLAN networking to communicate to each other within a data center (and single pod). Using subnet and VLAN networking in one pod works well until you must scale up or have large virtual resource demands that require resources to be created between pods. (Adding appliances for VLAN spanning can get expensive and complicated!)\n\nIBM Cloud VPC adds a network orchestration layer that eliminates the pod boundary, creating increased capacity for scaling instances. The network orchestration layer handles all of the networking for all virtual server instances that are within a VPC across regions and zones. With the software-defined networking capabilities that VPC provides, you have more options for multi-vNIC instances and larger subnet sizes.\n\nTo review and start deploying compute resources, see the following topics:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

VPCs give an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\n\nImagine that a cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure is a residential apartment building and multiple families live inside. Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium; no one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission. A VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic\/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to manually provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance.

[Review which resources are encrypted by the key](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources) and verify with the owner of the resources to ensure you no longer require access to that data.\n\nIf you can't delete a key because a retention policy exists on the associated resource, contact the account owner to remove the retention policy on that resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I disable a key? \n\nWhen you disable a key, the key transitions to the Suspended state. Keys in this state are no longer available for encrypt or decrypt operations, and any data that's associated with the key becomes inaccessible.\n\nDisabling a key is a reversible action.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-faqs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.25,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.1510196182,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2900757977}}

See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06968-16615-18789","score":0.684773922,"text":"\nThe number of documents that are allowed per service instance depends on your Discovery plan type.\n\nThe document limit applies to the number of documents in the index.

As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03196-30333-32476","score":0.6951586008,"text":"\nIn the Message before link to web chat field, edit the introductory message to display to the user (in the originating channel) before the link that initiates the transfer.

The user must then click the link to initiate the transfer.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred from one channel to another, the session history and context are preserved, so the destination channel can continue the conversation from where it left off. Note that the message output that contains the Channel transfer response is processed first by the channel that initiates the transfer, and then by the target channel. If the output contains multiple responses (perhaps using different response types), these will be processed by both channels (before and after the transfer). If you want to target individual responses to specific channels, you can do so by editing the response using the JSON editor.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium; no one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission. A VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources.

In the following section, we see how IBM Cloudant is accessed programmatically.\n\nThe examples use Node.js, so if you want to try the code yourself, you need to install node and npm from nodejs.org.\n\nWe can then install the official IBM Cloudant Node.js library with npm install @cloudant\/cloudant. (Npm is the package manager that comes with Node.js - allowing you to access thousands of open source projects and build them into your application for free).\n\nOnce the IBM Cloudant library is installed, we can build some source code. Let's go through this code snippet line-by line:\n\nThe IBM Cloudant service URL is gleaned from the environment variable that we created earlier.\n\nThe @cloudant\/cloudant library is loaded into your Node.js app with the built-in required functions. We then create an instance of the library that is configured with the credentials we stored in the first line. We use the IBM Cloudant object to get a reference to the books database and store it in a variable database. We haven't made any API calls - only created data structures that store credentials and which database that we are working on. The main function calls db.list, which maps 1-1 with the _all_docs endpoint we saw earlier. The parameters passed to db.list must be familiar as the options that _all_docs expects to limit the result set and to return document bodies for each ID.\n\nSee another code snippet that writes a document.\n\nYou can see from the first line that standard JavaScript objects can be used in your code and sent to IBM Cloudant with no conversion, as they turn into JSON natively in JavaScript.\n\nWriting a document is simply a matter of calling db.insert, which maps to a PUT\/POST API call or to _bulk_docs.\n\nTo summarize, the official libraries for IBM Cloudant are Java\u2122, Python, and Nodejs. They are thin wrappers around the IBM Cloudant HTTP API - so it's worth understanding the underlying API to understand all the parameters.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

Ensure the system that you use to connect to the Red Hat OpenShift web console can properly resolve hostnames in the DNS zone for your VMware environment.

Therefore, the queries for hostnames within the VMware instance's root zone are handled by the AD DNS server that is running within your VMware environment.\n\n\n\nAlternately, you can configure your local hosts file with the following entries so you can access the Red Hat OpenShift web console.

Now you can use them in your dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 3: Add a dialog node with slots \n\nA dialog node represents the start of a thread of dialog between your assistant and the user. It contains a condition that must be met for the node to be processed by your assistant. At a minimum, it also contains a response. For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response. You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more. (If you want to learn more about complex dialogs, you can complete the [Building a complex dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial) tutorial.)\n\nThe node that you will add in this step is one that contains slots. Slots provide a structured format through which you can ask for and save multiple pieces of information from a user within a single node. They are most useful when you have a specific task in mind and need key pieces of information from the user before you can perform it. See [Gathering information with slots](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-slots) for more information.\n\nThe node you add will collect the information required to make a reservation at a restaurant.\n\n\n\n1.

If the skill is not associated with an assistant already, add the dialog skill to an assistant, and then view the skill tile from the main page of the assistant. The trained data section lists the number of dialog nodes.\n\nIf the total seems larger than you expected, it might be because the dialog that you build from the application is translated into a JSON object. Some fields that appear to be part of a single node are actually structured as separate dialog nodes in the underlying JSON object.\n\n\n\n* Each node and folder is represented as its own node.\n* Each conditional response that is associated with a single dialog node is represented as an individual node.\n* For a node with slots, each slot, slot found response, slot not found response, slot handler, and if set, the prompt for everything response is an individual node.

When an escalation occurs, your assistant looks at the external node name of the last processed node to learn which user goal was not met successfully.

It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-build"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06063-53153-55320","score":0.6898739934,"text":"\nImage Vulnerability Scanner: By default, Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network.

These updates can affect the Red Hat OpenShift API server version or other components in your Red Hat OpenShift master. IBM automatically updates the patch version, but you must update the master major and minor versions. For more information, see [Updating the master](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-updatemaster).\n\nWorker nodes in standard clusters are provisioned in to your IBM Cloud infrastructure account. The worker nodes are dedicated to your account and you are responsible to request timely updates to the worker nodes to ensure that the worker node OS and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud components apply the latest security updates and patches.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08006-1379-2960","score":0.7865670919,"text":"\nEven though it is shown in the diagram as an option, it is not required to put Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud in your management VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud concepts \n\nRed Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is a managed offering to create your own Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

The service sends event-driven responses to the client's messages, eliminating the need for the client to poll the server.\n* Allows you to establish and use a single authenticated connection indefinitely. The HTTP interfaces require you to authenticate each call to the service.\n* Reduces latency. Recognition results arrive faster because the service sends them directly to the client. The HTTP interface requires four distinct requests and connections to achieve the same results.\n* Reduces network utilization. The WebSocket protocol is lightweight. It requires only a single connection to perform live-speech recognition.\n* Enables audio to be streamed directly from browsers (HTML5 WebSocket clients) to the service.\n* Returns results as soon as they are available when you use a next-generation model or request interim results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using speech recognition parameters \n\nThe service's speech recognition interfaces share largely common parameters for transcribing speech to text.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-features"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button).

A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using.

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports\/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling.

With IBM Cloud VPC, you can provision VNF devices to gain better and more affordable scalability than you would by purchasing physical network devices.\n\nTraffic destined for servers in IBM Cloud VPC must be delivered to healthy VNF devices; otherwise, traffic disruption occurs. You can use network load balancers with routing mode to perform health checks and to ensure that workloads only travel through healthy VNF devices. Because of this, network load balancers with routing mode support only VNF devices as back-end targets.\n\nFor detailed examples of various ways you can deploy your NLB with routing mode, refer to [HA VNF deployments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha&interface=ui).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites for NLB with routing mode \n\nTo support routing mode, you must first create a service-to-service authentication policy for your NLB.

Read this documentation carefully to prevent any users in your organization from creating objects that can not be deleted, even by IBM Cloud administrators.\n\nThis feature can be used by any user that needs long-term data retention in their environment, including but not limited to organizations in the following industries:\n\n\n\n* Financial\n* Healthcare\n* Media content archives\n* Anyone looking to prevent privileged modification or deletion of objects or documents\n\n\n\nRetention policies can also be used by organizations that deal with financial records management, such as broker-dealer transactions, and might need to store data in a non-rewritable and non-erasable format.\n\nImmutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only, see [Integrated Services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage\/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-availabilityservice-availability) for details. It also requires a Standard pricing plan.

No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

Under most scenarios, Aspera high-speed transfer results in significantly increased performance for transferring data, especially across long distances or under unstable network conditions.\n\n\n\n Uploading objects in multiple parts \n\nMultipart upload operations are recommended to write larger objects into Object Storage. An upload of a single object is performed as a set of parts and these parts can be uploaded independently in any order and in parallel. Upon upload completion, Object Storage then presents all parts as a single object. This provides many benefits: network interruptions do not cause large uploads to fail, uploads can be paused and restarted over time, and objects can be uploaded as they are being created.\n\nMultipart uploads are only available for objects larger than 5 MB. For objects smaller than 50 GB, a part size of 20 MB to 100 MB is recommended for optimum performance. For larger objects, part size can be increased without significant performance impact. Multipart uploads are limited to no more than 10,000 parts of 5 GB each up to a maximum object size of 10 TB.\n\nDue to the complexity involved in managing and optimizing parallelized uploads, many developers use libraries that provide multipart upload support.\n\nMost tools, such as the CLIs or the IBM Cloud Console, as well as most compatible libraries and SDKs, will automatically transfer objects in multipart uploads.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the REST API or SDKs \n\nIncomplete multipart uploads do persist until the object is deleted or the multipart upload is aborted. If an incomplete multipart upload is not aborted, the partial upload continues to use resources. Interfaces should be designed with this point in mind, and clean up incomplete multipart uploads.\n\nThere are three phases to uploading an object in multiple parts:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-large-objects"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11315-7883-9702","score":0.702917099,"text":"\nObjects are limited to 200 MB when uploaded through the console unless you use the Aspera High-Speed Transfer plug-in.

Stay to the lower end of the range if the human annotators who will be working on the workspace are not highly specialized in the field. Do not define more than 50.\n\nPlan to spend a good amount of time defining the type system before your team begins any human annotation tasks. When the team does start to annotate documents, begin with a small set, perhaps no more than 50. Annotate only mentions initially, examine the results, and refine your annotation guidelines and the type system as needed. When you're satisfied with the results of mention annotation, move on to annotate relations and coreferences.\n\nWhile fundamental work is underway to define a set of entity types and mention-annotation guidelines, avoid putting a lot of effort into annotating relation mentions.

Do take some time to define a set of relation types and their allowable entity type pairs so that relation type needs are taken into consideration before the entity type inventory is finalized.\n\nExpect the type system to evolve with the experience of people trying to annotate to it. If you revise the type system after you create human annotation tasks, you must decide whether to apply the changes to each task. If you apply the changes, human annotators will have to revisit the documents that they annotated previously.\n\nWhen you test the model, you can review statistics that show how frequently the entity types and relation types occur in your sample documents.

However, to create a reliable statistical model for machine annotation, you want the type system to be as close to final as possible before you begin large-scale annotation tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n When to define roles \n\nUsing roles enables you to define more precise entity types.\n\nEvery entity that you add has a role. Unless you change it, the role name is the same as the entity name. You can choose to define a different role for an entity to capture a more nuanced usage of the mention. The word or phrase to which the role applies is literally an example of an entity type, but in the sentence it plays the role of another entity type. For example, in the phrase, the White House vetoed the bill, we can capture more precisely the meaning of the White House if we annotate both the entity type of FACILITY, and a role of ORGANIZATION or PERSON. White House is a building (FACILITY), but represents the government (ORGANIZATION) or the President of the United States (PERSON) in this construction. The entity type plus the role label creates a more precise classification of the mention in the text.\n\nRoles can also provide you with a way to capture relation information without relying on the use of overlapping mentions. For example, you might want to annotate the text 31-year-old male such that it captures the idea that this is a reference to a person with the attribute age of 31 years and attribute gender of male. By examining the text, we determine that 31-year-old is an age, male is a gender, and together they signify a person. You are dealing with 3 entity types, basically: AGE, GENDER, and PERSON. One approach to representing this would be to annotate 31-year-old as AGE, male as GENDER, and because the distinct mention of a PERSON is missing, but male has come to represent person, the word male can have a role of PERSON. You can then capture relations between the PERSON role and all the attributes of a person that you want to capture.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-typesystem"}],"retriever_scores":{}}

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-index"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09920-5038-6185","score":0.7046126127,"text":"\nCreate a Banking Chatbot \n\nUse Node.js and Watson to detect emotion, identify entities, and discover answers.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/patterns\/create-cognitive-banking-chatbot\/)\n* [Get the Code ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/watson-banking-chatbot?cm_sp=IBMCode-_-create-cognitive-banking-chatbot-_-Get-the-Code)\n* [View the Demo ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Jxi7U7VOMYg&cm_sp=IBMCode-_-create-cognitive-banking-chatbot-_-View-the-Demo)\n* [Build from a Starter Kit ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/console.bluemix.net\/developer\/watson\/create-project?starterKit=a5819b41-0f6f-34cb-9067-47fd16835d04&cm_sp=dw-bluemix-_-code-_-devcenter)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enrich multimedia files using Watson services \n\nBuild an app that enriches audio and visual files using IBM Watson services.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more !","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-sample-apps"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03166-20690-22559","score":0.7036086917,"text":"\n* Pause: This response type pauses the assistant's activity in the chat.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step.

The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16297-5771-7425","score":0.7317079902,"text":"\n1.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow.

This offering uses open source, Terraform-based automation to provision and configure IBM Cloud VPC resources that make up the cluster. It deploys the worker nodes in all three zones for the region that you select. With simple steps to define configuration properties and use automated deployment, you can build your own HPC cluster in minutes. In addition, the automation deploys an extra virtual server instance (shown as the Login Node in the architecture diagram) so you can easily build and assemble applications for your cluster right away.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift for HPC enables three interfaces: UI, API, and CLI. The UI involves use of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Cloud\/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation. Any updates that are needed post-deployment regarding Red Hat OpenShift configuration or setup should be performed by using Red Hat OpenShift tools and commands. If you use the Schematics interface to make changes to configuration properties and reapply those changes, you can cause disruptions to the running Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

To protect your app, you must protect the image and establish checks to ensure the image's integrity.\n\nShould I use a public or a private registry to store my images?\n: Public registries, such as Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker images and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01533-16920-18657","score":0.8343170881,"text":"\nYou can review the security of Docker images that are stored in your namespaces in IBM Cloud Container Registry by using the CLI.\n\n\n\n1.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API. For more information about the phrase operator of the query API, see [Query operators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-operatorsphrase).\n\n\n\n\n\n A short query returns irrelevant results \n\nIt might be that your query contains too many stop words and not enough distinct terms to trigger a meaningful search. When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09988-7-1841","score":0.6837612391,"text":"\nQueries \n\n\n\n Recent queries \n\nOn the page, you can see the most recent 2000 queries.\n\nYou do not need to have the administrator privileges to view recent queries.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02597-3131-5174","score":0.6384276748,"text":"\nPlans can share APIs, but whether subscription approval is required depends upon the Plan itself.

Unlike previous plans, the Plus plan is a user-based billing plan. It measures usage by the number of unique users that interact with your assistant over a given time period. To get the most from the plan, if you build your own client application, design your app such that it defines a unique ID for each user, and passes the user ID with each \/message API call. For the built-in integrations, the session ID is used to identify user interactions with the assistant. See [User-based plans](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-services-informationservices-information-user-based-plans) for more information.\n\n\n\nPlus plan limits\n\n Artifact Limit \n\n Assistants 100 \n Contextual entities 20 \n Contextual entity annotations 2,000 \n Dialog nodes 100,000 \n Entities 1,000 \n Entity synonyms 100,000 \n Entity values 100,000 \n Intents 2,000 \n Intent user examples 25,000 \n Integrations 100 \n Logs 30 days \n Skills 50 \n\n\n\nUser-based Premium plan\n: The Premium plan now bases its billing on the number of active unique users.

See [User-based plans](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-services-informationservices-information-user-based-plans) for more information.\n\nExisting Premium plan service instances are not impacted by this change; they continue to use API-based billing methods.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02953-12940-14393","score":0.6511628628,"text":"\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\nYou can see the number of dialog nodes in a dialog skill from the assistant tile.

Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16423-6502-8727","score":0.6351783276,"text":"\nIf you want to build a model that is optimized for your data, but do not want to upload the data as-is to Knowledge Studio for privacy reasons, you can strip the documents of any personally identifiable information (PII) first, and then use those anonymized documents to train the model. Do not redact the information or replace it wholesale with variables. For best results, replace the real information with fake information of the same type.\n\nFor example, if the PII that you want to protect is client names, then instead of redacting each name or replacing each name with a variable, such as USER_NAME, replace each name with a fake name that uses a variety of typical name syntax styles, such as Jane Doe, Mr. Smith, Dietrich, or Dr. Jones, PhD. Consider writing a script that concatenates a variety of first and last names, and titles and last names, and adds last names alone to create fake names that can be inserted into the document to replace instances of real user names. The goal is to simulate as closely as possible real values in the source documents. If the same text (USER_NAME) is used in the documents or text is redacted, you will basically be training the model to expect all names to have that same value or be redacted. When the model is used at runtime on new documents, and encounters never-seen-before names in all their variability, you want it to be able to recognize them as names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding documents to a workspace \n\nTo train a model, you must add documents that are representative of your domain content to your workspace.\n\n\n\n About this training task \n\nAs a best practice, start with a relatively small collection of documents. Use these documents to train human annotators (if your workspace involves human annotation) and to refine the annotation guidelines. Small documents can help human annotators identify coreference chains throughout the document. As annotation accuracy improves, you can add more documents to the corpus to provide greater depth to the training effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo add documents to a workspace:\n\n\n\n1.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00472-1437-3360","score":0.798887074,"text":"\nYou can query the API by using one of the following methods: URI, IBM Cloudant Dashboard, curl, or a browser plug-in, such as Postman or RESTClient.\n\nSee the following example design document that defines a search index:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"_design\/search_example\",\n\"indexes\": {\n\"animals\": {\n\"index\": \"function(doc){ ... }\"\n}\n}\n}\n\n\n\n Search index partitioning type \n\nA search index inherits the partitioning type from the options.partitioned field of the design document that contains it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Index functions \n\nIf you attempt to index by using a data field that doesn't exist, it fails. To avoid this problem, use an appropriate [guard clause](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-searchindex-guard-clauses).\n\nYour indexing functions operate in a memory-constrained environment where the document itself forms a part of the memory that is used in that environment. Your code's stack and document must fit inside this memory. Documents are limited to a maximum size of 64 MB.\n\nWithin a search index, don't index the same field name with more than one data type. If the same field name is indexed with different data types in the same search index function, you might get an error. This error occurs when you query the search index that says the field was indexed without position data. For example, don't include both of these lines in the same search index function. These lines index the myfield field as two different data types, a string \"this is a string\" and a number 123.\n\nindex(\"myfield\", \"this is a string\");\nindex(\"myfield\", 123);\n\nThe function that is contained in the index field is a JavaScript function that is called for each document in the database.

Instance storage is close to the compute resources of the virtual server and on a high-speed communication channel independent from the network. An instance storage disk provides fast, affordable, temporary storage to improve the performance of cloud native workloads with scratch space, caching buffers, or a place for replicated data. The data that is stored on instance storage is ephemeral, which means that the data is tied directly to the instance lifecycle. The instance storage disk is automatically created and destroyed with the instance. Instance storage data is not lost when an instance is only rebooted.\n\nInstance storage is a complementary storage technology to the boot and block storage volumes for data offered with VPC. Some examples of use cases for instance storage disks are:\n\n\n\n* Distributed File Systems: Technologies such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which do triplication of the data across multiple servers. These technologies can improve read bandwidth and retain reliability by maintaining multiple copies of the data. It is recommended that at least three copies of the data, ideally across availability zones, are maintained when using Instance Storage for these workloads.\n* Transactional jobs: Transaction processing usually creates a significant amount of temporary files. Instance Storage is a great place to temporarily store that data while the transactions are processed, with the result stored persistently on a data volume.\n* Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Improve performance for large geographically distributed applications with instance storage for fast, low cost, local data caching.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lifecycle of instance storage \n\nThe lifecycle of instance storage is critical to understand. Without a proper understanding of its temporary nature, workloads could experience data loss.\n\nThe instance storage space is allocated and attached to the virtual server instance at the time of provisioning. It is an integral and inseparable element of the virtual server instance. If you reboot your instance (either from its operating system or through an IBM Cloud Management interface), the instance storage data is retained and the instance is reconnected to its original disks.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-instance-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05126-7854-8791","score":0.7098181248,"text":"\nYou can manage your keys manually by supplying your own encryption keys - referred to as Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).\n\n\n\n\n\n Archive rules \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage Archive is a low-cost option for data that is rarely accessed.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05166-7-1684","score":0.7303217053,"text":"\nRelease notes for Object Storage \n\nNews on the latest releases from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage provide the updates you need on all things related to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n 14 June 2023 \n\nNew location!\n: Buckets can now be created in a Regional (MZR) configuration in Madrid, Spain.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.8772153153,"ndcg_cut_10":0.8772153153}}

Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03043-7-2031","score":0.6892732382,"text":"\nAdding a skill to your assistant \n\nCustomize your assistant by adding to it the skills it needs to satisfy your customers' goals.\n\nYou can create the following types of skills:\n\n\n\n* Dialog skill: Uses Watson natural language processing and machine learning technologies to understand user questions and requests, and respond to them with answers that are authored by you.\n* Search skill: For a given user query, uses the IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to search a data source of your self-service content and return an answer.\n\n\n\nTypically, you create a skill of each type first. Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03329-4-1522","score":0.6878814101,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

While you develop your skill, you use the Try it out pane to verify that your assistant recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and to make corrections as needed.\n\nFrom the User conversations page, you can analyze actual interactions between the assistant you used to deploy the skill and your users. Based on those interactions, you can make corrections to improve the accuracy with which intents and entities are recognized by your dialog skill. It is difficult to know exactly how your users will ask questions, or what random messages they might submit, so it is important to frequently analyze real conversations to improve your dialog skills.\n\nFor a Watson Assistant instance that includes multiple assistants, there might be times when it is useful to use message data from the dialog skill of one assistant to improve the dialog skill used by another assistant within that same instance.\n\nAs an example, say you have a Watson Assistant instance named HelpDesk. You might have both a Production assistant and a Development assistant in your HelpDesk instance. When working in the dialog skill for the Development assistant, you can use logs from the Production assistant messages to improve the Development assistant's dialog skill.\n\nAny edits you then make within the dialog skill for the Development assistant will only affect the Development assistant's dialog skill, even though you\u2019re using data from messages sent to the Production assistant.\n\nSimilarly, if you create multiple versions of a skill, you might want to use message data from one version to improve the training data of another version.\n\nYou cannot access log data from assistants that were created in other service instances.\n\n\n\n Picking a data source \n\nThe term data source refers to the logs compiled from conversations between customers and the assistant or custom application by which a dialog skill was deployed.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-logs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.3333333333,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.1480409555}}

The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload.\n\nHow can I control how many worker nodes go down at a time during an update or reload?\n: If you need all your worker nodes to be up and running, consider [resizing your worker pool](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_pool_resize) or [adding stand-alone worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_add) to add more worker nodes. You can remove the additional worker nodes after the update is completed.\n\nIn addition, you can create a Kubernetes config map that specifies the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time, such as during an update. Worker nodes are identified by the worker node labels. You can use IBM-provided labels or custom labels that you added to the worker node.\n\nThe Kubernetes config map rules are used for updating worker nodes only.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-update"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06209-6757-8643","score":0.7747767568,"text":"\n* [Updating classic worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-updateworker_node).\n* [Updating VPC worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-updatevpc_worker_node).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updating classic worker nodes \n\nYou notice that an update is available for your worker nodes in a [classic infrastructure](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers) cluster.

For more information, see the [v1 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v1).\n\nNote: The v1 authoring methods create and modify workspaces rather than skills. A workspace is a container for the dialog and training data (such as intents and entities) within a dialog skill. If you create a new workspace using the API, it will appear as a new dialog skill in the Watson Assistant user interface.\n\nFor a list of the available API methods, see [API methods summary](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-methods).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03353-1684-3127","score":0.7849906087,"text":"\nLanguage [Actions skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-actions-add) [Dialog skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-dialog-add) [Search skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-search-add) \n\n English (en) GA GA GA \n Arabic (ar) GA GA GA \n Chinese (Simplified) (zh-cn) GA GA GA \n Chinese (Traditional) (zh-tw) GA GA GA \n Czech (cs) GA GA GA \n Dutch (nl) GA GA GA \n French (fr) GA GA GA \n German (de) GA GA GA \n Italian (it) GA GA GA \n Japanese (ja) GA GA GA \n Korean (ko) GA GA GA \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA GA GA \n Spanish (es) GA GA GA \n Universal (xx) GA GA GA \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Intent feature support details \n\n\n\nTable 3.

Documents with low scores are candidates to be rejected and returned to the human annotator for improvement.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nWhen you examine inter-annotator agreement, you examine documents that were annotated by more than one human annotator. If a document is not shared across multiple annotation sets and human annotators, there is no inter-annotator agreement to calculate. When you add annotation sets to a task, ensure that the sets that you want to compare contain the same overlapping documents. You can see which documents are in an annotation set by opening the Assets> Documents page, clicking the Annotation Sets tab, and then clicking the names of the sets.\n\nYou might experience situations in which no overlapping documents are found. This might happen, for example, if you create annotation sets in two rounds and add them to the same task. Even though the annotation sets were created at about the same time, they don't have any documents in common.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-build-groundtruth"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16464-13891-15856","score":0.8013997078,"text":"\nIn general, aim for a score of .8 out of 1, where 1 means perfect agreement.

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03282-3030-5026","score":0.6833114624,"text":"\nYou can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response.

Here are some approaches you can use to address common goals.\n\n\n\n* Returning the user's input: You can capture the exact text uttered by the user and return it in your response. Use the following SpEL expression in a response to repeat the text that the user specified back in the response:\n\nYou said: <? input.text ?>.\n\nIf autocorrection is on, and you want to return the user's original input before it was corrected, you can use <? input.original_text ?>. But, be sure to use a response condition that checks whether the original_text field exists first.\n* Determining the number of words in user input: You can perform any of the supported String methods on the input.text object. For example, you can find out how many words there are in a user utterance by using the following SpEL expression:\n\ninput.text.split(' ').size()\n\nSee [Expression language methods for String](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methodsdialog-methods-strings) to learn about more methods you can use.\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template. Review available service plans and pricing information for each resource that you are about to create. Some services come with a limit per IBM Cloud account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faq"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.6666666667,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.765360637,"ndcg_cut_5":0.765360637,"ndcg_cut_10":0.921786879}}
