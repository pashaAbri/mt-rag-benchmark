Guinea pigs were used in some major advertising campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s , notably for Egg Banking plc , Snapple , and Blockbuster Video .

The 2009 Walt Disney Pictures movie G - Force features a group of highly intelligent guinea pigs trained as operatives of the U.S. government . A video game based on the movie was also released .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West , European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial `` Great Wall '' in his Travels . Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall . Thus , Father Martino Martini 's mistaken claim that the Wall had `` lasted right up to the present time without injury or destruction '' since the time of Qin was accepted as fact by the 18th - century philosophes .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_62032-63946-0-1914","score":30.916116184,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nEarly European accounts were mostly modest and empirical , closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall . However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice . The illustrations of the Great Wall by Lieutenant Henry William Parish during this mission would be reproduced in influential works such as Thomas Allom 's 1845 China , in a series of views .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_17856-18820-0-960","score":30.8248788072,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nWall configurations were changed to reflect the new borders under the Qin . General Meng Tian erected walls beyond the northern loop of the Yellow River , effectively linking the border walls of Qin , Zhao , and Yan . Concurrent to the building of the frontier wall was the destruction of the walls within China that used to divide one warring state from another -- contrary to the outer walls , which were built to stabilize the newly united China , the inner walls threatened the unity of the empire . In the following year , 214 BC , Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north . This work was completed probably by 212 BC , signalled by Qin Shi Huang 's imperial tour of inspection and the construction of the Direct Road ( \u76f4\u9053 ) connecting the capital Xianyang with the Ordos .

Some contemporary scholarship , however , discounts this approach , instead considering `` an authentic Hamlet an unrealisable ideal ... there are texts of this play but no text '' . The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different Hamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis .

These spores grow into multicellular individuals ( called gametophytes in the case of plants ) without a fertilization event . These haploid individuals give rise to gametes through mitosis . Meiosis and gamete formation therefore occur in separate generations or `` phases '' of the life cycle , referred to as alternation of generations . Since sexual reproduction is often more narrowly defined as the fusion of gametes ( fertilization ) , spore formation in plant sporophytes and algae might be considered a form of asexual reproduction ( agamogenesis ) despite being the result of meiosis and undergoing a reduction in ploidy .

While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself ( drawn from a vein by phlebotomy ) , it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis ; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy .","title":"Bone marrow","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"825171915_1986-3071-0-1085","score":35.1177465635,"text":"Bone marrow\nThe composition of marrow is dynamic , as the mixture of cellular and non-cellular components ( connective tissue ) shifts with age and in response to systemic factors .

While the precise mechanisms underlying marrow regulation are not understood , compositional changes occur according to stereotypical patterns . For example , a newborn baby 's bones exclusively contain hematopoietically active `` red '' marrow , and there is a progressive conversion towards `` yellow '' marrow with age . In adults , red marrow is found mainly in the central skeleton , such as the pelvis , sternum , cranium , ribs , vertebrae and scapulae , and variably found in the proximal epiphyseal ends of long bones such as the femur and humerus .

Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation .

This derives from the Middle High German name merswin . This originally meant `` dolphin '' and was used because of the animals ' grunting sounds ( which were thought to be similar ) . Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) .

The virus can not pass through a synthetic condom , but a male condom 's effectiveness is limited because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it . Neither type of condom prevents contact with the scrotum , anus , buttocks , or upper thighs , areas that may come in contact with ulcers or genital secretions during sexual activity . Protection against herpes simplex depends on the site of the ulcer ; therefore , if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms , abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission .

In return for the Soviet Union 's entrance into the war against Japan , the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island .

Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible . Additionally , counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment , and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well . While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations ( such as sub-Saharan African countries ) , a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_15694-16431-0-737","score":38.8221598698,"text":"Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs can learn complex paths to food , and can accurately remember a learned path for months .

The Pacific Ocean is the primary influence on the weather , contributing storms from about October to May , with spring being the wettest season . Snow falls frequently during the winter , contributed largely by the lake - effect from the Great Salt Lake . The only source of precipitation in the summer is monsoon moisture moving north from the Gulf of California . Summers are hot , frequently reaching above 100 \u00b0 F ( 38 \u00b0 C ) , while winters are cold and snowy . However , winters are warmer than one would expect at this elevation and latitude , due to the Rocky Mountains to the east and north that usually block powerful polar highs from affecting the state during the winter . Temperatures rarely fall below 0 \u00b0 F ( - 18 \u00b0 C ) , but frequently stay below freezing .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats .

The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

This substance was discharged from seven mills located close to the Tribal community of Penobscot people , along the Penobscot river . Dioxins , which are highly potent toxic chemicals that may cause cancer and other health problems , were being poured daily into this adjacent river , the Penobscot . A Penobscot woman , Rebecca Sockbeson , a Penobscot , is quoted saying that her people have survived on fish from this river , but `` now we are dying from it .

Gerard Sanders portrayed the character in a brief memorial slideshow presentation in the beginning of the 2008 film Iron Man . Slattery first portrayed the character in the 2010 film Iron Man 2 where it is revealed that he is one of S.H.I.E.L.D. 's co-founders . Having placed a message for Tony Stark in a film reel , Howard gives Tony closure in their strained relationship while providing his son a diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo to perfect the Arc Reactor . Cooper first portrayed a younger iteration in the 2011 film Captain America : The First Avenger that aided in the Super Soldier Project and then the Strategic Scientific Reserve . His contributions include providing Steve Rogers with both a costume and shield . After the Hydra battleship that Rogers raided crashed in the ocean , Stark made attempts to find Rogers before his expeditions led to the Tesseract . Cooper reprises his role of Howard Stark in Marvel One - Shot film Agent Carter , where Peggy Carter helps Stark during S.H.I.E.L.D. 's formation . A still photograph of Cooper as Stark appears in the 2014 film Captain America : The Winter Soldier . Slattery reprised his role in the 2015 film Ant - Man . In a flashback in the late - 1980s , he witnesses Hank Pym 's resignation from S.H.I.E.L.D. after the discovery of them trying to replicate the Pym Particles without consent . While objecting to Pym 's actions , Stark felt that Mitchell Carson did deserve Hank 's punch following Mitchell 's inappropriate comment about Janet van Dyne . Slattery again reprised the role in the 2016 film Captain America : Civil War . It shows that the car crash said to be the cause of the deaths of Howard and Maria Stark on December 16 , 1991 was caused by Bucky Barnes while under Hydra 's control . Barnes caused the car to crash , and then killed the Starks with his bare hands after they survived the initial impact .","title":"Howard Stark","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{}}

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today .

Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_25412-26384-0-972","score":37.0330670223,"text":"Guinea pig\nPoor diets for guinea pigs have been associated with muscular dystrophy , metastatic calcification , difficulties with pregnancy , vitamin deficiencies , and teeth problems .

They do not respond well to sudden changes in their diet and they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types . A constant supply of hay is generally recommended , as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop bad habits if food is not present , such as chewing on their hair .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea , leading people to think they had originated there . `` Guinea '' was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far - off , unknown country , so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal 's exotic appeal . Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America . A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 . Others believe `` guinea '' may be an alteration of the word coney ( rabbit ) ; guinea pigs were referred to as `` pig coneys '' in Edward Topsell 's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_14755-15684-0-929","score":37.3994481149,"text":"Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species .

Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage . However , as lagomorphs , rabbits have different nutritional requirements , so the two species can not be fed the same food .

Safer bedding materials made from hardwoods ( such as aspen ) , paper products , and corn cob materials are other alternatives . Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages ; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them , and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces , making it difficult to remove .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_45056-45809-0-753","score":43.0585349947,"text":"Guinea pig\nAndean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat , and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy .

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today .

The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6713860725,"ndcg_cut_10":0.8278123145}}

Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick , but is more difficult to use . Consequently , stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation , inner and outer brims , and gateways of the wall . Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall , with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm ( 12 in ) tall , and about 23 cm ( 9.1 in ) wide .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644 , after Beijing had already fallen to Li Zicheng 's rebels . Before this time , the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid , but this time it was for conquest . The gates at Shanhai Pass were opened on May 25 by the commanding Ming general , Wu Sangui , who formed an alliance with the Manchus , hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from Beijing .

Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years .

Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends .

The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends . '' Ultimately , Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes , two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired , thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show , becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25 .","title":"Rachel Green","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.3333333333,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.296081911,"ndcg_cut_5":0.296081911,"ndcg_cut_10":0.4441228664}}

Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased .

Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .

Institutions such as the Folger Shakespeare Library in the United States worked to ensure constant , serious study of Shakespearean texts and the Royal Shakespeare Company in the United Kingdom worked to maintain a yearly staging of at least two plays .","title":"Shakespeare's reputation","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"854199200_2615-3639-0-1024","score":16.3822478635,"text":"Shakespeare's influence\nShakespeare 's works have been a major influence on subsequent theatre . Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature ( with Macbeth , Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world 's greatest plays ) , and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language . Specifically , in plays like Hamlet , Shakespeare `` integrated characterization with plot , '' such that if the main character was different in any way , the plot would be totally changed . In Romeo and Juliet , Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre ( previous to Shakespeare , romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy ) . Through his soliloquies , Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character 's inner motivations and conflict ( up until Shakespeare , soliloquies were often used by playwrights to `` introduce ( characters ) , convey information , provide an exposition or reveal plans '' ) .","title":"Shakespeare's influence","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832774108_73434-73999-0-565","score":16.2261452053,"text":"Anthony Eden\nEden was notoriously `` unclubbable '' and offended Churchill by declining to join The Other Club .

The long - lived belief that the Romantics were the first generation to truly appreciate Shakespeare and to prefer him to Ben Jonson is contradicted by praise from writers throughout the 18th century . Ideas about Shakespeare that many people think of as typically post-Romantic were frequently expressed in the 18th and even in the 17th century : he was described as a genius who needed no learning , as deeply original , and as creating uniquely `` real '' and individual characters ( see Timeline of Shakespeare criticism ) . To compare Shakespeare and his well - educated contemporary Ben Jonson was a popular exercise at this time , a comparison that was invariably complimentary to Shakespeare . It functioned to highlight the special qualities of both writers , and it especially powered the assertion that natural genius trumps rules , that `` there is always an appeal open from criticism to nature '' ( Samuel Johnson ) .","title":"Shakespeare's reputation","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"840297813_23286-25241-0-1955","score":16.1429326395,"text":"Shakespeare's reputation\nShakespeare became an important emblem of national pride in the 19th century , which was the heyday of the British Empire and the acme of British power in the world . To Thomas Carlyle in On Heroes , Hero - Worship , and the Heroic in History ( 1841 ) , Shakespeare was one of the great poet - heroes of history , in the sense of being a `` rallying - sign '' for British cultural patriotism all over the world , including even the lost American colonies : `` From Paramatta , from New York , wheresoever ... English men and women are , they will say to one another , ' Yes , this Shakespeare is ours ; we produced him , we speak and think by him ; we are of one blood and kind with him ' '' ( `` The Hero as a Poet '' ) . As the foremost of the great canonical writers , the jewel of English culture , and as Carlyle puts it , `` merely as a real , marketable , tangibly useful possession '' , Shakespeare became in the 19th century a means of creating a common heritage for the motherland and all her colonies . Post-colonial literary critics have had much to say of this use of Shakespeare 's plays in what they regard as a move to subordinate and deracinate the cultures of the colonies themselves . Across the North Sea , Shakespeare remained influential in Germany . In 1807 , August Wilhelm Schlegel translated all of Shakespeare 's plays into German , and such was the popularity of Schlegel 's translation ( which is generally regarded as one of the best translations of Shakespeare into any language ) that German nationalists were soon starting to claim that Shakespeare was actually a German playwright who just written his plays in English . By the middle of the 19th century , Shakespeare had been incorporated into the pantheon of German literature . In 1904 , a statue of Shakespeare was erected in Weimar showing the Bard of Avon staring into the distance , becoming the first statue built to honor Shakespeare on the mainland of Europe .","title":"Shakespeare's reputation","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end - of - season World Championship Game between the two league champions ( later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game ) .

That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America .

This storm affected only the Southeastern US coast , as far south as Savannah , GA , with little to no snow measured west of I - 95 . Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina . These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level , usually propelled southward from Arctic high pressure over the Northeastern or New England states . If the storms track sufficiently far to the east , snow will be limited to the eastern part of the state ( as with the December 22 - 23 , 1989 storm ) . If the cyclones travel close to the coast , warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean , bringing a rain \/ snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont , foothills and mountains , as with the January 22 , 1987 storm .

Consequently , prices of raw cotton rose . At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , cotton was grown in small plots in the Old World -- the uncrowned Americas were far better able to recruit available land with the potential for new cotton production . Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies , particularly in Haiti , but Haitian cotton production was halted by the Haitian Revolution in 1791 . The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable , leading to widespread growth of cotton plantations in the United States and Brazil . ( A strain of cotton seed brought to Natchez in 1806 , Gossypium hirsutum , would become the parent genetic material for over 90 % of world cotton production to come : it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to pick . ) The Americas , particularly the U.S. , had labor shortages and high priced labor , which made slavery attractive .

In 1840 Fones McCarthy received a patent for a `` Smooth Cylinder Cotton - gin '' , a roller gin . McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate . In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade .

The late antiquity historian Ammianus Marcellinus ( 330 ? -- 395 ? ) mentioned `` summits of lofty walls '' enclosing the land of Seres , the country that the Romans believed to be at the eastern end of the Silk Road . In legend , the tribes of Gog and Magog were said to have been locked out by Alexander the Great with walls of steel . Later Arab writers and travellers , such as Rashid - al - Din Hamadani ( 1248 -- 1318 ) and Ibn Battuta ( 1304 -- 1377 ) , would erroneously identify the Great Wall in China with the walls of the Alexander romances . Soon after Europeans reached Ming China in the early 16th century , accounts of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe , even though no European would see it with their own eyes for another century . The work A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions by Gaspar da Cruz ( c. 1520 -- 70 ) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted , `` a Wall of an hundred leagues in length . And some will affirme to bee more than a hundred leagues . '' Another early account written by Bishop Juan Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza ( 1550 -- 1620 ) reported a wall five hundred leagues long , but suggested that only one hundred leagues were man - made , with the rest natural rock formations . The Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci ( 1552 -- 1610 ) mentioned the Great Wall once in his diary , noting the existence of `` a tremendous wall four hundred and five miles long '' that formed part of the northern defences of the Ming Empire .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_5967-6843-0-835","score":30.1474509172,"text":"Great Wall of China\nBecause of the wall 's association with the First Emperor 's supposed tyranny , the Chinese dynasties after Qin usually avoided referring to their own additions to the wall by the name `` Long Wall '' .

During the 1933 defence of the Great Wall , inadequately - equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of Japanese troops for several months . Using the cover of the Great Wall , the Chinese -- who were at times only armed with broadswords -- were able to beat off a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment . With the Chinese forces eventually overrun , the subsequent Tanggu Truce stipulated that the Great Wall was to become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo . Even so , the determined defence of the Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness of the Chinese people . The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked up this symbol in his poetry during his `` Long March '' escaping from Kuomintang prosecution . Near the end of the trek in 1935 , Mao wrote the poem `` Mount Liupan '' that contains the well - known line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present day : `` Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men '' ( \u4e0d \u5230 \u957f\u57ce \u975e \u597d\u6c49 ) . Another noteworthy reference to the Great Wall is in the song `` The March of the Volunteers '' , whose words came from a stanza in Tian Han 's 1934 poem entitled `` The Great Wall '' . The song , originally from the anti-Japanese movie Children of Troubled Times , enjoyed continued popularity in China and was selected as the provisional national anthem of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) at its establishment in 1949 .
