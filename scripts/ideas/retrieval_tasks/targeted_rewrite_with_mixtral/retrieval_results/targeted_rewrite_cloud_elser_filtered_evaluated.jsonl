Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port.

In addition, you can configure custom alerts from panels in a dashboard, by using the REST API, or in the Alerts section of the web UI.\n\nIn the IBM Cloud Monitoring service, you can define any of the following types of alerts:\n\n\n\n* Downtime: Use this type of alert to monitor sources and alert when they are down, for example, a bare metal.\n* Metric: Use this type of alert to monitor time-series metrics and alert when they reach the thresholds defined.\n* PromQL: Use this type of metric to monitor metrics by using a PromQL query.\n* Event: Use this type of alert to monitor occurrences of specific events and alert when they reach the thresholds defined. For example, you can use this alert to monitor when a number of unauthorize access requests are reported.\n* Anomaly Detection: Use this type of alert to monitor hosts based on historical behaviors and alert when they deviate from the expected pattern.\n\nThis type of alert is deprecated. You can only manage existing alerts of this type.\n* Group Outlier: Use this type of alert to monitor hosts and be notified when 1 acts differently from the rest.\n\nThis type of alert is deprecated.

Data is not ready until the initial indexing of a new metric source is completed. Therefore, new sources such as clusters, platform metrics, or systems that you configure, all take some time to become visible through the Monitoring UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sending notifications \n\nYou can configure single alerts and multi-condition alerts to notify about problems that may require attention. When an alert is triggered, you can be notified through 1 or more notification channels. An alert definition can generate multi-channel notifications.\n\nAn alert is a notification event that you can use to warn about situations that require attention. Each alert has a severity status.

The agent type determines the metrics that are collected automatically for that host.\n\nTo start collecting default metrics, you must configure a Monitoring agent per environment that you want to monitor.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-collect-metrics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09685-5899-7847","score":10.987156,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Collecting metrics](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-collect-metrics).\n\n\n\n\n\n Sending metrics \n\nYou can send metrics via the public or the private endpoints by using the appropriate ingestion URL. Details can be found in the [endpoints](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-endpointsendpoints) section.\n\n\n\n\n\n Viewing metrics \n\nYou can monitor and manage metrics through the Monitoring Web UI. For more information, see [Viewing metrics](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-monitoring).\n\nNotice that there is a delay showing metric data for new time series. Data is not ready until the initial indexing of a new metric source is completed. Therefore, new sources such as clusters, platform metrics, or systems that you configure, all take some time to become visible through the Monitoring UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sending notifications \n\nYou can configure single alerts and multi-condition alerts to notify about problems that may require attention. When an alert is triggered, you can be notified through 1 or more notification channels. An alert definition can generate multi-channel notifications.\n\nAn alert is a notification event that you can use to warn about situations that require attention. Each alert has a severity status. This status informs you about the criticality of the information it reports on.\n\nFor example, you can set up Monitoring to send alert notifications to IBM Cloud Event Notifications.\n\n\n\n* [Sending email notifications to IBM Cloud Event Notifications](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-tutorial)\n* [Sending SMS notifications to IBM Cloud Event Notifications](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-tutorial-en-sms)\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Working with alerts and events](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-alerts).\n\n\n\n\n\n Data location \n\nMetric data is hosted on the IBM Cloud.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-monitor"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16490-7-2216","score":10.744156,"text":"\nAnalyzing machine learning model performance \n\nReview the annotations that were added by the trained model to determine whether any adjustments must be made to the model to improve its ability to find valid entity mentions, relation mentions, and coreferences in the documents.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nYou can analyze performance by viewing a summary of statistics for entity types, relation types, and coreferenced mentions. You can also analyze statistics that are presented in a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix helps you compare the annotations added by the machine learning model to the annotations in ground truth.\n\nThe model statistics provide the following metrics:\n\n\n\n* F1 score\n\nA measurement that considers both precision and recall to compute the score. The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall values, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst value at 0. See [Analyzing low F1 scores](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-mlevaluate-mllowf1).\n* Precision\n\nA measurement that specifies what fraction of the machine learning model's output was accurate when compared to the human annotator output. Precision is determined by the number of correctly labeled annotations divided by the total number of annotations added by the machine learning model. A precision score of 1.0 for entity type A means that every mention that was labeled as entity type A does indeed belong to that classification. A low precision score helps you identify places where the machine learning model created incorrect annotations. The score says nothing about how many other mentions that were labeled as entity type A by the human annotator were missed by the machine learning model; the recall score reflects that information. See [Analyzing low precision scores](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-mlevaluate-mllowp).\n* Recall\n\nA measurement that specifies how many mentions that should have been annotated by a given label were actually annotated with that label - the right mentions being those that human annotators identified in the same documents.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-ml"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

If you identify the user interaction with a session_id, then it counts as three uses (because there is a separate session that is created for each interaction).\n\nDesign any custom applications to capture a unique user_id or session_id and pass the information to Watson Assistant. Choose a non-human-identifiable ID that doesn't change throughout the customer lifecycle. For example, don't use a person's email address as the user ID. In fact, the user_id syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7230section-3.2).\n\nThe built-in integrations derive the user ID in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* For Facebook integrations, the user_id property is set to the sender ID that Facebook provides in its payload.\n* For Slack integrations, the user_id property is a concatenation of the team ID, such as T09LVDR7Y, and the member ID of the user, such has W4F8K9JNF. For example: T09LVDR7YW4F8K9JNF.\n* For web chat, you can set the value of the user_id property.\n\n\n\nBilling is managed per monthly active user per service instance. If a single user interacts with assistants that are hosted by different service instances that belong to the same plan, each interaction is treated as a separate use.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-admin-managing-plan"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03028-1501-3230","score":11.903383,"text":"\nYou can filter messages by Search user statements, Intents, Entities, and Last n days.\n\nSearch user statements - Type a word in the search bar.

Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts.

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word \u201cimmutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption. When enable and two backup infrastructure components need to communicate, a dynamic key is generated by the backup server and communicated to each node over a secure channel.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-cr-sa-lhr"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04939-64122-65726","score":7.201092,"text":"\nSystem.out.printf(\"New retention period on %s is %sn\", objectName, additionalSeconds);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n List legal holds on a protected object \n\nThis operation returns:\n\n\n\n* Object creation date\n* Object retention period in seconds\n* Calculated retention expiration date based on the period and creation date\n* List of legal holds\n* Legal hold identifier\n* Timestamp when legal hold was applied\n\n\n\nIf there are no legal holds on the object, an empty LegalHoldSet is returned.

Minimum, maximum and default retention period are defined by this policy and apply to all objects in the bucket.\n\nMinimum retention period is the minimum duration of time an object must be kept unmodified in the bucket.\n\nMaximum retention period is the maximum duration of time an object can be kept unmodified in the bucket.\n\nIf an object is stored in the bucket without specifying a custom retention period, the default retention period is used. The minimum retention period must be less than or equal to the default retention period, which in turn must be less than or equal to the maximum retention period.\n\nA maximum retention period of 1000 years can be specified for the objects.\n\nTo create a retention policy on a bucket, you need Manager role.

An example is an incomplete legal review, where records might need to be accessible for an extended duration beyond the retention period originally set. A legal hold flag can then be applied at the object level. Legal holds can be applied to objects during initial uploads or after an object is written.

Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission\/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission\/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared\/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ac-2"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.2640681226,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2640681226}}

With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount.

After your subscription expires, your account is converted to a Pay-As-You-Go account, which means you pay only for billable services that you use with no contracts or commitments.

While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run. As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.\n\nThe flip side of the same coin is the operational aspect: IBM Cloudant\u2019s operations team relies on replication, too, to move around accounts. By keeping down the number of databases, you help us help you if you need to shift your account from one location to another.\n\nSo when must you use a single database and distinguish between different document types by using views, and when must you use multiple databases to model your data? IBM Cloudant can\u2019t federate views across multiple databases. If you have unrelated data that can never be \u201cjoined\u201d or queried together, then that data can be a candidate for splitting across multiple databases.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set (like a log, sensor readings, or other types of time-series), it\u2019s also not a good idea to create a single, ever-growing, massive database. This kind of use case requires time-boxing, which we cover in more detail later.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid the database per user anti-pattern like the plague \n\nIf you\u2019re building a multi-user service atop IBM Cloudant, it is tempting to allow each user store their data in a separate database under the application account. That works well, mostly, if the number of users is small.\n\nNow add the need to derive cross-user analytics. The way that you do that is to replicate all the user databases into a single analytics database. All good. This app has suddenly become successful, and the number of users grew in the range of 150 - 20,000. You have 20,000 replications just to keep the analytics database current. If you also want to run in an active-active disaster recovery setup, add another 20,000 replications, and the system stops functioning.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1059561-1061582","score":22.913126,"text":"\nThese options include the use of time-based one-time passcode authentication, security questions, third-party authentication mechanisms, and password expiration rules.

If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise.

This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise.

Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions. A common table expression permits defining a result table with a table name that can be specified as a table name in any FROM clause of the fullselect that follows.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16353-2640-4846","score":13.781716,"text":"\nYou can select any step that precedes the step you are editing.\n\nNote that only the selected steps will repeat, regardless of their And then settings. Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3.

This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it.

For more information, see [COS URI](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceCOSURI).\n\nBy default, if the format of the input data is JSON, each line must contain a separate, self-contained, and valid JSON object, also called newline-delimited JSON. However, if you specify the option MULTILINE, Data Engine can process JSON input data even if individual data records span multiple lines, such as when the data was formatted to make it easier to read. Specify this option only if you really need it because it limits input parallelization and can significantly reduce performance when you process large volumes of JSON data. If you need to frequently query large amounts of multiline JSON data, use Data Engine to transform the data into single -line JSON, or into a more performance optimized format, such as Parquet, before querying the transformed data.\n\nIf the file format is Parquet, with the optional MERGE SCHEMA clause you can handle Parquet schema evolution by specifying to scan all qualifying Parquet objects for their schema, and to merge the final schema across all objects. By default, for Parquet input only the first Parquet object that is found is used to infer the schema, which guarantees minimal overhead for compiling the SQL. Thus, use this option if your Parquet input data does not have a homogeneous schema.\n\nIf the object type identifier TEXT is used, the input is read line by line without inferring any schema.

By default, for Parquet input only the first Parquet object that is found is used to infer the schema, which guarantees minimal overhead for compiling the SQL. Thus, use this option if your Parquet input data does not have a homogeneous schema.\n\nIf the object type identifier TEXT is used, the input is read line by line without inferring any schema. The whole line is returned in one column, called value. To query specific fields from the input data, you can use the options [regexp_extract](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sqlfunctionsregexp_extract) or [get_json_object](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sqlfunctionsget_json_object).\n\n\n\n\n\n timeSeriesProperties","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13463-1628-3724","score":25.263828,"text":"\nIf you use IAM, ensure that the user ID that you use to submit the SQL query through the web console or the API is authorized to read the input locations (referenced in the FROM clauses of the query), and to write the result set to the target location (referenced in the INTO clause of the query).

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. It also has some powerful counting aggregations suitable for drill-down user interfaces.\n\nIBM Cloudant Search also powers type=text IBM Cloudant Query indexes, so a subset of its capabilities is surfaced by using the _find API.\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Under the hood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Under the hood video \n\nLearn how the IBM Cloudant service is organized.\n\n\n\n* Under the hood video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 17 - Under the hood.\n\nLet's look at how an IBM Cloudant service is organized: This overview applies to the IBM Cloudant services that map to CouchDB 2 and 3. CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00512-5160-7348","score":20.91293,"text":"\nSee also a brief overview of the underlying querying mechanism that you use to select the query mechanism that is best for each query your application needs to make.\n\n\n\n Global querying \n\nYou can make global queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a global query, the database must perform a scatter-gather operation across all data in the database. This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13490-941-2651","score":20.440897,"text":"\nUse the Data Engine user interface (UI) to [develop your queries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-running) and the [Data EngineREST API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overviewrestapi) to automate them.\n\n\n\n Input and output of queries \n\nBefore you can use the Data Engine service to run SQL queries, the input data must be uploaded to one or more Cloud Object Storage instances.

We recommend that you use the _explain mechanism to check each IBM Cloudant query to ensure it is using an index before you deploy to production.\n\nFor example, a type=json index on firstname, surname and date is suitable for finding documents for:\n\n\n\n* A known firstname, lastname, and date.\n* A known firstname, lastname, and a range of date values (that use $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte operators).\n* A known firstname and lastname sorted by date.\n\n\n\nIt can also be used to assist queries on firstname, surname, date, and other attributes.

For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor.

To protect your app, you must protect the image and establish checks to ensure the image's integrity.\n\nShould I use a public or a private registry to store my images?\n: Public registries, such as Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker images and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.6,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3319039903}}

These operators allow you to provision and manage File, Block, and Object storage for your containerized workloads in Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae clusters. Unlike other storage solutions where you might need to configure separate drivers and operators for each type of storage, ODF is a unified solution capable of adapting or scaling to your storage needs. You can also deploy ODF on any OCP cluster.\n\nHow does OpenShift Data Foundation work?\n: ODF uses storage volumes in multiples of 3 and replicates your app data across these volumes. The underlying storage volumes that you use for ODF depends on your cluster type. - For VPC clusters the storage volumes are dynamically provisioned Block Storage for VPC devices. - For bare metal Classic clusters, the storage volumes are local disks on your bare metal worker nodes. - For Satellite clusters, the storage volumes are either local disks on your worker nodes, or you can dynamically provision disks by using a compatible block storage driver.\n: ODF uses these devices to create a virtualized storage layer, where your app data is replicated for high availability. Because ODF abstracts your underlying storage, you can use ODF to create File, Block, or Object storage claims from the same underlying raw block storage.\n\nFor a full overview of the features and benefits, see [OpenShift Data Foundation](https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/technologies\/cloud-computing\/openshift-data-foundation).\n\n\n\n Architecture overview","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-ocs-storage-prep"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14682-1497-3767","score":23.617943,"text":"\n[IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions and Red Hat OpenShift](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/5bdb37c0149145723c5437e8176651928565e722\/vmwaresolutions\/images\/openshift-sddc.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

These operators allow you to provision and manage File, Block, and Object storage for your containerized workloads in Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae clusters. Unlike other storage solutions where you might need to configure separate drivers and operators for each type of storage, ODF is a unified solution capable of adapting or scaling to your storage needs. You can also deploy ODF on any OCP cluster.\n\nHow does OpenShift Data Foundation work?\n: ODF uses storage volumes in multiples of 3 and replicates your app data across these volumes. The underlying storage volumes that you use for ODF depends on your cluster type. - For VPC clusters the storage volumes are dynamically provisioned Block Storage for VPC devices. - For bare metal Classic clusters, the storage volumes are local disks on your bare metal worker nodes. - For Satellite clusters, the storage volumes are either local disks on your worker nodes, or you can dynamically provision disks by using a compatible block storage driver.\n: ODF uses these devices to create a virtualized storage layer, where your app data is replicated for high availability. Because ODF abstracts your underlying storage, you can use ODF to create File, Block, or Object storage claims from the same underlying raw block storage.\n\nFor a full overview of the features and benefits, see [OpenShift Data Foundation](https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/technologies\/cloud-computing\/openshift-data-foundation).\n\n\n\n Architecture overview","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-ocs-storage-prep"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14009-4636-6811","score":19.39859,"text":"\nWhen new data is written to the volume or LUN, any inaccessible data that still exists is overwritten.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I use a Red Hat Cloud Access subscription to create a virtual server? \n\nYes. When you import an image, you can specify that you provide the operating system license. For more information, see [Use Red Hat Cloud Access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/image-templates?topic=image-templates-using-your-own-os-license-or-subscription). Then, you can order a virtual server from that image template and use your existing [Red Hat Cloud Access](https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/technologies\/cloud-computing\/cloud-access) subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the difference between a virtual server and a virtual private server (VPS)? \n\nA virtual server is similar to the virtual private server (VPS) or virtual dedicated server (VDS) platforms that you might already be familiar with. These \"virtual server\" environments allow for distinct environments to be provisioned privately and securely on a single hardware node, but VDS and VPS are more limited in their capabilities. VPS and VDS options are generally confined to a single-server architecture. The only resources that can be added or divided up between each virtual server on a VDS or VPS are the resources that are physically installed on that single server.\n\nVirtual servers are provisioned on a multi-server cloud architecture that pools all available hardware resources for individual instances to use. Virtual servers can use a shared high-capacity SAN-based primary storage platform or high-performance local disk storage. Because each instance is part of the larger cloud environment, communication between all virtual servers is instantaneous.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why do I receive a capacity error when I provision a virtual server? \n\nWhen you provision a virtual server, you might receive an insufficient capacity to complete the request error. When provisioning fails, all the virtual server instances within that particular request fail. A capacity error occurs when the data center or router has insufficient resources to fulfill the service request. Resource availability changes frequently, so you might wait and try again later.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-faqs-virtual-servers"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.3333333333,"recall_10":0.3333333333,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_10":0.469278726}}

This operator deploys instances of the certificate authority (CA), peer, ordering nodes and the IBM Blockchain Platform console that uses to manage the blockchain components on your network. This deployment option is available for OpenShift clusters that are running in IBM Cloud or your cloud.\n\n\n\n What is Red Hat Marketplace? \n\nRed Hat Marketplace is available directly from your OpenShift web console. It provides an open cloud catalog that makes it easier to discover and access certified software for container-based environments in public clouds. With automated deployment, software is immediately available to deploy on any Red Hat OpenShift cluster, providing a fast, integrated experience. Discover and buy certified software, and quickly deploy. Access open source and proprietary software, with responsive support, streamlined billing and contracting, simplified governance, and single-dashboard visibility across clouds. Built in partnership by Red Hat and IBM, this marketplace helps organizations deliver enterprise software and improve workload portability.\n\nRed Hat Marketplace provides a simplified alternative method for deploying an instance of the IBM Blockchain Platform to your cluster instead of the [manual deployment steps](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain-sw-254?topic=blockchain-sw-254-deploy-ocp) or by using [Ansible playbook](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain-sw-254?topic=blockchain-sw-254-ansible) scripts.\n\nWith just a few simple steps, you can get started with the IBM Blockchain Platform. After you install the operator to your OpenShift project, you can create a subscription that allows you to deploy the blockchain console UI.\n\nCurrently, you cannot deploy certificate authorities (CAs), peers, and ordering nodes directly, then, use the console to deploy those nodes instead. This tutorial includes only instructions for installing the console.\n\nTo learn more about the Marketplace see the [Red Hat documentation](https:\/\/marketplace.redhat.com).\n\n\n\n\n\n Limitations","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-deploy-ocp-rhm"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14490-7-2135","score":25.450077,"text":"\nManaging Red Hat OpenShift for VMware \n\nReview the following information to manage your Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae for VMware\u00ae service after deployment.\n\n\n\n Rotating the Red Hat OpenShift certificates (required) \n\nRed Hat OpenShift for VMware uses kubelet client certificates that must be rotated periodically for security purposes. Red Hat OpenShift mainly automates the rotation process, but requires manual approval of certificate signing requests (CSRs). Therefore, it is important that you understand the Red Hat OpenShift certificate rotation schedule to avoid expired certificates.\n\nThe initial certificates that are created during installation expire 24 hours after they are created. IBM's automation process, which installs Red Hat OpenShift, handles the approval of the CSRs for this initial rotation, which is done by running a script on the bastion for the first 30 hours. The script is named \/root\/approve-csr.sh and its log file is named \/root\/approve-csr.log.\n\nFor the script to run successfully, the initial kubeadmin credentials must be the same until the initial certificate rotation is complete. Do not change the kubeadmin credentials for the first 24 hours. If the credentials are changed, you must monitor and approve the CSRs for the initial certificate rotation. For more information, see [Approving the CSRs for your machines](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.7\/installing\/installing_vsphere\/installing-vsphere.htmlinstallation-approve-csrs_installing-vsphere).\n\nDo not restart any of the Red Hat OpenShift cluster virtual machines (VMs) or the bastion VM until the first certificate rotation is done.\n\nAfter the initial certificate rotation, certificates are renewed every 30 days. You must establish a process to approve the CSRs for every certificate rotation. According to Red Hat\u00ae, you can approve CSRs when they reach 80% of their expiration period, which is approximately 25 days into the lifespan of the CSRs.\n\nIf you do not approve CSRs in time and the certificates expire, you can recover from expired control plane certificates and get the Red Hat OpenShift cluster operational again.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-ocp_managing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06835-7-1819","score":25.264006,"text":"\nDeploying your application on a target \n\nYou can deploy your application on one of three targets: single cluster, multiple clusters, or a custom target.\n\n\n\n Deploying to a single cluster \n\nYou can select Single Cluster as the deployment target when you want to deploy your application on Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud.\n\nDevSecOpsprovides scripts to deploy your application on the cluster.

Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16250-3559-5929","score":16.975285,"text":"\nA failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active\/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active\/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16321-20604-22275","score":16.70853,"text":"\n\"message\": \"Sorry, I could not find an agent.\"\n},\n\"message_to_human_agent\": \"The caller needs help resetting their password\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Transferring upon failure \n\nTo configure transfer on failures, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings.

If User-to-User is specified in the transfer_headers list, the session history key is sent in the X-Watson-Assistant-Session-History-Key header.\n\nThe value of the SIP header is limited to 1024 bytes.\n\nHow this data is presented in the SIP REFER message also depends on the value of transfer_headers_send_method(as defined in [Generic Service Desk SIP Parameters](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsgeneric-service-desk-sip-parameters)).\n\nThe following example shows the data included as headers:\n\nREFER sip:b@atlanta.example.com SIP\/2.0\nVia: SIP\/2.0\/UDP agenta.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK2293940223\nTo: <sip:b@atlanta.example.com>\nFrom: <sip:a@atlanta.example.com>;tag=193402342\nCall-ID: 898234234@agenta.atlanta.example.com\nCSeq: 23 REFER\nMax-Forwards: 7\nRefer-To: sip:user@domain.com","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03312-3639-6036","score":16.513256,"text":"\nA Watson Assistant phone integration in one region is unaware of a phone integration in a different region.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3562071871}}

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12717-7818-8740","score":14.29217,"text":"\nCheck whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code CM-3(2)(0), CM-4(0), CM-4(1)(0), CM-7(1)(a), CM-7(b), RA-5(1)(0), RA-5(2)(0), RA-5(3)(0), RA-5(a), RA-5(b), RA-5(c), RA-5(d), SA-10(e), SA-15(a), SA-3(a), SA-3(d), SA-8(0), SI-10(0), SI-2(2)(0), SI-2(a), SI-2(b), SI-2(c), and SI-2(d) Rule was added \n Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts CM-3(2)(0), CM-4(0), CM-4(1)(0), CM-7(1)(a), CM-7(b), RA-5(1)(0), RA-5(2)(0), RA-5(3)(0), RA-5(a), RA-5(b), RA-5(c), RA-5(d), SA-10(e), SA-15(a), SA-3(a), SA-3(d), SA-8(0), SI-10(0), SI-2(2)(0), SI-2(a), SI-2(b), SI-2(c), and SI-2(d) Rule was added \n Check whether Secrets Manager arbitrary secrets are rotated at least every # days IA-5(g) Rule was added \n Check whether Secrets Manager user credentials are rotated at least every # days IA-5(g) Rule was added","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-fs-change-log"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12493-27359-28981","score":14.211363,"text":"\nPrerequisites \n\nYou need the [Writer service role](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam) to rotate secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Command options \n\npayload\n: The new data to store for an arbitrary secret.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":19.888796,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":14.373378,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

If no monitors are attached to the load balancer, it directs traffic to the primary pool exclusively.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dynamic steering \n\nDynamic steering uses health check data to identify the fastest pool for a CIS region or point of presence (PoP).\n\nDynamic steering creates Round Trip Time (RTT) profiles based on an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) of RTT to determine the fastest pool. If there is no current RTT data for your pool in a region or colocation center, CIS directs traffic to the pools in failover order.\n\nAllow 10 minutes for CIS to build an RTT profile the first time you enable dynamic steering for a server pool.\n\nIf you are terminating TCP at a cloud provider edge location, the calculated latency might not reflect the true latency to the origin for TCP health checks.\n\nThe following diagram shows how CIS routes traffic to the pool with the lowest EWMA among three regions: Eastern North America, Europe, and Australia. In this case, the ENAM pool is selected, because it has the lowest RTT.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing traffic steering](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/cb1eb27836421578019401fa7556779109430b29\/cis\/images\/cis-traffic-steering.svg)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-traffic-steering"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04107-6095-8145","score":16.45175,"text":"\nThis tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again.

These attacks send malicious ISO Layer-7 requests (the application layer), such as GET floods. \n Automatically blocked at CIS edge CIS handles these attacks with Defense mode, WAF, and security-level settings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n On-demand anti-DDoS \n\nIBM Cloud Internet Services ingests traffic by returning a CIS IP address on the DNS lookup for a domain, instead of the actual record for the origin server\u2019s IP address.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04179-7-1888","score":16.186287,"text":"\nManaging CIS for optimal security \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services (CIS) security settings include safe defaults designed to avoid false positives and negative influence on your traffic.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com. This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-ibm-cis-for-optimal-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04137-1660-3678","score":16.184772,"text":"\nTo eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).\n\n\n\n\n\n Root record CNAME flattening \n\nIBM CIS supports a feature called \"CNAME Flattening.\" Using this method, root records can overcome the IETF RFC restriction that if a root record is a CNAME, it cannot have any other records for that domain. CIS Authoritative servers overcome this restriction by returning the A records corresponding to the CNAME target instead of returning the CNAME itself, effectively hiding the CNAME. This technique allows other records such as MX records to be added to the domain, even though the root record is a CNAME.\n\n\n\n\n\n Proxying DNS records and global load balancers \n\nIBM CIS supports proxying for global load balancers and DNS records. When a record or load balancer is proxied, it means that its traffic runs directly through CIS.\n\nCurrently, DNS records of type A, AAAA, or CNAME can be proxied.\n\n\n\n Setting proxy modes \n\nLoad balancers and DNS records support both DNS-only and HTTP proxy modes. You can have HTTP proxy and DNS-only domains in the same CIS instance, but the traffic routing behavior differs as follows:\n\n\n\n* Traffic for records that are proxied flows through CIS.\n* Traffic for records that are non-proxied (DNS-only mode) flows directly from the client to the origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n HTTP proxy mode \n\nIn HTTP proxy mode, CIS announces IBM IP addresses externally, but protects (mask) your origin server IP addresses.

A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

They must assess the applicability of the type system changes.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nThis process propagates the current type system, ground truth editor keyboard shortcuts, and color settings to all document sets in a task.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo modify the type system without losing the work that was done by human annotators:\n\n\n\n1. Change the type system. For example, you can add or remove entity types or relation types.\n2. Decide whether you want to propagate the changes to existing human annotation tasks.\n3. Open the Machine Learning Model > Annotations page and click the Annotation Tasks tab. Open each task that you want to update and click Apply Type System Updates.\n\nIf you removed entity types or relation types from the type system, all occurrences of those types are highlighted in gray in the documents. These invalid types are ignored by the machine learning model. They do not prevent you from submitting and approving document sets.\n4. Provide details to the human annotators about what changed in the type system.\n5. Ask human annotators to update their documents to reflect the changes in the type system. For example, if you added new entity types or relation types, they must review their documents and annotate them appropriately.\n\n> Note: If the task contains completed documents, human annotators cannot alter those documents to assess type system changes until they are back in an editable state. To become editable, ask human annotators to submit the document sets so that you can reject them.\n\n\n\nRelated concepts:\n\n[Type systems](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-typesystemwks_typesystem)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Document set management","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-improve-ml"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":18.674006,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03109-10370-12635","score":15.315662,"text":"\nWhen the web chat widget is being interacted with by a user, we track the features that are being used, and events such as how many times the widget is opened and how many users start conversations.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1218119-1220168","score":18.563086,"text":"\nThere are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

A VPC is your own, private cloud on shared cloud infrastructure with logical isolation from other virtual networks.\n\nA subnet is an IP address range.

For the purposes of VPC, the important characteristic of a subnet is the fact that subnets can be isolated from one another, as well as being interconnected in the usual way. Subnet isolation can be accomplished by Security Groups that act as firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic for one or more virtual server instances.\n\nA good practice is to have a subnet used for resources that must be exposed to the outside world. Resources with restricted access that should never be directly accessed from the outside world are placed within a different subnet.

Microsoft has had a specific set of rules that customers should follow when using their licenses on cloud providers from 2019. On August 29th, 2022 Microsoft changed their policy with two announcements. The first customer [announcement](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/licensing\/news\/options-for-hosted-cloud) states that Microsoft BYOL can be deployed on shared (multi-tenant hosts). Previously this was limited to dedicated (single-tenant) hosts. Customers should read and understand the new terms and conditions in the [Microsoft FAQ](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/licensing\/news\/new-software-assurance-benefit-to-support-hosting-from-third-party-providers). The [blog](https:\/\/blogs.partner.microsoft.com\/mpn\/new-licensing-benefits-make-bringing-workloads-and-licenses-to-partners-clouds-easier\/) posting on BYOL provides more detailed information and Microsoft also has a [training video](https:\/\/licensingschool.eventbuilder.com\/hostingcustomer). Basically, when a customer uses BYOL, they will be able to license Windows Server by virtual core instead of physical cores and on public multi-tenant instances.\n\nCustomers should review these revised rules and their current spending and usage patterns to determine which deployment model makes the most financial and technical performance sense. Some workloads are steady state and require consistent infrastructure and some workloads are bursty and can be cycled on and off to take advantage of hourly pricing.\n\nDepending on the IBM Cloud solution, Microsoft software is purchased pay-as-you-go (hourly, monthly, yearly) on shared or dedicated resources. For BYOL, as of October 19th 2022, you can provision BYOL Microsoft licenses on dedicated and shared hosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/microsoft?topic=microsoft-microsoft-byol"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05707-4888-6797","score":15.323476,"text":"\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service on IBM Cloud Public delivers powerful tools by combining Docker containers, the Kubernetes technology, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security and isolation to automate the deployment, operation, scaling, and monitoring of containerized apps in a cluster of compute hosts For more information, see [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service technology](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n: You can also create your cluster in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which gives you the security of a private cloud environment with isolated networking features along with the dynamic scalability of the public cloud.

Cloud Functions applications use compute capacity and billed only when they are serving user requests. Idle standby or waiting mode is nonexistent. This feature makes Cloud Functions considerably less expensive when compared to traditional containers or Cloud Foundry applications. Both of those tools have idle time, waiting for inbound user requests, and you are billed for all that \u201csleeping\u201d time.\n\nFull web application can be built and run with Cloud Functions. Combining serverless APIs with static file hosting for site resources such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, means that you can build entirely serverless web applications.

Since Cloud Functions is hosted on IBM Cloud, it is a great benefit when compared to standing up, and operating a Node.js Express or other traditional server runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n IoT \n\nInternet of Things scenarios are often inherently sensor-driven. For example, an action in Cloud Functions might be triggered if a need to react to a sensor that exceeds a specific temperature. IoT interactions are usually stateless with the potential of high load in major spontaneous events such as natural disasters, significant weather storms, or traffic jams. A need is created for an elastic system where normal workload might be small, but needs to scale quickly with predictable response time. So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04145-7-2180","score":17.02872,"text":"\nFAQs for IBM Cloud Internet Services \n\nHave a question about IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services?

If a zone is deleted, another zone or the same zone cannot be added during the Free Trial Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n How many Free Trial instances can I have? \n\nYou can have, at most, one Free Trial instance per account, for the lifetime of the account. If you already have a free trial instance, if you delete a free trial instance, or if the free trial expires, you are not allowed to create another free trial instance. You can, however, create instances of other paid plan types (for example, Standard), independent of any free trials you might have created.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I downgrade from Standard to the Free Trial? \n\nNo. Downgrading from Standard to a Free Trial plan is not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n My Free Trial has expired. What are my options? \n\nTo avoid any data loss you must upgrade from Free Trial to Standard prior to the expiration date. After that, we only support upgrading the Plan or Deleting the CIS instance. If the instance is not deleted or upgraded after 45 days (from the initiation of the instance) the configuration domain, global load balancers, pools, and health checks are deleted automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n What happened to Enterprise Package plans? \n\nStarting on 21 June 2023, you can no longer configure the Enterprise package plan. The functionality of this plan was split across various tiers and are now available in Enterprise Essential, Enterprise Advanced, and Enterprise Premier plans. See [Transition to Enterprise](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-transitioning-next-plan).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I delete my CIS instance? \n\nTo delete a CIS instance, you must first delete all global load balancers, pools, and health checks. Then delete the associated domain (zone).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03648-0-496","score":16.750767,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  VMware and IBM Cloud \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae provides the unique capability for you to provision dedicated Bare Metal Servers upon which you can deploy your own VMware based private cloud.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-3313-5682","score":15.976576,"text":"\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period.

No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

Just by using a managed service like Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae, you are saving many expenses that are associated with managing, updating, and maintaining an infrastructure environment.\n\n\n\n Understanding costs by component \n\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters, you can use IBM Cloud infrastructure compute, networking, and storage resources with platform services such as Watson AI or Compose Database-as-a-Service. Each resource might entail its own charges that can be [fixed, metered, tiered, or reserved](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-chargescharges) and billed by various incremental rates such as monthly or hourly.\n\nMonthly resources are billed based on the first of the month for usage in the preceding month. If you order a monthly resource in the middle of the month, you are charged a prorated amount for that month. However, if you cancel a resource in the middle of the month, you are still charged the full amount for the monthly resource.\n\n\n\n Worker nodes \n\nClusters can have two main types of worker nodes: virtual or physical (bare metal) machines. Flavor (machine type) availability and pricing varies by the zone that you deploy your cluster to.\n\nWhen do worker nodes begin to incur charges?**\n: Worker nodes begin to incur charges after they complete the provisioning state and continue until you delete the worker nodes and they complete the deleting state. For more information, see [Worker node states](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-health-monitorstates).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the difference between virtual and physical machines? \n\nVirtual machines feature greater flexibility, quicker provisioning times, and more automatic scalability features than bare metal, at a more cost-effective price than bare-metal.

Charges from platform and classic infrastructure services are included if your account uses both types. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) charges aren't included.\n\n\n\nThird-party services, such as SendGrid, don't bill for their service through IBM Cloud if you signed up for their service outside of IBM Cloud.\n\nAn IBM Cloud service might provide a free allocation before the start of your billing period. To determine whether your service instance provides a free allocation, go to the [Resources list](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/resources) in the IBM Cloud console. Click the service name, and then click Plan. Review the feature description for each plan to see whether the service offers free allocations. Free allocations are applied to the account level and not the organization level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-understand-invoices"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.75,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.530721274,"ndcg_cut_5":0.592512032,"ndcg_cut_10":0.7226387153}}

Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for example, when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations also identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational information systems without identification and authentication and thus, the values for assignment statements can be none.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ac-14"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12574-2970-5228","score":14.573945,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Enabling authentication from an external identity provider](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-idp-integration).\n\nBoth federation options require that the user is a member of the account, or has access to the account by a trusted profile to be able to complete operations. If trusted profiles are not configured, the account owner or administrator must invite individual IBMids into the IBM Cloud account. Only if the invited IBMid accepts the invitation is the user added the account as an active user. In the case of App ID, the user is automatically onboarded to IBM Cloud without a need to invite each user to the account. In both types of federation, the users are active IBM Cloud account users that can access the platform, including IAM-enabled resources and classic infrastructure all depending on their assigned access.\n\nTrusted profiles deal with federated users differently. If the customer federates their corporate IdP, users from that IdP aren't added to an account as what we might consider a typical user. Instead, users' SAML-based IdP attributes are evaluated at login and if they meet all of the conditions for a trusted profile, they are prompted to apply one or more trusted profiles. Trusted profiles grant users the level of access that they need to complete specialized and specific tasks in a limited time-period, for example, 1 - 4 hours. Time-based access allows frequent authentication checks for reduced security risks. These are usually critical tasks that you would want to avoid doing unintentionally in daily work. Users don't need to onboard to IBM Cloud, they're automatically added through the trust relationship. If a user leaves your company, you can delete the user's corporate identity in your directory, which revokes access to IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n Functional IDs \n\nFunctional IDs are most commonly used when an application or service needs a digital identity and access to IAM-enabled resources or classic infrastructure resources. Some services require a functional ID when you create service instances, for example the Kubernetes Service.\n\nA functional ID is a type of user ID that exists in your Identity Provider's (IdP) user directory, but it's not tied to a specific user.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-identity-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02734-7-2170","score":14.52554,"text":"\nAnonymous authentication \n\nWith IBM Cloud\u00ae App ID, you can allow users to anonymously browse your application under an anonymous user profile. If the user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to still access their anonymous attributes by attaching their anonymous profile to their user identity with App ID.\n\n\n\n Understanding progressive authentication \n\nWhen a user chooses not to sign in immediately, they are considered an anonymous user. For example, say you're an online retailer and you want to allow users to add objects to their shopping cart without signing in. However, you ask them to sign in to complete their purchase. If a user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to access the same objects that were in their shopping carts before they signed in.\n\nYou can use App ID to gather information about anonymous users into an anonymous user profile, which you can use to help personalize their experience of your application. If the user chooses to signs in, you can attach the user attributes that are part of the anonymous profile to their user identity that is stored in App ID. Anonymous profiles are temporarily valid. While you develop your app, you can [configure the lifetime](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-managing-idpidp-token-lifetime) of anonymous tokens.\n\nWhen a user signs in, they become an identified user. If an existing identified user profile does not exist, you can create a new identified user profile. After a user is identified, App ID issues new access and identity tokens and their anonymous token becomes invalid. However, an identified user can still access the attributes of their anonymous profile because they are accessible with the new access and identity tokens.\n\nYou can attach the attributes of only one anonymous profile to the user's identity that is stored in App ID. For example, say that a user browses your application anonymously in two separate browser tabs. The user adds a t-shirt to the shopping cart on the first tab and a pair of shorts to the cart on the second tab. App ID creates two separate anonymous profiles to track the interactions of the user with your application on each tab.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-anonymous"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.2371977128,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2371977128}}

It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. The name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03334-5529-7605","score":14.717683,"text":"\n* Both training and test data (for evaluation purposes) should reflect the distribution of intents in real usage.

Generally, the more coverage for various patterns, the better the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How entity references are treated \n\nWhen you include an entity mention in a user example, the machine learning model uses the information in different ways in these scenarios:\n\n\n\n* [Referencing entity values and synonyms in intent examples](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intentsintents-related-entities)\n* [Annotated mentions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intentsintents-annotated-mentions)\n* [Directly referencing an entity name in an intent example](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intentsintents-entity-as-example)\n\n\n\n\n\n Referencing entity values and synonyms in intent examples \n\nIf you have defined, or plan to define, entities that are related to this intent, mention the entity values or synonyms in some of the examples. Doing so helps to establish a relationship between the intent and entities. It is a weak relationship, but it does inform the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotated mentions \n\nAs you define entities, you can annotate mentions of the entity directly from your existing intent user examples. A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value. And when you add the mention to an existing entity value, it is also added to that entity value as new synonym. Intent classification does use these types of dictionary references in intent user examples to establish a weak reference between an intent and an entity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03334-15077-16547","score":14.253701,"text":"\n* To download all intents, meaning the intents listed on this and any additional pages, do not select any individual intents.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03329-4-1522","score":19.294266,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03120-1659-3917","score":19.17731,"text":"\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.3333333333,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.1356519734}}

It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs used in integrations with channels such as Facebook or Slack skip nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\nFor more information about these built-in nodes, see [Starting and ending the dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-start).\n2. To add more nodes to the dialog tree, click Add node.\n\nYour new node is added after the Welcome node and before the Anything else node.\n3. Add a name to the node.\n\nUse a short, customer-friendly description of what the node does as its name. For example, Open an account, Get policy information, or Get a weather forecast.\n\nThe name can be up to 512 characters in length.\n\nThis node name is shown to customers or service desk personnel to express the purpose of this branch of the dialog, so take some time to add a name that is concise and descriptive.\n4.

The response might be the answer to a question such as What are your store hours? or the execution of a command, such as placing an order. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree.

See [Downloading a skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

You can use the \/dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the \/dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03196-4-2102","score":21.14695,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

From the Skills menu, click Dialog.\n\nThe following nodes are created for you automatically:\n\n\n\n* Welcome: The first node. It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs used in integrations with channels such as Facebook or Slack skip nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\nFor more information about these built-in nodes, see [Starting and ending the dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-start).\n2. To add more nodes to the dialog tree, click Add node.\n\nYour new node is added after the Welcome node and before the Anything else node.\n3. Add a name to the node.\n\nUse a short, customer-friendly description of what the node does as its name. For example, Open an account, Get policy information, or Get a weather forecast.\n\nThe name can be up to 512 characters in length.\n\nThis node name is shown to customers or service desk personnel to express the purpose of this branch of the dialog, so take some time to add a name that is concise and descriptive.\n4. In the If assistant recognizes field, enter a condition that, when met, triggers your assistant to process the node.\n\nTo start off, you typically want to add an intent as the condition.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03069-7-2188","score":19.870718,"text":"\nTutorial: Building a complex dialog \n\nIn this tutorial, you will use the Watson Assistant service to create a dialog for an assistant that helps users with inquiries about a fictitious restaurant called Truck Stop Gourmand.\n\n\n\n Learning objectives \n\nBy the time you finish the tutorial, you will understand how to:\n\n\n\n* Plan a dialog\n* Define custom intents\n* Add dialog nodes that can handle your intents\n* Add entities to make your responses more specific\n* Add a pattern entity, and use it in the dialog to find patterns in user input\n* Set and reference context variables\n\n\n\n\n\n Duration \n\nThis tutorial will take approximately 2 to 3 hours to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n Prerequisite \n\nBefore you begin, complete the [Getting Started tutorial](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-getting-started).\n\nYou will use the dialog skill that you created, and add nodes to the simple dialog that you built as part of the getting started exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Plan the dialog \n\nYou are building an assistant for a restaurant named Truck Stop Gourmand that has one location and a thriving cake-baking business. You want the simple assistant to answer user questions about the restaurant, its menu, and to cancel customer cake orders. Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input. The General_About_You intent that is provided with the General content catalog serves a similar function, but its user examples are designed to focus on queries about the assistant as opposed to the business that is using the assistant to help its customers. So, you will add your own intent.\n\n\n\n Add the about_restaurant intent \n\n\n\n1.

The new system entity version is enabled automatically for dialog skills in the Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages. You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page. This settings page is not displayed in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills because use of the legacy version of the API is no longer supported for those languages.

The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03043-7-2031","score":24.241907,"text":"\nAdding a skill to your assistant \n\nCustomize your assistant by adding to it the skills it needs to satisfy your customers' goals.\n\nYou can create the following types of skills:\n\n\n\n* Dialog skill: Uses Watson natural language processing and machine learning technologies to understand user questions and requests, and respond to them with answers that are authored by you.\n* Search skill: For a given user query, uses the IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to search a data source of your self-service content and return an answer.\n\n\n\nTypically, you create a skill of each type first.

For example, you might use the benchmark in an audit to confirm that basic security measures are in place, and to identify areas where you might enhance your security.\n\n\n\n What does the benchmark cover? \n\nThe benchmark covers recommendations for master components, etcd, control plane configurations, worker nodes, and policies such as for users, network, and pod security.\n\n\n\n\n\n What do the benchmark recommendations mean? \n\nThe benchmark recommendations have scoring, levels, result status, and responsibilities as follows.\n\n\n\n* Scoring\n\n\n\n* Scored: The overall benchmark score increases or decreases depending on whether the recommendation is met.\n* Not scored: The overall benchmark score is not impacted, whether the recommendation is met.\n\n\n\n* Levels\n\n\n\n* Level 1: Practical security measures that can be configured without inhibiting the service.\n* Level 2: More in-depth security measures that might reduce the performance or functionality of a service.\n\n\n\n* Result\n\n\n\n* Pass: The service complies with the benchmark recommendation.\n* Fail: The service does not comply with the benchmark recommendation by default. Refer to the remediation section for an explanation and possible actions that you can take to comply with the benchmark recommendation.\n\n\n\n* Responsibility\n\n\n\n* IBM: IBM is responsible for configuring the setting that the benchmark recommends.\n* Shared: You and IBM share responsibility for configuring the setting that the benchmark recommends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What parts of the benchmark am I responsible for? \n\nBecause IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is a managed offering, IBM already configures many security settings for you. For example, IBM manages and automatically applies updates to your cluster master. For your worker nodes, IBM provides security and version updates, but you must apply the updates. You are also responsible for your workload applications and data.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cis-benchmark"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05618-7-2074","score":26.296228,"text":"\nKubernetes version 1.27 CIS Kubernetes Benchmark \n\nThe Center for Internet Security (CIS) publishes the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https:\/\/www.cisecurity.org\/benchmark\/kubernetes\/) as a framework of specific steps to configure Kubernetes more securely and with standards that are commensurate to various industry regulations.

They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently.

With the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service version](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionscs_versions), you get access to community Kubernetes API features that are considered beta or higher by the community. Kubernetes alpha features, which are subject to change, are generally not enabled by default. With Kubernetes, you can combine various resources such as secrets, deployments, and services to securely create and manage highly available, containerized apps.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift\n: Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is a Kubernetes-based platform that is designed especially to accelerate your containerized app delivery processes that run on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system. You can orchestrate and scale your existing Red Hat OpenShift workloads across on-prem and off-prem clouds for a portable, hybrid solution that works the same in multicloud scenarios.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05727-10686-13084","score":25.30597,"text":"\nThey need a solution that helps the Developers and their users.\n\n\n\n* FRONT-END TO EXISTING BENEFITS: insurance, educational offerings, wellness, and more\n* REGION-SPECIFIC FEATURES: each country has unique HR policies so that the overall site might look similar but show region-specific benefits\n* DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY TOOLS that accelerate rollout of features and bug fixes\n* CHATBOT to provide authentic conversations about benefits and resolve users requests and questions efficiently.\n\n\n\nTechnical solution:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service\n* IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery\n* IBM Logging and Monitoring\n* IBM\u00ae Secure Gateway for IBM Cloud\u00ae\n* IBM Cloud App ID\n\n\n\nAccelerated development is a key win for the HR Exec.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00550-7-2005","score":23.017904,"text":"\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09557-7-2255","score":22.818733,"text":"\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai). Each instance is deployed in a highly available configuration; that is, data is replicated by each database onto one or more servers, making the data highly available during normal operations.\n\n\n\n* In MZRs, database members are distributed across different data centers, or zones.\n* In single-campus multizone regions, database members are distributed across different hosts.\n\n\n\nIf a single-campus multizone region failure in an MZR or a hardware failure in any region occurs, your data is still accessible as it is replicated onto other fully functioning database servers. Such issues are addressed by IBM Cloud\u00ae Specialists in place.\n\nYou can consult your Cloud Databases documentation for more details on how your specific database replicates data among each of its members.\n\nIn addition to the high-availability configuration, for deployments in IBM Cloud Multi-Zone Regions, your data is snapshotted and backed up daily by the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases platform and stored in [cross-region Cloud Object Storage buckets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpointsendpoints-geo).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-25421-27357","score":22.455576,"text":"\nType acurl $URL\/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00510-7123-9213","score":20.09251,"text":"\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate.

While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run. As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-4796-6846","score":19.979185,"text":"\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Capacity metrics\n\n Metric Description \n\n Reads per second The rate when simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its _id, or querying against a partitioned database that uses a partition key. \n Writes per second The rate when data is written to the database. API calls dealing with document creation, update, or deletion count as \"writes\". \n Global Queries per second The rate when the database is queried by global indices, typically by accessing the _find endpoint, secondary MapReduce, or search indices. \n Storage The amount of disk space occupied by your JSON data, attachments, and secondary indices. \n\n\n\nAs an example, the Lite plan offers 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB of storage for free. This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance.

The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted.

The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12904-22084-23929","score":24.394058,"text":"\nAs the result, you're billed an overage charge based on 87 GB x 12 hours = 1044 GB hours for that extra space.\n\nOverage is calculated by using the maximum number of GB more than the plan allocation during a particular hour within the billing cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disk overage example \n\nAssume that you start a month of 30 days with a Standard plan service instance that uses 9 GB of storage.

Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03126-3707-6008","score":22.573929,"text":"\nUnderstanding where you will deploy the assistant before you begin can help you author the right types of answers for a given channel or platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n What languages does your assistant speak? \n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language. For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02839-1790-3940","score":21.781776,"text":"\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

While you develop your skill, you use the Try it out pane to verify that your assistant recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and to make corrections as needed.\n\nFrom the User conversations page, you can analyze actual interactions between the assistant you used to deploy the skill and your users. Based on those interactions, you can make corrections to improve the accuracy with which intents and entities are recognized by your dialog skill.

For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

The following changes were made with this version:\n\n\n\n* The order in which conditions are evaluated in nodes with slots has changed. Previously, if you had a node with slots that allowed for digressions away, the anything_else root node was triggered before any of the slot level Not found conditions could be evaluated. The order of operations has been changed to address this behavior. Now, when a user digresses away from a node with slots, all the root nodes except the anything_else node are processed. Next, the slot level Not found conditions are evaluated. And, finally, the root level anything_else node is processed. To better understand the full order of operations for a node with slots, see [Slot usage tips](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slotsdialog-slots-node-level-handler).\n* Strings that begin with a number sign (#) in the context or output objects of a message are no longer treated as intent references.\n\nPreviously, these strings were treated as intents automatically. For example, if you specified a context variable, such as \"color\":\"FFFFFF\", then the hex color code (FFFFFF) would be treated as an intent. Your assistant would check whether an intent named FFFFFF was detected in the user's input, and if not, would replace FFFFFF with false. This replacement no longer occurs.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03185-4-1963","score":15.485685,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

The response might be the answer to a question such as What are your store hours? or the execution of a command, such as placing an order. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree. Create a branch to process each intent that you want your conversation to handle. A branch is composed of multiple nodes.\n\n\n\n Dialog nodes \n\nEach dialog node contains, at a minimum, a condition and a response.\n\n![Shows user input going to a box that contains the statement If: CONDITION, Then: RESPONSE](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/node1-empty.png)\n\n\n\n* Condition: Specifies the information that must be present in the user input for this node in the dialog to be triggered. The information is typically a specific intent. It might also be an entity type, an entity value, or a context variable value.

The irrelevance detection model helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore. This enhanced model helps your skill recognize irrelevant inputs earlier in the development process.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of the new algorithm, read the [Why Zero-Effort Irrelevance is Relevant](https:\/\/medium.com\/ibm-watson\/enhanced-offtopic-90b2dadf0ef1) blog post.\n\nThe new algorithm is enabled automatically for any English-language skills that you import or create.\n\nTo test the new detection mechanism in the Try it out pane, submit one or more utterances that have absolutely nothing to do with your training data. The new mechanism helps your skill to correctly recognize that the test utterances do not map to any of the intents defined in your training data, and classifies them as being Irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n How irrelevance detection works \n\nThe algorithmic models that help your assistant understand what your users say are built from two key pieces of information:\n\n\n\n* Subjects you want the assistant to address. For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-16079-18117","score":15.332017,"text":"\n: The dialog feature is available in the new Watson Assistant experience.

For example, you can now expect the same confidence score for the following two inputs: ik ben een kleine krijger? and ik ben een kleine krijger. In this example, the question mark (?) doesn't affect the confidence score.\n\nImproved enhanced intent detection\n: The exact match in enhanced intent detection now better handles small differences between training examples and runtime utterances when the differences do not change the meaning of a sentence.\n\nFor example, suppose in your training examples, covid-19 is in the covid intent and @doctortype_facilitytype around Palm Beach is in the find_provide_master intent. In this example, the @doctortype_facilitytype direct entity reference contains entity values, including hospital. At run time, covid19 is predicted as 100% confident for the covid intent, and hospital around palm beach is predicted as 100% confident for the find_provide_master intent.\n\nThis update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server. This capability allows you to decentralize the management of a large domain (such as ibm.com).\n\nA custom domain name server allows you to utilize the DNS provider's servers with the customized reference name of your own domain. For example, you can define your name server to be ns1.cloud.ibm.com instead of ns1.acme.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally 'sign' DNS data so you can be assured it is valid.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server. This capability allows you to decentralize the management of a large domain (such as ibm.com).\n\nA custom domain name server allows you to utilize the DNS provider's servers with the customized reference name of your own domain. For example, you can define your name server to be ns1.cloud.ibm.com instead of ns1.acme.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally 'sign' DNS data so you can be assured it is valid. To eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).\n\n\n\n\n\n Root record CNAME flattening \n\nIBM CIS supports a feature called \"CNAME Flattening.\" Using this method, root records can overcome the IETF RFC restriction that if a root record is a CNAME, it cannot have any other records for that domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-dns-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04149-1398-3431","score":20.847155,"text":"\nSet up your DNS records (optional).\n4.

If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel). When the traffic is split between the VPN interface and other interfaces, split tunneling is said to be in use.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-vpn-planning"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01145-7-1486","score":15.07396,"text":"\nData security and privacy \n\nIBM\u00ae uses the following methods to help ensure the security and privacy of your data.\n\n\n\n Cryptographic protocols \n\n\n\n* Connections are restricted to the following strong cipher suites:\n\n\n\nFor TLS v1.2:\n\n* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\n* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\n* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\n\nFor TLS v1.3:\n\n* TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\n* TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\n* TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\n\n\n\n* To be a fully supported configuration, all clients must support the following:\n\n\n\n* TLS v1.2 or v1.3\n* Elliptic curve cryptography\n* TLS server name indication (SNI)\n\n\n\n* Additionally, you must use TLS v1.2 or v1.3 in the following cases:\n\n\n\n* To make connections to the Kafka native and REST interfaces.\n* The browser that you use to access the Event Streams dashboard must support TLS v1.2 or v1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Encryption of message payloads, topic names, and consumer groups \n\nMessage data is encrypted for transmission between Event Streams and clients as a result of TLS.

Users of the website can be sure that no one else is masquerading as the website. It is done through a public-private key pair.\n\nHyper Protect Crypto Services provides a way to offload the cryptographic operations that are done during the TLS handshake to establish a secure connection to the web server, while it keeps the TLS\/SSL private key securely stored in the dedicated HSM. In this way, you have control over your TLS\/SSL keys and processing. As a result, security is improved and reputational risk is decreased.\n\nTLS\/SSL offloading to the Hyper Protect Crypto Services HSM enables data in transit protection for web, API, and mobile transactions by using the standard PKCS #11 API. With Hyper Protect Crypto Services, you can integrate TLS\/SSL offloading with other cloud proxies.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-uko-use-cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04041-22118-24242","score":13.951678,"text":"\nWhen you have data privacy requirements, [Private Data collections](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.2\/private-data\/private-data.htmlwhat-is-private-data) provide a way to further isolate specific data from the rest of the channel members.

By default, server-side TLS is enabled for all communications using TLS certificates. TLS is used to encrypt the communication between your nodes and between your nodes and your applications. TLS prevents man-in-the-middle and session hijacking attacks. All IBM Blockchain Platform components use TLS to communicate with each other.\n* Transaction integrity: Fabric uses the cryptographic ECDSA standard to guarantee transaction integrity. With ECDSA, the transaction originator, such as a client application, signs their message by using their private key, and the recipient, such as a peer, uses the originator\u2019s public key to verify the authenticity of the message. If a transaction is tampered with on its way to the recipient, the signature verification fails.\n* Channels: While Fabric channels are a powerful mechanism for partitioning and isolating data, they also provide the primary foundation for data privacy. Only members of the same channel can access the data of this channel. To ensure channel security, the channel configuration update policy is configured to define the number of channel operators who need to agree on the channel update request before a channel can be updated. Therefore, a clear process must exist for defining the organizations that are allowed to join and update channel.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14224-5394-7696","score":12.975682,"text":"\nCustomer workload connectivity to public takes place through NSX-T edge routers that are managed by the customer through a restricted VMware Cloud Director interface.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel). When the traffic is split between the VPN interface and other interfaces, split tunneling is said to be in use.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-vpn-planning"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07973-7-1958","score":15.0376835,"text":"\nData encryption in transit \n\nData in transit must always be encrypted.

This document gives some details.\n\n\n\n  What is a Web Application Firewall? \n\nA WAF helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet. A WAF is an OSI protocol Layer-7 defense in the [OSI model](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OSI_model), and it is not designed to defend against all types of attacks.\n\nDeploying a WAF in front of a web application is like placing a shield between the web application and the internet. A proxy server protects a client machine\u2019s identity by using an intermediary (for outgoing traffic), but a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy that protects the server from exposure by having the client's traffic pass through the WAF before reaching the server (for incoming traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Types of attacks WAF can prevent \n\nA WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others. A WAF usually is part of a suite of tools, which together can create a holistic defense against a range of attack vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How a WAF works \n\nA WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic.\n\nThe value of a WAF comes from the speed and ease with which its policy modifications can be implemented, thereby allowing a faster response to varying attack vectors. For example, during a [DDoS attack](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Denial-of-service_attack), rate limiting can be implemented by modifying WAF policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Key benefits of a CIS WAF \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services WAF is an easy way to set up, manage, and customize security rules to protect your web applications from common web threats.

All resources should be protected by identity and access management (IAM). It means, that authentication and authorization checks should be performed before a user or service ID accesses a resource. CBRs add to the protection by cutting off network access based on origin criteria and other rules, but they do not replace proper IAM configuration. Additionally, many services support limiting network traffic to private endpoints, thereby already reducing access options.\n\nYou might find that some rules impact the comfort of administrating resources, e.g., through the browser console. Moreover, you need to make sure that you don't deny yourself access to resources, management dashboards and APIs. Thus, you have to account for bastion hosts, corporate networks, gateways and maybe even Cloud Shell. In addition, some services support a fine-grained distinction of data plane and control place access for CBR configuration, e.g., [Kubernetes Service cluster and management APIs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cbrprotect-api-types-cbr).\n\nIn summary, these questions should be asked:\n\n\n\n* Are all resources protected by IAM and similar?\n* How are the resources accessed, are they already limited to private endpoints where possible?\n* Is it possible to separate data plane and control plane access?\n* What is traffic related to usage, which to administrative work?

Density can be impacted when a mention that is significant in the domain literature occurs often, but is annotated as different types across the document set.\n\nLow precision is often an indication that you need to improve annotation consistency. To do so, review the annotation guidelines, better train the human annotators, and ensure that human annotators are working in concert and not in isolation from one another.\n\nCheck the inter-annotator agreement score.

Not only does this score tell you the quality of the ground truth documents that will be used to train the machine learning model, but it also indicates the upper bound of machine learning model performance. A model that is trained on these documents is unlikely to outperform the best agreement that humans can reach. For example, if performance persists at 75 and does not go higher, take a look at the inter-annotator agreement results. If the inter-annotator agreement score is 80, take actions to better train the human annotators and ensure that conflicts are correctly resolved (according to the annotation guidelines) during adjudication.

Density can be impacted when a mention that is significant in the domain literature occurs often, but is annotated as different types across the document set.\n\nLow precision is often an indication that you need to improve annotation consistency. To do so, review the annotation guidelines, better train the human annotators, and ensure that human annotators are working in concert and not in isolation from one another.\n\nCheck the inter-annotator agreement score. This score, which measures the degree of agreement between different annotators' output on the same document, is a valuable number. Not only does this score tell you the quality of the ground truth documents that will be used to train the machine learning model, but it also indicates the upper bound of machine learning model performance. A model that is trained on these documents is unlikely to outperform the best agreement that humans can reach. For example, if performance persists at 75 and does not go higher, take a look at the inter-annotator agreement results. If the inter-annotator agreement score is 80, take actions to better train the human annotators and ensure that conflicts are correctly resolved (according to the annotation guidelines) during adjudication. If humans can't agree on how something should be labeled, then it's unlikely that a machine learning model will apply the correct labels.\n* Enhance human annotator guidelines\n\nClear and comprehensive annotator guidelines are a crucial part of a harmonious and successful annotation development effort. Human annotators have a tough job to do. There can be nuances in assigning entity and relation types that are hard to anticipate until you start to work with the domain documents.

NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs.

These applications and tenants require isolation from each other for security, fault isolation, and avoiding overlapping IP addressing issues. The NSX logical switch creates logical broadcast domains or segments (VXLAN vWires) to which an application or tenant virtual machine can be logically wired. This feature allows for flexibility and speed of deployment while still providing all the characteristics of a physical network's broadcast domains (VLANs) without physical Layer 2 sprawl. Logical switches allow for thousands of tenant networks to be provisioned onto a single IBM Cloud private network (VLAN). A logical switch is distributed and can span arbitrarily large compute clusters, even across pods within the same data center. This distribution allows for virtual machine mobility within the data center without limitations of physical Layer 2 (VLAN) boundaries across pods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logical routers \n\nDynamic routing provides the necessary forwarding information between Layer 2 broadcast domains (VXLAN, vWires, Logical Switches).

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16387-7-1890","score":21.58553,"text":"\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public\/private key pair.

Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16389-0-2061","score":19.253107,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Configuring style and appearance \n\nOn the Style tab, you can configure the overall appearance of the web chat widget.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version. If the version you had selected is no longer supported, Watson Assistant retrains using the version labeled as Previous. This means that your assistant will automatically have the supported technologies applied. Assistants that have been modified during the previous 6 months will not be affected. For more information, see [Algorithm version](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version).\n\nIn most cases, this retraining will be seamless from an end-user point of view. The same inputs will result in the same actions, intents, and entities being detected. In some cases, the retraining might cause changes in accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-auto-retrain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09920-5038-6185","score":18.22607,"text":"\nCreate a Banking Chatbot \n\nUse Node.js and Watson to detect emotion, identify entities, and discover answers.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/patterns\/create-cognitive-banking-chatbot\/)\n* [Get the Code ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/watson-banking-chatbot?cm_sp=IBMCode-_-create-cognitive-banking-chatbot-_-Get-the-Code)\n* [View the Demo ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Jxi7U7VOMYg&cm_sp=IBMCode-_-create-cognitive-banking-chatbot-_-View-the-Demo)\n* [Build from a Starter Kit ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/console.bluemix.net\/developer\/watson\/create-project?starterKit=a5819b41-0f6f-34cb-9067-47fd16835d04&cm_sp=dw-bluemix-_-code-_-devcenter)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enrich multimedia files using Watson services \n\nBuild an app that enriches audio and visual files using IBM Watson services.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more !","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-sample-apps"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.296081911,"ndcg_cut_5":0.4776237035,"ndcg_cut_10":0.4776237035}}

These features are available for both the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.\n\nThe features involve the use of elements of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). The descriptions of the features provide information about how they interact with related SSML elements and attributes.\n\n\n\n Using speaking styles \n\nThe expressive neural voices determine the sentiment of the text from the context of its words and phrases. The speech that they produce, in addition to having a very conversational style, reflects the mood of the text. The expressive voices naturally express gratitude, thankfulness, happiness, empathy, confusion, and other sentiments by default, with no explicit additional tagging.\n\nHowever, you can embellish the voices' natural tendencies by using the <express-as> element with the required style attribute to indicate that all or some of the text is to emphasize specific characteristics. These characteristics are referred to as speaking styles:\n\n\n\n* cheerful - Expresses happiness and good news. The style is upbeat, welcoming, and conveys a positive message.\n* empathetic - Expresses empathy and compassion. The style has sympathetic undertones, but it is not excessively sorrowful.\n* neutral - Expresses objectivity and evenness. The style strives for less emotion, and instead conveys a more even and instructional tone.\n* uncertain - Expresses uncertainty and confusion. The style conveys the feeling of being unsure or in doubt.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the effect of the styles is very subtle. In such cases, the differences might not be readily discernible from the default expressive tone. But there are instances where the style can audibly enhance the voices' inherent ability to detect and express emotion. The differences are often detectable only on certain words and phrases.\n\nTable 1 provides examples of each available style for the <express-as> element. To demonstrate the effect of the styles, the table provides two samples for each example. The first sample speaks the text with the default en-US_EmmaExpressive voice.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-synthesis-expressive"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09921-7-1813","score":13.858529,"text":"\nTone analytics (Classifications) \n\nTone analytics is currently available for English and French languages only, as indicated in the [language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-language-support) topic.\n\nTone analysis is done by using a pre-built classifications model, which provides an easy way to detect language tones in written text.

It can also suggest alternative words that are acoustically similar to the words of a transcript. In both cases, the keywords and word alternatives must meet a user-specified level of confidence.\n\n\n\n Keyword spotting \n\nThe keywords and keywords_threshold parameters are supported only with previous-generation models, not with next-generation models.\n\nThe keyword spotting feature detects specified strings in a transcript. The service can spot the same keyword multiple times and report each occurrence. The service spots keywords only in the final results, not in interim results. By default, the service does no keyword spotting.\n\nTo use keyword spotting, you must specify both of the following parameters:\n\n\n\n* Use the keywords parameter to specify an array of strings to be spotted. The service spots no keywords if you omit the parameter or specify an empty array. A keyword string can include more than one token. For example, the keyword Speech to Text has three tokens. Keyword matching is case-insensitive, so Speech to Text is effectively equivalent to speech to text.\n\nFor US English, the service normalizes each keyword to match spoken versus written strings. For example, it normalizes numbers to match how they are spoken as opposed to written. For other languages, keywords must be specified as they are spoken.\n* Use the keywords_threshold parameter to specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0 for a keyword match. The threshold indicates the lower bound for the level of confidence the service must have for a word to match the keyword. A keyword is spotted in the transcript only if its confidence is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.\n\nSpecifying a small threshold can potentially produce many matches. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. Omit the parameter to return no matches.\n\n\n\nThe following limits apply to keyword spotting:\n\n\n\n* You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request.\n* A single keyword can have a maximum length of 1024 characters. The maximum effective length for double-byte languages might be shorter.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09906-1621-3194","score":15.608522,"text":"\ncurl -X POST -u \"apikey:{apikey}\" --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" --data '{\n\"url\": \"http:\/\/newsroom.ibm.com\/Guerbet-and-IBM-Watson-Health-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-for-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Medical-Imaging-Liver\",\n\"features\": {\n\"sentiment\": {},\n\"categories\": {},\n\"concepts\": {},\n\"entities\": {},\n\"keywords\": {}\n}\n}' \"{url}\/v1\/analyze?version=2019-07-12\"\n\nWindows users: This command might not run on Windows.

These features are available for both the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.\n\nThe features involve the use of elements of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). The descriptions of the features provide information about how they interact with related SSML elements and attributes.\n\n\n\n Using speaking styles \n\nThe expressive neural voices determine the sentiment of the text from the context of its words and phrases. The speech that they produce, in addition to having a very conversational style, reflects the mood of the text. The expressive voices naturally express gratitude, thankfulness, happiness, empathy, confusion, and other sentiments by default, with no explicit additional tagging.\n\nHowever, you can embellish the voices' natural tendencies by using the <express-as> element with the required style attribute to indicate that all or some of the text is to emphasize specific characteristics. These characteristics are referred to as speaking styles:\n\n\n\n* cheerful - Expresses happiness and good news. The style is upbeat, welcoming, and conveys a positive message.\n* empathetic - Expresses empathy and compassion. The style has sympathetic undertones, but it is not excessively sorrowful.\n* neutral - Expresses objectivity and evenness. The style strives for less emotion, and instead conveys a more even and instructional tone.\n* uncertain - Expresses uncertainty and confusion. The style conveys the feeling of being unsure or in doubt.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the effect of the styles is very subtle. In such cases, the differences might not be readily discernible from the default expressive tone. But there are instances where the style can audibly enhance the voices' inherent ability to detect and express emotion. The differences are often detectable only on certain words and phrases.\n\nTable 1 provides examples of each available style for the <express-as> element. To demonstrate the effect of the styles, the table provides two samples for each example. The first sample speaks the text with the default en-US_EmmaExpressive voice.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-synthesis-expressive"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03353-8238-10149","score":15.210342,"text":"\n[Bidi options](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/bidi-options.png)\n3. Click the X to close the page. Your changes are saved automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Working with accented characters \n\nIn a conversational setting, users might or might not use accents while interacting with the Watson Assistant service. As such, both accented and non-accented versions of words might be treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever for some languages, like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity might implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word \"barri\u00f3\", which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb \"barrer\" (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word \"barrio\" (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" vs. \"una\". In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}
