It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise , and the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) considers it to be one of the `` most important championships available to the sport '' . Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . After a series of league mergers and folds , it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 .", "title": "Stanley Cup", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "798029343_451-1065-0-614", "score": 16.193016, "text": "America's Cup\nThe America 's Cup , affectionately known as the `` Auld Mug '' , is a trophy awarded to the winner of the America 's Cup match races between two sailing yachts .

It is unusual among trophies to include winning members ' names . Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted . Initially a new band added each year , though this caused the trophy to grow in size , earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup '' . In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom .

Although Chancellor for only just over four years , Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period . Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after Günter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi .

The Mongols had cut off the trade route , the Silk Road , between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe . The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants ' last trading station in the region , Caffa in the Crimea . In late 1346 , plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town . When spring arrived , the Italian merchants fled on their ships , unknowingly carrying the Black Death .

In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 Δ32 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

The original compounds used were 5 - iodo - 2 ' - deoxyuridine , AKA idoxuridine , IUdR , or ( IDU ) and 1 - β - D - arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara - C , later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine .

The introduction of 9 - β - D - arabinofuranosyladenine , ( ara - A or vidarabine ) , considerably less toxic than ara - C , in the mid-1970s , heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment . Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life - threatening HSV disease . Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977 .

The introduction of 9 - ( 2 - hydroxyethoxymethyl ) guanine , AKA acyclovir , in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s .

During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludvík Vaculík as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_588-1089-0-501", "score": 24.548326, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also known as cavy or domestic cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia .

This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 , which provided for comprehensive planning , technical services , research , and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure . The Act was amended in 1965 , establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so . Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s , in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns . In 1970 EPA was created by the Richard Nixon administration , and authority for managing various environmental programs was transferred to the new agency . In 1972 , Congress passed the Clean Water Act , requiring industrial plants and municipal sewage plants to proactively improve their waste treatment practices in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources . In 1974 , the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems . This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed . From then on , drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal , state , and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations . The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion in research and construction grants for municipal sewage treatment . The funds initially provided an incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure for municipalities , instead of decentralized systems . However , the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems , and financial assistance was made available for such alternatives . In the mid-1990s decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population , and approximately 37 percent of new housing developments .", "title": "Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "848935469_49499-50382-0-883", "score": 16.501654, "text": "Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States\nIn a January 2012 U.S. National Research Council report , a committee of independent experts found that expanding the reuse of municipal wastewater for irrigation , industrial uses , and drinking water augmentation could significantly increase the United States ' total available water resources .

Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement .

As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E.

Luckily , I 've been doing about , you know , 800 to 967 push - ups every day , so it 's not a big deal , I can handle it . '' Regardless , this achievement , Mars was cautious : `` The actions in this video serve as a metaphor , and should not be taken literally .

In an interview with Sound on Sound , engineer Ari Levine from The Smeezingtons , who carried out the recording and instrumentation on `` Grenade '' , explained that the song was original recorded with `` a more guitar ‐ based arrangement '' , 15bpm faster . According to Mars , the record was much happier . Mars ended up by playing the song live in showcase for the label and to several booking agents in a slower tempo . The singer and his bandmates rehearsed a lot to that show , yet `` Grenade '' `` sounded terrible '' . Mars decided to do a `` stripped down '' version by playing the guitar , while Brody Brown played the piano . The single received praise from the label . The song was reproduced in the way you hear it . To do so , The Smeezingtons completely rearranged and re ‐ recorded it , including the vocals , `` two days before the album was supposed to be handed in '' . Levine , added `` There was quite a bit of deadline stress involved in that .

The middle of the third decade , in an effort to counter other networks ' efforts to counterprogram the game , saw the introduction of popular music acts such as New Kids on the Block , Gloria Estefan , Michael Jackson , Clint Black , Patti LaBelle , and Tony Bennett . Starting with Super Bowl XXXII , commercial sponsors presented the halftime show ; within five years , the tradition of having a theme -- begun with Super Bowl III -- ended , replaced by major music productions by arena rock bands and other high - profile acts . In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson 's breasts in an alleged `` wardrobe malfunction '' , all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group , with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s . These shows were considered `` family friendly '' and the time in which they took place has been described as `` the age of reactionary halftime shows .

The economic power remained focused on Rome and its hyper - rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of Italy and Africa in particular . After Gallienus banned senators from army commands in the mid-3rd century , the senatorial elite lost all experience of -- and interest in -- military life . In the early 5th century the wealthy landowning elite of the Roman Senate largely barred its tenants from military service , but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend the entire Western Empire . The West 's most important military area had been northern Gaul and the Rhine frontier in the 4th century , when Trier frequently served as the capital of the Empire and many leading Western generals were Barbarians . After the civil war in 394 between Theodosius I and the usurper Eugenius , the new Western government installed by Theodosius I increasingly had to divert military resources from Britain and the Rhine to protect Italy . This , in turn , led to further rebellions and civil wars because the Western imperial government was not providing the military protection the northern provinces expected and needed against the barbarians .", "title": "Western Roman Empire", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "804622010_16826-17108-0-282", "score": 17.590826, "text": "Byzantine Empire\nIn 480 with the death of the Western Emperor Julius Nepos , Eastern Emperor Zeno became sole Emperor of the empire .

Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina . These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level , usually propelled southward from Arctic high pressure over the Northeastern or New England states . If the storms track sufficiently far to the east , snow will be limited to the eastern part of the state ( as with the December 22 - 23 , 1989 storm ) . If the cyclones travel close to the coast , warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean , bringing a rain / snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont , foothills and mountains , as with the January 22 , 1987 storm . If the storm tracks inland into eastern North Carolina , the rain / snow line ranges between Raleigh and Greensboro .", "title": "Climate of North Carolina", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "803493063_1914-2425-0-511", "score": 20.25037, "text": "Climate of North Carolina\nThere is an average of forty - five inches of rain a year ( fifty in the mountains ) .

After an encouraging success at Camden , Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina . However , any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the Battle of Kings Mountain , and the British Legion , the cream of his army , had been decisively defeated at the Battle of Cowpens . Following both defeats , Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support . Despite the defeats , Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina , gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized . As a result , subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace , as at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse , and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive war of attrition . Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest .

This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling . The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin ; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls , such as those in Gubeikou , often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them . The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass : instead of laying siege , the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates .

The poem tells of a king , now identified as King Xuan ( r . 827 -- 782 BC ) of the Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046 -- 771 BC ) , who commanded General Nan Zhong ( 南仲 ) to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the Xianyun . The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 -- 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( 成 周 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 -- 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1,400 metres ( 4,600 feet ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in Hancheng , Shaanxi . Even non-Chinese peoples built walls , such as the Di state of Zhongshan and the Yiqu Rong ( 義 渠 ) , whose walls were intended to defend against the State of Qin .", "title": "History of the Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801328598_32760-33956-0-1182", "score": 22.183704, "text": "History of the Great Wall of China\nSoon after the establishment of the Tang dynasty , during the reign of Emperor Taizong ( r . 626 -- 649 ) , the threat of Göktürk tribesmen from the north prompted some court officials to suggest drafting corvée labourers to repair the aging Great Wall . Taizong scoffed at the suggestion , alluding to the Sui walls built in vain : `` The Emperor Yang of Sui made the people labor to construct the Great Wall in order to defend against the Turks , but in the end this was of no use . '' Instead of building walls , Taizong claimed he `` need merely to establish Li Shiji in Jinyang for the dust on the border to settle .

The 1473 victory in the Battle of Red Salt Lake ( 紅 鹽池 ) by Wang Yue ( 王 越 ) deterred Mongol invasions long enough for Yu Zijun to complete his wall project in 1474 . This wall , a combined effort between Yu Zijun and Wang Yue , stretched from present day Hengcheng ( 橫 城 ) in Lingwu ( northwestern Ningxia province ) to Huamachi town ( 花 馬 池 鎮 ) in Yanchi County , and from there to Qingshuiying ( 清水 營 ) in northeastern Shaanxi , a total of more than 2000 li ( about 1,100 kilometres ( 680 mi ) ) long . Along its length were 800 strong points , sentry posts , beacon - fire towers , and assorted defences . 40,000 men were enlisted for this effort , which was completed in several months at a cost of over one million silver taels . This defence system proved its initial worth in 1482 , when a large group of Mongol raiders were trapped within the double lines of fortifications and suffered a defeat by the Ming generals . This was seen as a vindication of Yu Zijun 's strategy of wall - building by the people of the border areas . By the mid-16th century , Yu 's wall in the Ordos had seen expansion into an extensive defence system . It contained two defence lines : Yu 's wall , called the `` great border '' ( 大 邊 , dàbiān ) , and a `` secondary border '' ( 二 邊 , èrbiān ) built by Yang Yiqing ( 楊一清 ; 1454 -- 1530 ) behind it .", "title": "History of the Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801328598_23977-25578-0-1601", "score": 21.967485, "text": "History of the Great Wall of China\nAs the Han -- Xiongnu War progressed in favour of the Han , the Wall became maintained and extended beyond Qin lines .

In this way , Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe . In addition to rebuilding the walls , archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu 's reign . The fortifications here include embankments , beacon stations , and forts , all constructed with a combination of tamped - earth cores and stone frontages . From the Ordos Loop , the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei , Zhangye , and Jiuquan , leading into the Juyan Lake Basin , and terminating in two places : the Yumen Pass in the north , or the Yang Pass to the south , both in the vicinity of Dunhuang . Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications -- further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass , about 460 kilometres ( 290 mi ) to the east .

Later in the same year , the dry - stone walls of the Jizhou -- Changping area ( abbreviated as `` Ji - Chang '' ) were replaced by stone and mortar . These allowed the Chinese to build on steeper , more easily defended slopes and facilitated construction of features such as ramparts , crenelations , and peepholes .

In the following year , 214 BC , Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north . This work was completed probably by 212 BC , signalled by Qin Shi Huang 's imperial tour of inspection and the construction of the Direct Road ( 直道 ) connecting the capital Xianyang with the Ordos .

In this way , Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe .

However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate . The average size of land holdings is very small , with 70 % of holdings being less than one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) in size . Irrigation facilities are inadequate , as revealed by the fact that only 46 % of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016 , resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall , specifically the monsoon season , which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country . In an effort to bring an additional two crore hectares ( 20 million hectares ; 50 million acres ) of land under irrigation , various schemes have been attempted , including the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme ( AIBP ) which was provided ₹ 80,000 crore ( ₹ 800 billion ) in the union budget . Farming incomes are also hampered by lack of food storage and distribution infrastructure ; a third of India 's agricultural production is lost from spoilage .", "title": "Economy of India", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846588693_6233-9128-0-2422", "score": 19.045315, "text": "Green Revolution in India\n49 % of people in India are employed in agriculture . The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit . These inputs were easily available in at least parts of the states of Punjab , Haryana , and western Uttar Pradesh ; thus , yields increased most in these states .", "title": "Green Revolution in India", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846587463_29620-30826-0-1206", "score": 18.902714, "text": "Economy of India\nIndia ranks second worldwide in farm output .

The very act of putting on a play by Shakespeare , formerly condemned as a `` bourgeois Western imperialist author '' whom no Chinese could respect , was in and of itself an act of quiet dissent . Of all Shakespeare 's plays , the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was Macbeth , as Chinese audiences saw in a play first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland a parallel with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s . The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and furthermore , the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power - hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing . Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' . Another critic , Zhao Xun wrote `` Macbeth is the fifth Shakespearean play produced on the Chinese stage after the smashing of the Gang of Four .

Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain , as in Romeo 's situation with Rosaline . This sonnet form is used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man . When Romeo and Juliet meet , the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan ( which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare 's day ) to a then more contemporary sonnet form , using `` pilgrims '' and `` saints '' as metaphors . Finally , when the two meet on the balcony , Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love , but Juliet breaks it by saying `` Dost thou love me ? '' By doing this , she searches for true expression , rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love . Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo but uses formal language with Paris . Other forms in the play include an epithalamium by Juliet , a rhapsody in Mercutio 's Queen Mab speech , and an elegy by Paris . Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play , though at times he uses it for other characters , such as Mercutio . Humour , also , is important : scholar Molly Mahood identifies at least 175 puns and wordplays in the text . Many of these jokes are sexual in nature , especially those involving Mercutio and the Nurse .", "title": "Romeo and Juliet", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "806376271_1466-1955-0-489", "score": 16.572075, "text": "Romeo and Juliet\nShakespeare 's use of his poetic dramatic structure ( especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension , his expansion of minor characters , and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story ) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill .

Even today he is remembered as the man who united India . He is , in this regard , compared to Otto von Bismarck of Germany , who did the same thing in the 1860s . Under the plan of 3 June , more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan , or choosing independence . Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede , most of the people and territory would be fragmented . The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion . Gandhi had said to Patel , `` ( T ) he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it '' . Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task . He asked V. P. Menon , a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India , to become his right - hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry . On 6 May 1947 , Patel began lobbying the princes , attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts . Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs , inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi . At these meetings , Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order . Patel invoked the patriotism of India 's monarchs , asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people . He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic , especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects . He proposed favourable terms for the merger , including the creation of privy purses for the rulers ' descendants . While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism , Patel did not rule out force . Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith , he set a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document . All but three of the states willingly merged into the Indian union ; only Jammu and Kashmir , Junagadh , and Hyderabad did not fall into his basket .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ?

Evans ' design eventually displaced the traditional gristmills . By the turn of the century , Evans also developed one of the first high - pressure steam engines and began establishing a network of machine workshops to manufacture and repair these popular inventions . In 1789 , the widow of Nathanael Greene recruited Eli Whitney to develop a machine to separate the seeds of short fibered cotton from the fibers . The resulting cotton gin could be made with basic carpentry skills but reduced the necessary labor by a factor of 50 and generated huge profits for cotton growers in the South . While Whitney did not realize financial success from his invention , he moved on to manufacturing rifles and other armaments under government contract that could be made with `` expedition , uniformity , and exactness '' -- the foundational ideas for interchangeable parts .

Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies , particularly in Haiti , but Haitian cotton production was halted by the Haitian Revolution in 1791 . The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable , leading to widespread growth of cotton plantations in the United States and Brazil . ( A strain of cotton seed brought to Natchez in 1806 , Gossypium hirsutum , would become the parent genetic material for over 90 % of world cotton production to come : it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to pick . ) The Americas , particularly the U.S. , had labor shortages and high priced labor , which made slavery attractive .

The British use of air power evolved during the war , from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of the air above the trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind the line . The early aircraft of the RFC were inferior to their German rivals ; in April 1917 , ( known as Bloody April ) , the RFC lost over 300 aircrew and 245 aircraft .
