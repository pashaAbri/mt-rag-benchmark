Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document.

These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it. To test whether your fixes address the issue, you can convert the original file to a PDF file to check for unexpected carriage returns in the text.\n\nAfter applying a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model to a PPT file, table boundaries are not recognized properly\n: During the conversion process, text that is extracted from the table is confused with text that is outside the table in some PPT pages.

For example, if a table row in a DOCX file contains cell values that do not end with a period, the values might be converted as one sentence. As another example, if a PDF document contains a very long word that is hyphenated at the end of a line, that word might be converted as two words.

For example, if you want to attach a .jpg image file to a document, you specify the attachment MIME type as image\/jpeg.\n\nAttachments aren't permitted on documents in [_replicator](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostreplicate) or [_users](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantputsecurity) databases.\n\n\n\n Create or update \n\nTo create a new attachment at the same time as creating a new document, include the attachment as an [inline](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachmentsinline) component of the JSON content.\n\nTo create a new attachment on an existing document, or to update an attachment on a document, make a PUT request with the document's most recent _rev to https:\/\/$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\/$DATABASE\/$DOCUMENT_ID\/$ATTACHMENT.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04543-306793-308516","score":13.6451012852,"text":"\n* ibmcloud is instance-template-create --interactive Create instance template interactively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Command options \n\n\n\n* INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME: Name of the instance template.\n* VPC: ID or name of the VPC.\n* ZONE_NAME: Name of the zone.\n* PROFILE_NAME: Name of the profile.\n* SUBNET: ID or name of the subnet.\n* --image: ID or name of the image.\n* --catalog-offering: The CRN for the IBM Cloud catalog offering.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

With IBM Cloud\u00ae App ID, you can configure one or several identity providers to create a custom sign-in experience for your users.\n\nApp ID interacts with identity providers by using various protocols such as OpenID Connect, SAML, and more. For example, OpenID Connect is the protocol that is used with many social providers such as Facebook, Google. Enterprise providers such as [Azure Active Directory](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-azure-active-directory) or [Active Directory Federation Service](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-active-directory-federation-service), generally use SAML as their identity protocol. For [Cloud Directory](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), the service uses SCIM to verify identity information.\n\nWhen you use social or enterprise identity providers, App ID reads user account information. Because the service never has write access to the information, users must go through their chosen identity provider to do actions, such as resetting their password. For example, if a user signs in to your app with Facebook, and then wanted to change their password, they must go to www.facebook.com to do so.\n\nWhen you use [Cloud Directory](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), App ID is the identity provider.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16026-0-358","score":12.5107056804,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  VNF limitations \n\nHigh Availability (HA) Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployments have the following known limitations.\n\n\n\n*  The Virtual Network Function (VNF) must share one subnet with the Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n*  Routing public internet \"ingress\" traffic to a VNF is not supported.\n*  Auto-scaling with the VNF is not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vnf-limitations"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04709-1717-3966","score":12.411619174,"text":"\nPricing Hourly and monthly billing, plus suspend billing features Hourly, suspend billing, and sustained usage discount \n Virtual server families Public, dedicated, transient, reserved Public, dedicated \n Profiles All profiles, including the GPU profiles Balanced, compute, memory profiles with higher RAM and vCPU options \n Supported images Full set of pre-stock images, plus custom images Limited set of pre-stock images, plus the ability to import a custom image \n Platform integration IAM and resource group integration for a unified experience \n\n\n\nSuspend billing supports only hourly, SAN instances that are provisioned with a public profile from one of the Balanced, Compute, Memory, or Variable compute families.\n\n\n\n\n\n Network differentiators \n\nSee the following table for the networking differences between classic and VPC.\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Common deployments of NSX Edge include in the DMZ, VPN extranets, and multi-tenant cloud environments where the NSX Edge creates virtual boundaries for each tenant.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmware?topic=vmware-nsx-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07717-6101-8054","score":11.664353948,"text":"\nin deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) has no rules in the default security group<br> * Check whether App ID Cloud Directory users aren't able to self-sign up to applications<br> * Check whether all network interfaces of a virtual server instance have at least one Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security group attached<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether Virtual Servers for VPC instance has the minimum # interfaces<br> * Check whether App ID redirect URIs are using HTTPS only<br> * Check whether Cloud Internet Services (CIS) has TLS mode set to End-to-End CA signed<br> * Check whether Application Load Balancer for VPC pool uses the HTTPS protocol for HTTPS listeners<br> * Check whether Application Load Balancer for VPC uses HTTPS (SSL & TLS) instead of HTTP<br> * Check whether Cloud Object Storage public access is disabled in IAM settings (not applicable to ACLs managed using S3 APIs)<br> * Check whether App ID anonymous authentication is disabled<br> * Check whether App ID avoid password reuse policy is enabled<br> * Check whether App ID user profile updates from client apps is disabled<br> * Check whether Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network access control lists don't allow ingress from 0.0.0.0\/0 to RDP port<br> * Check whether App ID redirect URIs are not using localhost or 127.0.0.1<br> * Check whether Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network access control lists don't allow ingress from 0.0.0.0\/0 to SSH port<br> * Check whether Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network access control lists don't allow egress from 0.0.0.0\/0 to any port<br><br><br> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NIST supplemental guidance \n\nInformation systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services.

As the demands on data centers continue to grow and accelerate, requirements that are related to speed and access to the data itself continue to grow as well. In most infrastructures, virtual machine access and mobility usually depend on physical networking infrastructure and the physical networking environments they reside in. This dependency can force virtual workloads into less than ideal environments due to potential layer 2 or layer 3 boundaries, such as being tied to specific IBM Cloud Private Networks (VLANs) in specific pods. NSX vSwitch places these virtual workloads on any available infrastructure in the data center, regardless of the underlying physical network infrastructure. This ability not only allows increased flexibility and mobility, but increased availability and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n NSX controller \n\nNSX controller is an advanced distributed state management system that controls virtual networks and VXLAN overlay transport tunnels. NSX controller is the central control point for all logical switches within a network and maintains information of all virtual machines, hosts, logical switches, and VXLANs. The controller supports three logical switch control plane modes, Multicast, Unicast, and Hybrid. These modes decouple NSX from the physical network. IBM Cloud requires Unicast mode as IBM Cloud Private Networks (VLANs) do not offer IGMP services for Multicast or Hybrid mode. The NSX Controller uses Unicast mode with virtual tunnel endpoints (VTEPS) to provide MAC learning and other functions to allow VXLAN Broadcast, Unknown unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic within a logical switch. The unicast mode replicates all the BUM traffic locally on the host and requires no physical network configuration outside of Layer 3 connectivity between VTEPS. NSX Controllers are deployed by the NSX Manager as a minimum set of three controller nodes, and various other nodes to support (distributed) Layer 3 routing services. All of the nodes are deployed as virtual machines and are managed by the NSX Manager on an ESX Management Cluster at IBM Cloud.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmware?topic=vmware-nsx-overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.6666666667,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.703918089,"ndcg_cut_5":0.703918089,"ndcg_cut_10":0.703918089}}

Catalog syntax is compatible with Hive metastore syntax. See how to [work with the catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogusage) and refer to the [Catalog management](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterHiveCatalog) section of the SQL reference.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\nYou can explore, change, or discover structured data on [Cloud Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage\/getting-started.htmlgetting-started-console) with Data Engine by using SQL syntax. To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13480-7832-9910","score":11.8517775337,"text":"\nSELECT * FROM cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/customers.csv\nINTO cos:\/\/us-geo\/mybucket\/customers_partitioned.csv\nPARTITIONED BY (country)\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Attach table partitions \n\nAfter you defined a partitioned table, it is initially empty and you must attach the partitions to it explicitly. A convenient way to add all partitions that exist on Object Storage, is to use the following RECOVER PARTITIONS clause.\n\nALTER TABLE customers RECOVER PARTITIONS\n\nThis clause overwrites the current partition definitions for the table with the structure that is detected from Object Storage data by using the location prefix that is specified for the table. You can also update partition definitions selectively with the ADD PARTITION and DROP PARTITION clauses of the ALTER TABLE statement, for example, to attach more data to a table that was uploaded recently.\n\nWhen you added all partitions, the partitioned table is set up to be queried. You get all the German customers, if you submit the following query:\n\nSELECT customerID FROM customers WHERE country = 'Germany'\n\nThe query execution reads the objects only under the cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/customers_partitioned.csv\/country=Germany\/ prefix because the partition definitions are used by the query optimizer to minimize the necessary data transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Limitations \n\n\n\n* With the Standard plan, you can create up to 100 tables with up to 20,000 partitions per table.\n* If you use the Lite plan, the catalog management features, such as CREATE TABLE, are not allowed.\n* The ADD PARTITION option of the ALTER TABLE statement may not correctly locate partitions if the value for a partition column contains special characters, such as the colon : that can appear as a timestamp separator.\n\nWhen the location is inferred from one or more partition values, some special characters in the values are URL escaped when you construct the Object Storage location. For example, the statement ALTER TABLE mytable ADD PARTITION ( startTime = '2020-01-01 12:00:00' ) constructs a partition with an Object Storage location ...\/startTime=2020-01-01 12%3A00%3A00\/.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09991-7-1416","score":11.7818232906,"text":"\nQuerying historical data \n\nYou can run the queries by using the command-line or the [query editor inside the web console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/netezza?topic=netezza-query-editor).\n\nThe following table definition is used for the example queries.\n\nCREATE TABLE PRODUCT (PRODUCTID INTEGER, DESC VARCHAR (100), PRICE DECIMAL) DATA_VERSION_RETENTION_TIME 30;\n\nThe following rows are inserted at different times.

Indexing helps your queries remain performant as your application scales.\n\nWhen you tell IBM Cloudant to create a secondary index, it starts a background task that looks at all the documents in turn and creates a new data structure on disk: the index. The index is a balanced tree which pairs the keys (the attribute or attributes that you need indexed) with the document _id they came from.\n\nThe index can be used to efficiently lookup known keys and ranges of keys without having to rescan the entire database.\n\nAnother trick that you can employ at index time is the partial filter. You can optionally supply a partial filter in your index definition. This IBM Cloudant Query selector is executed at index time to decide which documents' data makes it to the index and which are ignored.\n\nIn this example, a selector is employed that allows only dates that fall on a weekend to make it to the index.

(For an example, see Step 3 in [Viewing flow log objects](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-fl-analyze). However, for a more convenient way of querying, it is recommended that you create table and view definitions that give you a flattened view on your flows. For more information about table catalog functions and benefits, see [Getting started with the catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog).\n\nThe view flattens the flow log data structure; thus, making it easier to analyze your flows.\n\nFor more elaborate and repeatable analysis, such as when you want to collaborate and share your log analysis, it is recommended that you use IBM Cloud\u00ae Data Engine through Jupyter Notebooks (for example, through IBM Watson Studio).

There are two ways to access the training page in the Discovery tooling:\n\n\n\n* For an individual collection, on the Build queries screen, click Train Watson to improve results on the upper right. You don't need to enter a query on the Build queries screen to start training.\n* From the Performance dashboard. Click on the View data metrics icon on the left to open the dashboard. You are prompted to choose a collection to train.\n\n\n\n2. On the Train Watson screen, click Add a natural language query, for example: \"IBM Watson in healthcare\", and add it. Make sure your queries are written the way your users would ask them. Also, it is recommended that training queries be written with some term overlap between the query and the desired answer. This overlap improves initial results, when the natural language query is run.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-tooling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13075-3392-5440","score":14.7018984749,"text":"\nYou are prompted to choose a collection to train.\n\n\n\n2.

Also, it is recommended that training queries be written with some term overlap between the query and the desired answer. This overlap improves initial results, when the natural language query is run. Relevance training only uses natural language queries, so do not enter queries written in the Discovery Query Language.\n3. To view the results of your query, click the Rate Results button next to it. If you don't think there are enough results, you could try rewriting the query, or adding more documents to this collection via the Manage data screen.\n4. Begin rating results as either Relevant or Not relevant. When you are done, click Back to queries. In the Discovery tooling, Relevant has a score of 10 and Not relevanthas a score of 0. If you already started rating results for this collection, using the API, and used a different scoring scale, a warning is displayed, with options to fix the issue. At the top of the screen, Watson tracks the training status and provides tips about what you can do to improve results. \"Add more variety to your ratings\" means that you might want to use both the Relevant and Not relevant ratings. After you meet the requirements, training starts updating periodically. Most training takes less than 30 minutes to complete, but you can continue working while training is underway.\n5.

The threshold for Messages for RabbitMQ is 80% of your deployment's disk size. The alarm blocks incoming messages from publishers and prevents messages in memory from being written to disk. The alarm is cluster-wide so if disk space on one node gets too low, the alarm blocks on all nodes. To clear the alarm, either messages that have been written to disk need to be consumed and that space is reclaimed, or scale your deployment to a larger disk size.\n\nMore information about memory alarms can be found in the [RabbitMQ documentation](https:\/\/www.rabbitmq.com\/disk-alarms.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n Disk IOPS \n\nThe number of input\/output operations per second (IOPS) is limited by the type of storage volume that is being used.

IOPS limits can affect RabbitMQ message throughput and storage operations.

A snapshot represents a volume's contents at a particular point in time. With snapshots, you can protect your data with no performance impact and minimal consumption of space. Snapshots are considered your first line of defense for data protection. If a user accidentally modifies or deletes crucial data from a volume, the data can be easily and quickly restored from a snapshot copy.\n\nBlock Storage for Classic provides you with two ways to take your snapshots.\n\n\n\n* First, through a configurable snapshot schedule that creates and deletes snapshot copies automatically for each storage volume. You can also create extra snapshot schedules, manually delete copies, and manage schedules based on your requirements.\n* The second way is to take a manual snapshot.\n\n\n\nA snapshot copy is a read-only image of a Block Storage for Classic LUN that captures the state of the volume at a point in time. Snapshot copies are efficient both in the time that is needed to create them and in storage space. A Block Storage for Classic snapshot copy takes only a few seconds to create. It's typically less than 1 second, regardless of the size of the volume or the level of activity on the storage. After a snapshot copy is created, changes to data objects are reflected in updates to the current version of the objects, as if Snapshot copies didn't exist. Meanwhile, the copy of the data remains stable.\n\nA Snapshot copy incurs no performance decrease. Users can easily store up to 50 scheduled snapshots and 50 manual snapshots per Block Storage for Classic volume, all of which are accessible as read-only and online versions of the data.\n\nWith snapshots, you can:\n\n\n\n* Nondisruptively create point-in-time recovery points,\n* Revert volumes to previous points-in-time.\n\n\n\nYou must purchase some amount of snapshot space for your volume first so you can take snapshots of it.

With IBM\u00ae Netezza\u00ae Performance Server for IBM Cloud Pak\u00ae for Data as a Service, you can use external tables to access parquet files that are stored outside of your database in data lakes (on AWS S3). Also, you can analyze this data by using the robust and massively parallel Netezza Performance Server execution engine.\n\nExternal data sources use connection strings to specify how you can access an external system. Each connection string describes where your data is placed and how to authenticate to your data source. Each external data source has a definition (schema), but the actual data exists external to the Netezza Performance Server database.\n\nYou cannot backup (nzbackup) and restore (nzrestore) external data source objects.\n\nUse cases for external data source include:\n\n\n\n*  [Running queries against parquet data that is stored in a data lake](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/netezza?topic=netezza-querying_singularity).\n*  [Ingesting data into Netezza Performance Server](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/netezza?topic=netezza-ingest_singularity).\n*  [Querying both local and remote data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/netezza?topic=netezza-merging_singularity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/netezza?topic=netezza-overview_singularity"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13497-1510-3518","score":20.9537056046,"text":"\nExisting instances still work but will be fully deprecated on 31 October.\n\n\n\n\n\n May 2022 \n\nRebranding\n: IBM Cloud SQL Query was rebranded to IBM Cloud Data Engine.\n\nHive\n: Data Engine provides an external [Hive metastore (HMS) service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-hive_metastore).\n\n\n\n\n\n November 2021 \n\nAdd columns to Catalog tables\n: You can add columns to existing Catalog tables with the newly supported ALTER TABLE ...

This practice is costly in terms of performance, as every lookup is a full scan of the database rather than an indexed lookup. If your data is small, this full-scan lookup doesn\u2019t matter, but as the data set grows, performance becomes a problem for you, and for the cluster as a whole. It is likely that we will limit this facility soon. The IBM Cloudant Dashboard provides a method for creating indexes in an easy way.\n\nCreating indexes and crafting IBM Cloudant Queries that take advantage of them requires some flair. To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index. Some examples exist where this type of indexing is abused either deliberately, or mostly by mistake. Plan your indexing to comprise only the fields required by your actual queries. Indexes take up space and can be costly to rebuild if the number of indexed fields are large.\n\nWe also have the issue of which fields that you store in an IBM Cloudant Search.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00491-1283-3050","score":18.5982119073,"text":"\n(Optional) [Create an acurl alias](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-working-with-curlencode-user-name-and-password).\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to set up acurl, use the following URL with curl instead of the one provided in the exercises, curl \"https:\/\/$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\/databasedemo\".\n\nThe acurl alias is more secure. It prevents someone from reading your password over your shoulder as you type. It also makes sure that your password isn\u2019t sent in plain text over the network by enforcing HTTPS.\n\nNow, we're ready to learn how to run queries against the database you created in step two of [Before you begin](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-querybefore-you-begin-qt).\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Creating an index \n\nIBM Cloudant Query uses Mongo-style query syntax to search for documents by using logical operators. IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-37889-39953","score":18.4397543999,"text":"\nIf you need to access objects within documents, you can use standard dot notation for example, address.zipcode to access a postal code string inside an address object.\n\nWe can also add the following parameters:\n\nFields\n: Specifies the document attributes that we want returned (the default is the entire document).\n\nSort\n: Defines how the data is to be sorted. Sort is an array, allowing the sort to be calculated on multiple attributes.\n\nLimit\n: The number of documents to return.\n\nIf you are from a relational database background, this query is the equivalent SQL query to that last IBM Cloudant query example.\n\nThe WHERE clause is the equivalent of SELECTOR in IBM Cloudant Query. ORDER and LIMIT are exactly equivalent, and the IBM Cloudant Query FIELDS list is equivalent to the comma-separated list of attributes after the SELECT keyword.\n\nThe JSON syntax might take a bit of getting used to, but MongoDB users might find it familiar.\n\nIBM Cloudant queries can be executed in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. Select the database that you are working with, for example, books then choose the Query tab.\n\nEnter your IBM Cloudant Query JSON in the box that is provided, and click Run Query when you're ready. The result set appears on the page.\n\nThe Explain button is used to provide an explanation on how the database interprets the supplied query. This explanation becomes more important when we get to Indexing in the next part.\n\nQueries can be triggered from curl too. The Query JSON, in this case, is stored in a file and we POST to the _find endpoint by using the -d@ command-line syntax.\n\nThe Node.js code is similar. The Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century.

For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00620-32353-33729","score":17.9557108147,"text":"\n\"warning\": \"no matching index found, create an index to optimize query time\"\n}\nShow more\nThis time, you get the next five cities and a new bookmark ready for the next request.<-- <\/section \"id=\"section-use-cloudant-query-search\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-how-cloudant-search-works\" \"> --> How does IBM Cloudant Search work?

Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network.

It is your responsibility to pass the user ID information to the service. Watson Assistant checks for the following information from API requests in this order:\n\n1. user_id: A property defined in the API that is sent in the context object of a \/message API call. Using this property is the best way to ensure that you accurately attribute \/message API calls to unique users. For more information about the user ID property, see the API reference documentation:\n\n- context.global.system.user_id: [v2 API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant-data-v2message)\n- context.metadata.user_id: [v1 API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant-data-v1message)\n\n1. session_id (v2 only): A property defined in the v2 API that identifies a single conversation between a user and the assistant. A session ID is provided in \/message API calls that are generated by the built-in integrations. The session ends when a user closes integration or after the inactivity time limit is reached.\n\nIf you use the stateless v2 \/message API, you must specify the session_id with each message in an ongoing conversation (in context.global.session_id).\n{: note}\n\n1. conversation_id (v1 only): A property defined in the v1 API that is stored in the context object of a \/message API call. This property can be used to identify multiple \/message API calls that are associated with a single conversational exchange with one user. However, the same ID is only used if you explicitly retain the ID and pass it back with each request that is made as part of the same conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-services-information"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03037-2895-4808","score":6.7065299629,"text":"\nImportant: The User ID property is not equivalent to the Customer ID property, though both can be passed with the message.

It represents the level of annotation consistency between a pair of human annotators. The value can range from 0 to 1, where perfect agreement is indicated by the score 1. What constitutes an acceptable level of agreement depends on your domain data and type system. But to provide an example, here are the F1 thresholds that project managers expect to be met or exceeded in projects that are based on the KLUE type system:\n\n\n\n* Mentions with entity types: 0.85\n* Relations: 0.8\n* Coreference chains: 0.9\n\n\n\nInterpreting the scores depends on the complexity of your type system, the amount and complexity of the content annotated, how experienced the human annotators are, and other factors. For example, if the annotation task is focused on labeling parts of speech, you might expect to see a high score because of how well-defined the parts of speech are. But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-build-groundtruth"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16464-12399-14287","score":24.2239306061,"text":"\nTo determine whether different human annotators are annotating overlapping documents consistently, review the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores.\n\nKnowledge Studio calculates IAA scores by examining all overlapping documents in all document sets in the task, regardless of the status of the document sets.

The disagreement needs to be investigated and resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo set the inter-annotator agreement threshold:\n\n\n\n1. Log in as a Knowledge Studio administrator, and select your workspace.\n2. Select the Settings > IAA Settings tab.\n3. Specify a value between 0 and 1, such as .5 or .8, and then click Save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Connecting to annotation guidelines \n\nAfter you create annotation guidelines for your project, you can configure Knowledge Studio to connect to them. For help with choosing the correct annotation to apply, human annotators can review the guidelines while annotating documents. Administrators can also review the guidelines if they need assistance while resolving annotation conflicts in overlapping documents.\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo connect the ground truth editor and adjudication tool to your annotation guidelines:\n\n\n\n1. Log in as a Knowledge Studio administrator, and select your workspace.\n2. select the Settings > Annotation Guidelines tab.\n3. Specify the URL to where your guidelines are hosted.\n4. Click Save. The system connects the ground truth editor and adjudication tool to your annotation guidelines.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotate-documents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16464-10867-12930","score":17.3735359408,"text":"\n[This screen capture shows two mentions connected by the relation type, \"founderOf\".](images\/wks_tut_annotaterelation.png \"This screen capture shows two mentions connected by the relation type, \"founderOf\".\")\n\n\n\n8.

The IAA scores show how different human annotators annotated mentions, relations, and coreference chains. It is a good idea to check IAA scores periodically and verify that human annotators are consistent with each other.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-wks_tutml_intro"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16464-13891-15856","score":17.319686786,"text":"\nIn general, aim for a score of .8 out of 1, where 1 means perfect agreement.

The hash (SHA256) of the concatenated sequence is computed as a hexdigest, which is used as the LUKS passphrase to encrypt the data volume.

A goal to aim for is to eventually have at least 50 annotations for each entity type and 50 for each relation type in the document collection.\n* Again, documents should represent the breadth of the subject matter that the application will cover, but in the case of skewed frequency-of-occurrence of entity types and relation types, try to get at least 50 exemplars of each type, more for entity types that have mentions which tend to be phrases.\n* The set that you create for training must contain at least 10 annotated documents.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-documents-for-annotation"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16533-1638-3518","score":15.7240427347,"text":"\n[Overview of the process to build a machine learning model](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/50eddb8fd81f33092880335ff107a78ff5cd0f65\/watson-knowledge-studio\/images\/wks-ovw-anno.svg) Figure 1.

If a user request is received after the TTL has expired, the Edge server reaches out to the origin host to fetch the content.

This feature is supported by Akamai and cannot be turned off.\n\n\n\n\n\n Support for multiple origins with distinct paths \n\nIn certain cases, you might want to deliver certain content from a different origin server. For example, you might want certain photos or videos that are served from different origin servers. IBM Cloud CDN provides the option to set up multiple origin servers with multiple paths.

For each entry, the TTL path must be unique for the CDN. If multiple paths match a given content, the most recently configured path match applies to that content. For example, consider two TTLs, \/example\/file created first with a time to live value of 3000 seconds and \/example\/* is created later, with a value of 4000 seconds. Although \/example\/file is more specific, \/example\/ was created most recently, so the TTL for \/example\/file is 4000 seconds. After creation, TTL entries can be edited for path, time, or both.

Diverse, redundant connectivity exists at every point of the network, by using diverse telecommunication providers for the same service connectivity whenever possible within each region. Diverse dark fiber providers are used to connect every edge site to all of the regional compute facilities. Each edge site additionally has redundant backbone connectivity into other regions, and peers with multiple providers, both directly and indirectly, through a local exchange. No single event should ever result in a service disruption that is noticed by our customers.\n\nYou can always choose to \"break\" having no single point of failure with how you order or configure your SoftLayer classic servers.

All IBM Cloud applications automatically recover and restart after any disaster event. Recovery is from electronic backups at a recovery center or alternative computing facilities that restore computing. Before any potential disaster, the disaster recovery plan includes the systems and hosting requirements for hardware, software, networking connectivity, and offsite backup capabilities.\n\nThe following list includes the requirements that IBM adheres to for a disaster recovery plan:\n\n\n\n* A design document explains how load balancing is used to keep a service highly available.\n* Where multi-site failover occurs, the disaster recovery plan must explain who does what to cause the failover and ensure restart.\n* The disaster recovery plan must define how the solution works and include restore point objectives that clearly explain how much data might be lost in the outage, if any. The disaster recovery plan also includes a detailed recovery workflow for restoring services and data if a multi-availability zone failure.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01092-7-2034","score":24.3963699856,"text":"\nDisaster recovery \n\nDisaster recovery (DR) backups for IBM\u00ae Db2\u00ae Warehouse on Cloud are enabled by default and supplement daily snapshot backups.

When a regional disaster that affects all available zones occurs, ensure that all data except the master key is replicated to another region. IBM will also make additional crypto units available in a different region and manage routing requests to the new crypto units.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.11\/nodes\/pods\/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload. Priority classes can help you control the Red Hat OpenShift controller decisions to favor higher priority pods over lower priority pods. The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs). Access policies and SCCs can help prevent untrusted users from deploying high priority pods that prevent other pods from scheduling.\n\nHow does priority scheduling and preemption work?\n\nIn general, pending pods that have a higher priority are scheduled before lower prioritized pods. If you don't have enough resources remaining in your worker nodes, the Red Hat OpenShift controller can preempt (remove) pods to free up enough resources for the higher prioritized pods to be scheduled.

Red Hat OpenShift mainly automates the rotation process, but requires manual approval of certificate signing requests (CSRs). Therefore, it is important that you understand the Red Hat OpenShift certificate rotation schedule to avoid expired certificates.\n\nThe initial certificates that are created during installation expire 24 hours after they are created. IBM's automation process, which installs Red Hat OpenShift, handles the approval of the CSRs for this initial rotation, which is done by running a script on the bastion for the first 30 hours. The script is named \/root\/approve-csr.sh and its log file is named \/root\/approve-csr.log.\n\nFor the script to run successfully, the initial kubeadmin credentials must be the same until the initial certificate rotation is complete. Do not change the kubeadmin credentials for the first 24 hours. If the credentials are changed, you must monitor and approve the CSRs for the initial certificate rotation. For more information, see [Approving the CSRs for your machines](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.7\/installing\/installing_vsphere\/installing-vsphere.htmlinstallation-approve-csrs_installing-vsphere).\n\nDo not restart any of the Red Hat OpenShift cluster virtual machines (VMs) or the bastion VM until the first certificate rotation is done.\n\nAfter the initial certificate rotation, certificates are renewed every 30 days. You must establish a process to approve the CSRs for every certificate rotation. According to Red Hat\u00ae, you can approve CSRs when they reach 80% of their expiration period, which is approximately 25 days into the lifespan of the CSRs.\n\nIf you do not approve CSRs in time and the certificates expire, you can recover from expired control plane certificates and get the Red Hat OpenShift cluster operational again.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-ocp_managing"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Red Hat OpenShift mainly automates the rotation process, but requires manual approval of certificate signing requests (CSRs). Therefore, it is important that you understand the Red Hat OpenShift certificate rotation schedule to avoid expired certificates.\n\nThe initial certificates that are created during installation expire 24 hours after they are created. IBM's automation process, which installs Red Hat OpenShift, handles the approval of the CSRs for this initial rotation, which is done by running a script on the bastion for the first 30 hours. The script is named \/root\/approve-csr.sh and its log file is named \/root\/approve-csr.log.\n\nFor the script to run successfully, the initial kubeadmin credentials must be the same until the initial certificate rotation is complete. Do not change the kubeadmin credentials for the first 24 hours. If the credentials are changed, you must monitor and approve the CSRs for the initial certificate rotation. For more information, see [Approving the CSRs for your machines](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.7\/installing\/installing_vsphere\/installing-vsphere.htmlinstallation-approve-csrs_installing-vsphere).\n\nDo not restart any of the Red Hat OpenShift cluster virtual machines (VMs) or the bastion VM until the first certificate rotation is done.\n\nAfter the initial certificate rotation, certificates are renewed every 30 days. You must establish a process to approve the CSRs for every certificate rotation. According to Red Hat\u00ae, you can approve CSRs when they reach 80% of their expiration period, which is approximately 25 days into the lifespan of the CSRs.\n\nIf you do not approve CSRs in time and the certificates expire, you can recover from expired control plane certificates and get the Red Hat OpenShift cluster operational again.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-ocp_managing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10154-7-1896","score":15.0486318141,"text":"\nBenefits and service offerings \n\n[Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/products\/openshift) is an IBM Cloud service, where IBM sets up and helps you manage a cluster of worker nodes that come installed with the OpenShift Container Platform container orchestration software.\n\nTo see a list of the cluster operators that are supported by default, you can run the oc get co command.\n\n\n\n Benefits of using the service \n\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, your developers have a fast and secure way to containerize and deploy enterprise workloads in Kubernetes clusters.

This approach uses [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Container Platform Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana EFK stack](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.6\/logging\/cluster-logging.html) by installing the [Cluster Logging Operator](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.6\/logging\/cluster-logging.html).

These logs include application container logs, infrastructure component logs, and system audit logs. Administrators deploy cluster logging by deploying the Elasticsearch Operator and the Cluster Logging Operator. These operators deploy Elasticsearch servers for collecting and indexing logs, Fluentd for sending logs from worker nodes, and Kibana for searching and displaying the logs.\n\nWhen using Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud logging for financial service environments, you must install the Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator in every Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster that requires logging.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-logging-operational-tutorial"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14490-7-2135","score":19.2499930106,"text":"\nManaging Red Hat OpenShift for VMware \n\nReview the following information to manage your Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae for VMware\u00ae service after deployment.\n\n\n\n Rotating the Red Hat OpenShift certificates (required) \n\nRed Hat OpenShift for VMware uses kubelet client certificates that must be rotated periodically for security purposes. Red Hat OpenShift mainly automates the rotation process, but requires manual approval of certificate signing requests (CSRs). Therefore, it is important that you understand the Red Hat OpenShift certificate rotation schedule to avoid expired certificates.\n\nThe initial certificates that are created during installation expire 24 hours after they are created. IBM's automation process, which installs Red Hat OpenShift, handles the approval of the CSRs for this initial rotation, which is done by running a script on the bastion for the first 30 hours. The script is named \/root\/approve-csr.sh and its log file is named \/root\/approve-csr.log.\n\nFor the script to run successfully, the initial kubeadmin credentials must be the same until the initial certificate rotation is complete. Do not change the kubeadmin credentials for the first 24 hours. If the credentials are changed, you must monitor and approve the CSRs for the initial certificate rotation. For more information, see [Approving the CSRs for your machines](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.7\/installing\/installing_vsphere\/installing-vsphere.htmlinstallation-approve-csrs_installing-vsphere).\n\nDo not restart any of the Red Hat OpenShift cluster virtual machines (VMs) or the bastion VM until the first certificate rotation is done.\n\nAfter the initial certificate rotation, certificates are renewed every 30 days. You must establish a process to approve the CSRs for every certificate rotation. According to Red Hat\u00ae, you can approve CSRs when they reach 80% of their expiration period, which is approximately 25 days into the lifespan of the CSRs.\n\nIf you do not approve CSRs in time and the certificates expire, you can recover from expired control plane certificates and get the Red Hat OpenShift cluster operational again.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-ocp_managing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14492-8686-10586","score":19.2229456194,"text":"\n* Before the service is installed in your environment, a check is completed against the available capacity of the target cluster in the environment to ensure that the service components can fit.

By default, the setting is set to Normal, but it can be set to High if you encounter Kubernetes performance issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations when you delete Red Hat OpenShift for VMware \n\n\n\n* Before you delete Red Hat OpenShift for VMware, you must remove any additional VMs that you created in the ocp directory on VMware. The VMware Solutions automation removes only the items that were deployed during the initial installation of Red Hat OpenShift (VMs, storage, and NSX). Any node that is deployed after the installation is not cleaned up.\n* The VXLAN, DLR, and the Edge Gateway that were created during the initial deployment of Red Hat OpenShift for VMware is deleted. The VMs that you deployed on VXLAN will lose connectivity after the removal of Red Hat OpenShift for VMware starts.\n* If your cluster uses NFS storage, deleting Red Hat OpenShift deletes the NFS datastore that was added during installation.\n* If you are using a vSAN datastore, delete any persistent volumes that you no longer need before you uninstall Red Hat OpenShift. Any volumes that are not deleted will remain in the vSAN storage after the Red Hat OpenShift uninstallation.\n* Before you delete the service, you must remove any personal VMs that were deployed with this service, from the storage.

It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel). When the traffic is split between the VPN interface and other interfaces, split tunneling is said to be in use.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-vpn-planning"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16000-0-2579","score":18.4561851274,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Understanding Internet Communication Protocols \n\nGenerally speaking, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information. The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04122-7-1660","score":18.4345480318,"text":"\nSetting Transport Layer Security (TLS) options \n\nThe Transport Layer Security (TLS) options let you control whether visitors can browse your website over a secure connection, and when they do, how IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services connects to your origin server.\n\nUse the latest version of the TLS protocol (TLS 1.3) for improved security and performance by switching from Off to On.\n\n\n\n TLS encryption modes \n\nSet the TLS mode by selecting one of the following options from the Mode list.\n\nThese options are listed in the order from the least secure (Off) to the most secure (End-to-End CA signed).\n\n\n\n* [Off](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-off) (not recommended)\n* [Client-to-Edge](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-client-to-edge) (edge to origin not encrypted, self-signed certificates are not supported)\n* [End-to-End flexible](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-end-to-end-flexible) (edge to origin certificates can be self-signed)\n* [End-to-End CA signed](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-end-to-end-ca-signed) (default and recommended)\n* [HTTPS only origin pull](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-origin-only-pull) (Enterprise only)\n\n\n\n\n\n Off \n\nNo secure connection between your visitor and CIS, and no secure connection between CIS and your web server.

Users of the website can be sure that no one else is masquerading as the website. It is done through a public-private key pair.\n\nHyper Protect Crypto Services provides a way to offload the cryptographic operations that are done during the TLS handshake to establish a secure connection to the web server, while it keeps the TLS\/SSL private key securely stored in the dedicated HSM. In this way, you have control over your TLS\/SSL keys and processing. As a result, security is improved and reputational risk is decreased.\n\nTLS\/SSL offloading to the Hyper Protect Crypto Services HSM enables data in transit protection for web, API, and mobile transactions by using the standard PKCS #11 API.

In today\u2019s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources.

Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission\/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)\/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product\/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development).

Each Range application with a unique origin must have a unique IP address allocated, and IP addresses are a limited resource. If you need more than 10 Range applications, open an IBM Support case. Support cases to add more Range applications require a review of the use case, and the process can take a few days.\n\nYou can create more than 10 applications if they reuse an existing origin, but use different ports.\n\nFor TCP Range apps, only IP rules apply. This is because IP rules are applied to OSI Layer 3 and Layer 4. However HTTP(S) Range apps work with both firewall rules and IP rules.

We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.\n\nIn addition to maintaining our place in the conversation, the context can also contain action variables that store any other data you want to pass back and forth between your application and the assistant. This can include persistent data you want to maintain throughout the conversation (such as a customer's name or account number), or any other data you want to track (such as the contents of a shopping cart or user preferences).\n\n\n\n* Python\n* Node\n\n\n\n Example 3: Preserves context to maintain state.\n\nfrom ibm_watson import AssistantV2\nfrom ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator\n\n Create Assistant service object.\nauthenticator = IAMAuthenticator('{apikey}') replace with API key\nassistant = AssistantV2(\nversion = '2021-11-27',\nauthenticator = authenticator\n)\nassistant.set_service_url('{url}') replace with service instance URL\nassistant_id = '{environment_id}' replace with environment ID\n\n Initialize with empty message to start the conversation.\nmessage_input = {\n'message_type:': 'text',\n'text': ''\n}\ncontext = {}\n\n Initialize with empty message to start the conversation.\nmessage_input = {\n'message_type:': 'text',\n'text': ''\n}\ncontext = {}\n\n Main input\/output loop\nwhile message_input['text'] != 'quit':\n\n Send message to assistant.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16322-7-2220","score":21.8154808434,"text":"\nPhone integration context variables \n\nYou can use context variables to manage the flow of conversations with customers who interact with your assistant over the telephone.\n\nThe following tables describe the context variables that have special meaning in the context of the phone integration.

The following example illustrates how you can set a response code and response header to add a redirect to a different URL.\n\nfunction main(params) {\nreturn {\nheaders: { location: 'https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine' },\nstatusCode: 302\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Example 3: Generating a plain text response from a Function \n\nThe following example illustrates how to generate a plain text response from a Function.\n\nfunction main(params) {\nvar msg = 'You did not tell me who you are.';\nif (params.name !== \"\") {\nmsg = Hello, ${params.name}!\n}","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-work"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11852-5893-6717","score":15.8048229182,"text":"\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:20.133Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"agentOps\",\"msgid\":\"A02\",\"msg\":\"Load SATELLITE_CONNECTOR_ID value from SATELLITE_CONNECTOR_ID environment variable.\"}\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:20.138Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"agentOps\",\"msgid\":\"A01\",\"msg\":\"Load SATELLITE_CONNECTOR_IAM_APIKEY value from file \/agent-env-files\/apikey.\"}\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:20.140Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"agentOps\",\"msgid\":\"A02\",\"msg\":\"Load SATELLITE_CONNECTOR_TAGS value from SATELLITE_CONNECTOR_TAGS environment variable.\"}\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:20.141Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"agentOps\",\"msgid\":\"A02\",\"msg\":\"Load SATELLITE_CONNECTOR_REGION value from SATELLITE_CONNECTOR_REGION environment variable.\"}","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-run-agent-locally"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11852-7002-7827","score":15.7694903398,"text":"\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:20.392Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"tunneldns\",\"msgid\":\"D04\",\"msg\":\"DoTunnelDNSLookup DNS resolve c-01-ws.us-south.link.satellite.cloud.ibm.com to 169.61.31.178\"}\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:21.560Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"utilities\",\"msg\":\"MakeLinkAPICall GET \/v1\/connectors\/U2F0ZWxsaXRlQ29ubmVjdG9yOiJjaThzdWd1ZDFwZ2RrZmUxa3UxZyI status code 200\"}\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:21.563Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"agent_tunnel\",\"msgid\":\"LAT03\",\"msg\":\"Got configuration\"}\n{\"level\":30,\"time\":\"2023-06-20T16:12:21.565Z\",\"pid\":8,\"hostname\":\"6b793f671c79\",\"name\":\"agent_tunnel\",\"msgid\":\"LAT04-wss:\/\/c-01-ws.us-south.link.satellite.cloud.ibm.com\/ws\",\"msg\":\"Connecting to wss:\/\/c-01-ws.us-south.link.satellite.cloud.ibm.com\/ws\"}","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-run-agent-locally"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11755-0-1532","score":15.6047847154,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Why does host assign fail with a CRI-O error?

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03126-3707-6008","score":28.7469936237,"text":"\nUnderstanding where you will deploy the assistant before you begin can help you author the right types of answers for a given channel or platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n What languages does your assistant speak? \n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human.

In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise.

It is enabled automatically for new English-language dialog skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26 July 2019 \n\nMissing skills issue is resolved\n: In some cases, workspaces that were created through the API only were not being displayed when you opened the Watson Assistant user interface. This issue has been addressed. All workspaces that you create by using the API are displayed as dialog skills when you open the user interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 July 2019 \n\nDialog search is fixed\n: In some skills, the search function was not working in the Dialog page.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03049-7-1790","score":19.7328895486,"text":"\nAdding a dialog skill \n\nThe natural-language processing for the Watson Assistant service is defined in a dialog skill, which is a container for all of the artifacts that define a conversation flow.\n\nYou can add one dialog skill to an assistant.\n\n\n\n Create the dialog skill \n\nYou can create a skill from scratch, use a sample skill that is provided by IBM, or import a skill from a JSON file.\n\nTo add a skill, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The false value means that all available shard replicas are queried and IBM Cloudant uses the fastest response. By contrast, setting stable=true forces the database to use just one replica of the index.\n\nUsing stable=true can cause high latency as it consults only one of the copies of the index, even if the other copies would respond faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n Combining parameters \n\nIf you specify stable=false and update=false, you see greater inconsistency between results, even for the same query and without making database changes.

You can verify if a cluster does or does not use a system channel by clicking the cluster's tile and looking near the Orderer Type text.\n\nJoining an orderer to an application channel will make it either a follower or a consenter. It will be a consenter if the node is found in the the channel's config block in the consenters section. Otherwise the orderer will be a follower. Both types of orderers will receive transaction\/block data, but only a consenter can vote and play a role in the consensus algorithm. A node can be promoted from a follower to a consenter by first joining it to the channel, and then editing the channel's config to add it as a consenter. Similarly these steps can be reversed to demote an orderer and unjoin it completely if need be.\n\nJoining an orderer to the application channel can be started by clicking the cluster's tile. Next click either the plus sign on a channel tile or the Join channel blue button. Follow the prompts and select which orderer nodes to join. Then click Submit.

This is because the console does not distinguish between a deleted node and an unavailable node, and will keep an ordering node as part of its consenter set until it is removed.\n\nAs a result, when you delete a node, a check is performed to see if it is a consenter on any channels. If it is, you will not be able to delete the node until it has been removed as a consenter from all channels. After removing the node as a consenter from all channels, you will be able to delete the node by clicking the trash can icon.

If an ordering service organization was created and intended to be an administrator after the application channel was created, it must be added to the channel before any nodes belonging to it can be added as application channel consenters.\n\n\n\n* Consenter set. The ordering service nodes on a particular channel are known in a Raft consensus mechanism as a \"consenter set\". For this reason, the ordering nodes in a consenter set are sometimes referred to as \"consenters\". The orderer's system channel (when applicable) will always contain all of the possible consenters available in a network (its consenter set is \"all consenters\"), while application channels might have all consenters or some subset of consenters. It is possible to add or remove particular nodes from this consenter set during both the creation of an application channel and through a channel update. For example to add newly created orderers, if a system channel is being used they are first added to the system channel, then to the consenter set of an application channel. To add a node to the consenter set, first ensure that the organization that owns the consenter is an admin of the ordering service of the application channel through the Ordering service administrator panel. You can then add the consenter through this Consenter set panel by opening the drop-down list, clicking on a node, and clicking Add.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02900-9312-11284","score":9.8114716803,"text":"\n3.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08766-8126-10005","score":12.6889865051,"text":"\n[IBM Db2 default encryption by using the standard PKCS #11 API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/217f108cc44e2ce15fb692d4b57b4c628464e908\/hs-crypto\/\/images\/pkcs-db2.svg)\n\nFigure 5.

Block Storage for VPC volumes, snapshots, and File Storage for VPC file shares are automatically encrypted by using IBM-managed encryption. You can also choose to manage your own encryption for volumes, file shares, and custom images by using customer-managed encryption.\n\n\n\n IBM-managed encryption \n\nBy default, VPC volumes and file shares are encrypted at rest with IBM-managed encryption. The service comes with no additional cost.\n\nIBM-managed encryption uses the following industry standard protocols:\n\n\n\n* AES-256 encryption.\n* Keys are managed in-house with Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).\n* The self-encrypting drives in the Storage architecture are validated for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 Level 2.\n* Storage architecture is validated for Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n* Storage architecture is also validated for Payment Card Industry (PCI), Basel II, California Security Breach Information Act (SB 1386), and EU Data Protection Directive 95\/46\/EC compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Customer-managed encryption \n\nFor end-to-end encryption in the IBM Cloud, you can use customer-managed encryption. Your data is protected while at rest, and also in transit from the storage to the hypervisor and host. You are responsible for encrypting your data outside the VPC.\n\nWith customer-managed encryption, you can bring your own customer root key (CRK) to the cloud or have a [key management service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutkms-for-byok) (KMS) generate a key for you. Root keys are used to encrypt volume, file share, and custom image passphrases with [envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-envelope-encryption-byok), a process that wraps a key with another key.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Recently, you might have heard about Heroku changing their policy on free - the free tier. It's causing a challenge for a lot of developers out there so I want to take a handful of moments here to show you how you can migrate from Heroku to Code Engine from IBM Cloud in just a handful of steps. So let's go ahead and start playing around with it and see how quickly you can actually make your system work.\n\nSo first thing first, if you haven't seen it this is the actual line inside the official blog from Heroku, starting on November 28, 2022, we plan to stop free - offering the free product plans and plan on shutting down the free dynos and data services. We'll be sending out a series of email communications to affected users. This is challenging for a lot of beginner beginner web applications. I know for a fact personally I used Heroku when I first started back in the day so this is a pretty large hit for a lot of people and I want to show you how easy it is to convert from Heroku to Code Engine.\n\nSo first thing first, let's actually see a nice little application I've created. If I go ahead and bring up my application here, we have a nice little flask app. If you don't know what python is or flask is, it's a it's a format for python to be able to run an application on a standard port. So let's say we have this application; it says \u201cHello World!\u201d. I've already deployed it and we can check out right here We have our amazing production app at heroku.com. It says \u201chello world\u201d and we want to go ahead and change it. We wanted to update it so I'm going to go ahead and quickly update it to \u201cHello Moving from Heroku to Code Engine\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and come out of it. git add .git commit -m \u201cupdate hello line\u201d.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01078-0-2519","score":11.6266602078,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\n  Backup and restore \n\nA snapshot backup of the database is taken daily.

On each of the datastores, review the average write latency per VM. \n Review VMs with virtual devices Virtual devices such as CD or diskette drives create an overhead, therefore, remove any devices that are not needed for a VM. \n vSAN capacity advice When any capacity device in your cluster reaches 80% full, vSAN automatically rebalances the cluster until the space available on all capacity devices is lower than the threshold. The following operations can cause disk capacity to reach 80% and initiate cluster rebalancing: hardware failures, vSAN hosts are placed in maintenance mode with the Evacuate all data option, or vSAN hosts are placed in maintenance mode with Ensure data accessibility when objects assigned PFTT=0 reside on the host. To provide enough space for maintenance and reprotection, and to minimize automatic rebalancing of events in the vSAN cluster, consider keeping 30% capacity available always. \n Cluster utilization check Using vCenter, review each cluster and identify which clusters are at 50% or greater utilization for CPU and RAM. 50% is chosen as a warning level to focus attention on potential expansion of this cluster with additional hosts or clusters. The difference between 50% utilization and a maximum of 80 to 90%, is your room for additional VMs due to service requests. At the 50% limit, you should be looking at the near-future requests and forecasting when more resources need to be added. \n Cluster consolidation review Using vCenter, review each cluster and identify which clusters are at 30% or less utilization for CPU and RAM. 30% is chosen as a warning level to focus attention on potential right-sizing of this cluster by removing hosts or removing this cluster and moving VMs to another cluster. \n Right-size over-sized VMs Use a simple approach to right-size oversized VMs: identify, profile and tune, and monitor demand trends. Using vCenter identify large VMs that have the potential for right-sizing.

DevSecOps integrates a set of security and compliance controls into the DevOps processes. This feature allows organizations to deliver rapidly and often while they maintain a strong security posture and continuous state of audit-readiness.\n\nLike Agile and DevOps, DevSecOps introduces a culture change and removes the traditional barriers between Developers, Operations, and Security and Compliance officers. Development teams take greater ownership of security rather than relying on external teams to evaluate their software for security, often late in the development cycle when discovered vulnerabilities are more disruptive and expensive to remediate. The old model of having a siloed security team does not scale and does not meet the needs of a development project in a cloud-native DevOps domain. With DevSecOps, a security team's purpose evolves to more of a supportive, advising, and governance role.\n\nWith DevSecOps, developers can continue to deliver updates frequently with a minimal amount of friction. Integration of automated security scans and controls into the DevOps pipelines provides confidence with evidence to the change management process. This integration also supports automated approvals of new deployments to production when all secure criteria are met and specific checks pass. Introducing security and compliance early into the development and deployment process reduces costs and risk by identifying problems early before the software reaches a production environment. This approach is often referred to as \"shift-left\". Moreover, even if secure best practices are part of the training in every organization, developers might lack deep expertise at the security level. Applying DevSecOps and shift-left to the delivery lifecycle reduces the risk of naively releasing known vulnerabilities into production.\n\nOrganizations can take advantage of the significant benefits of using a standard set of processes for continuous integration and continuous delivery by multiple disparate teams that develop heterogeneous offerings and components. These benefits include consistency and economies of scales. When a single set of prescriptive reference pipelines that are instrumented for compliance are used for all of the components across an organization, developers spend less time to develop automation solutions and can focus on feature development.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/devsecops?topic=devsecops-devsecops_intro"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05727-12496-14915","score":11.9046222377,"text":"\nTo host the HR site, they could easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs.

You can use the \/dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the \/dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02882-27313-29495","score":14.4085613521,"text":"\nThis response type only returns a valid response if the assistant to which you added this dialog skill also has a search skill associated with it.\n\n\n\n2. Click Add response to add another response type to the current response.\n\nYou might want to add multiple response types to a single response to provide a richer answer to a user query. For example, if a user asks for store locations, you could show a map and display a button for each store location that the user can click to get address details. To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response. Meaning, if you define three conditional responses for a dialog node, each conditional response can have no more than 5 response types added to it.\n\nA single dialog node cannot have more than one Connect to human agent or more than one Search skill response.\n3.

If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant. For example, you might direct customers to your call center phone number or to an online support ticket form URL.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03054-22692-24767","score":14.0739340408,"text":"\n* Search response type: If you add a search skill response type to a dialog node, then your assistant retrieves a passage from an external data source and returns it as the response to a particular question.

For example, the dialog branch might collect information about the type of device the customer wants to buy. When you know the make and model, you can then send a model keyword in the query that is submitted to the search skill, and get better results.\n* Search skill only: If only a search skill is linked to an assistant, and no dialog skill is linked to the assistant, then a search query is sent to the Discovery service when any user input is received from one of the assistant's integration channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Test the search skill \n\nAfter you configure the search, you can send test queries to see the search results that get returned from Discovery by using the Try it out pane of the search skill.\n\nYou cannot test the full end-to-end user experience from the dialog skill's Try it out pane.

Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input. The General_About_You intent that is provided with the General content catalog serves a similar function, but its user examples are designed to focus on queries about the assistant as opposed to the business that is using the assistant to help its customers.

You want the simple assistant to answer user questions about the restaurant, its menu, and to cancel customer cake orders. Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input. The General_About_You intent that is provided with the General content catalog serves a similar function, but its user examples are designed to focus on queries about the assistant as opposed to the business that is using the assistant to help its customers. So, you will add your own intent.\n\n\n\n Add the about_restaurant intent \n\n\n\n1.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03381-2858-4802","score":30.8763925642,"text":"\n* To define your own intents, see [Defining intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents).\n\n\n\nThe dialog skill cannot interact with customers until it is added to an assistant and the assistant is deployed.

If the skill you are uploading references them in its dialog, an error is displayed. Remove these system entities from your dialog.\n* If you receive a message that says the skill contains artifacts that exceed the limits imposed by your service plan, complete the following steps to upload the skill successfully:\n\n\n\n1. Purchase a plan with higher artifact limits.\n2. Create a service instance in the new plan.\n3. Upload the skill to the new service instance.\n4. If you don't want to keep the higher-level plan, make edits to the skill such that it meets the artifact limit requirements for the plan you want to use going forward.\n\n\n\nFor information about how to decrease the number of dialog nodes, see [How many nodes are in my dialog?](\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasksdialog-tasks-count-nodes).\n\n\n\n1.

It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16364-98714-100707","score":18.6201613724,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Adding service desk support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-haa).\n\nAutolearning has been moved and improved\n: Go to the Analytics>Autolearning page to enable the feature and see visualizations that illustrate how autolearning impacts your assistant's performance over time.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04107-9120-10897","score":9.0648562382,"text":"\nCIS WAF contains rulesets to mitigate non-volumetric attacks, including cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection.

Every pre-production destination added to your Event Notifications instance incurs the fee.\n\nA production destination instance fee is also charged monthly and allows unlimited devices and outbound messages.\n\nIf you change a pre-production destination to a production destination, the charges for the transition month would be the pre-producdtion fee + pro-rated charge for the production instance.\n\nFor example, assume the pre-production instance fee is $15 per month and the production instance fee is $50 per month.\n\nThese prices are assumed for this example only. Current pricing may be different from the amounts shown in the example. See the Event Notifications catalog page for current pricing.\n\n\n\n* As of 31 July, you create a pre-production destination and does not register any devices or send messages, the charges for July will be $15.\n* As of 1 August, you register 500 devices and 5001 messages sent. The charges for August will be $30 (This is due to the message threshold exceeds the permitted limit.)\n* As of 5 August, you change from pre-production destination to production destination.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-push"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

We then create an instance of the library that is configured with the credentials we stored in the first line. We use the IBM Cloudant object to get a reference to the books database and store it in a variable database. We haven't made any API calls - only created data structures that store credentials and which database that we are working on.

Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human.

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-index"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07080-6045-7467","score":28.9565032769,"text":"\n[checkbox](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8\/discovery-data\/images\/checkbox.png) Deploy your solution.

These features are available for both the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.\n\nThe features involve the use of elements of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). The descriptions of the features provide information about how they interact with related SSML elements and attributes.\n\n\n\n Using speaking styles \n\nThe expressive neural voices determine the sentiment of the text from the context of its words and phrases. The speech that they produce, in addition to having a very conversational style, reflects the mood of the text. The expressive voices naturally express gratitude, thankfulness, happiness, empathy, confusion, and other sentiments by default, with no explicit additional tagging.\n\nHowever, you can embellish the voices' natural tendencies by using the <express-as> element with the required style attribute to indicate that all or some of the text is to emphasize specific characteristics. These characteristics are referred to as speaking styles:\n\n\n\n* cheerful - Expresses happiness and good news. The style is upbeat, welcoming, and conveys a positive message.\n* empathetic - Expresses empathy and compassion. The style has sympathetic undertones, but it is not excessively sorrowful.\n* neutral - Expresses objectivity and evenness. The style strives for less emotion, and instead conveys a more even and instructional tone.\n* uncertain - Expresses uncertainty and confusion. The style conveys the feeling of being unsure or in doubt.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the effect of the styles is very subtle. In such cases, the differences might not be readily discernible from the default expressive tone. But there are instances where the style can audibly enhance the voices' inherent ability to detect and express emotion. The differences are often detectable only on certain words and phrases.\n\nTable 1 provides examples of each available style for the <express-as> element. To demonstrate the effect of the styles, the table provides two samples for each example.

The parameters specify the service's sensitivity to non-speech events and to background noise. The parameters are independent: You can use them individually or together.\n\nSpeech activity detection is supported for most language models. For more information, see [Language model support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-inputdetection-support).\n\n\n\n How speech activity detection works \n\nSpeech activity detection consumes the input audio stream and determines which parts of the stream to pass for speech recognition. Speech recognition is adversely affected by background speech and noise, causing the service to transcribe the wrong words, to produce words where none are present, or to omit words that are part of the input audio. The speech activity detection feature can help ensure that only relevant audio is processed for speech recognition.\n\nYou can use the feature to control the following aspects of speech recognition:\n\n\n\n* Suppress background speech. Call-center data often contains cross-talk (\"overhearing\") from other agents. You can set a volume threshold below which such background speech is ignored.\n* Suppress background noise. Some audio, such as speech recorded in a factory, can contain a high level of background noise. You can set a threshold below which such background noise is ignored.\n* Suppress non-speech audio events. Background music and tone events, such as audio played to a client who is waiting on hold on a telephone line, can cause inaccurate recognition. Silence can also result in unnecessary recognition or transcription errors. You can set a threshold below which such events are ignored.\n\n\n\nBy default, speech activity detection is configured to provide optimal performance for the general case for each model. For specific cases, the default settings might not be optimal and can lead either to slow transcription or to word insertions and deletions. You are encouraged to experiment with different settings to determine which values work best for your audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity \n\nUse the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter to adjust the sensitivity of speech activity detection.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16364-192793-195089","score":13.4896675839,"text":"\nThe name you specify is saved as a title attribute of the node in the workspace JSON file and the system uses a unique ID that is stored in the name attribute to reference the node.\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 August 2017 \n\nUpdates to Korean, Japanese, and Italian\n: Language support has been enhanced for Korean, Japanese, and Italian.

Before proceeding onto the next section, review [Recommended Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology (RSCT) package levels for imported AIX images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-recommended-rsct-package).\n\n\n\n Defining an AIX Helper VM \n\nYou can use an existing AIX VM to copy an AIX mksysb archive. The alt_disk_mksysb command copies the mksysb archive onto a new volume. The alt_disk_mksysb command also gives you the option of rebooting from a specific disk image.\n\nBefore you can copy an AIX mksysb archive, determine the amount of space the helper VM needs to hold the mksysb image. In the following example, the mksysb image (gdrh10v1.sysb) is roughly 5.8 GB. Determining the space needed as follow:\n\n:>ls -l gdrh10v1.sysb\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root system 5806899200 Jul 18 2017 gdrh10v1.sysb\n\nNext, you must identify a helper VM file system with enough space to hold the mksysb image. If such a file system does not exist, you can attach a data volume as a staging area. To display information about a volume group, use the lsvg command.\n\n lsvg rootvg\nVOLUME GROUP: rootvg VG IDENTIFIER: 00f6db0a00004c000000016b94f02\nVG STATE: active PP SIZE: 32 megabyte(s)\nVG PERMISSION: read\/write TOTAL PPs: 639 (20448 megabytes)\nMAX LVs: 256 FREE PPs: 477 (15264 megabytes)\nLVs: 12 USED PPs: 162 (5184 megabytes)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-restoring-aix-mksysb-image"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11421-1359-2601","score":16.4777170328,"text":"\nVOLUME GROUP: rootvg VG IDENTIFIER: 00f6db0a00004c000000016b94f02\nVG STATE: active PP SIZE: 32 megabyte(s)\nVG PERMISSION: read\/write TOTAL PPs: 639 (20448 megabytes)\nMAX LVs: 256 FREE PPs: 477 (15264 megabytes)\nLVs: 12 USED PPs: 162 (5184 megabytes)\nOPEN LVs: 11 QUORUM: 2 (Enabled)\nTOTAL PVs: 1 VG DESCRIPTIORS: 2\nSTALE PVs: 0 STALE PPs: 0\nACTIVE PVs: 1 AUTO ON: yes\nMAX PPs per VG: 32512\nMAX PPs per PV: 1016 MAX PVs: 32\nLTG size(Dynamic): 512 kilobyte(s) AUTO SYNC: no\nHOT SPARE: no BB POLICY: relocatable\nPV RESTRICTION: none INFINITE RETRY: no\nDISK BLOCK SIZE: 512 CRITICAL VG: no\nFS SYNC OPTION: no CRITICAL PVs: no\n\nShow more\n\nRunning the df -g command displays information about the total space and available space on a file system.

MFA is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA).\n\nThe following two types of MFA options might be enabled for your account:\n\nID-based MFA\n: ID-based MFA is the preferred method for requiring MFA in an account. This type of MFA is associated with each users' ID and authenticates them across all accounts that they are a member of, so they authenticate only one time. This type of MFA overrides the legacy account-based MFA options.\n: ID-based MFA applies to all resources in any type of account. When ID-based MFA is enabled, a user is prompted to provide a unique identifier (such as a username or email) and a one-time password (OTP) generated by an authenticator app or a hardware token. After the correct OTP is entered, access is granted to the requested resource. This type of MFA is much more secure than account-based MFA because it is not limited to classic infrastructure resources and applies to all resources within the account. It also reduces the risk of a breach because of a weak password or the use of the same password across multiple accounts.\n\nAccount-based MFA\n:\nClassic infrastructure\n\nAccount-based MFA applies only to classic infrastructure and not to other resources in your account. Unlike with ID-based MFA, legacy MFA options, such as security questions, are enforced only on the specific account where the MFA is enabled. If you have a different legacy MFA option set up for each account that you are a member of, you must authenticate in a different way each time that you switch accounts.\n\nLegacy account-based MFA was available to accounts with classic infrastructure prior to the release of ID-based MFA. This legacy offering continues to work for accounts with classic infrastructure and requires the user to provide a secondary authentication input when logging in or switching to accounts with classic infrastructure. Non-classic resources are not secured by this legacy offering. ID-based MFA is for customers that want to implement MFA to secure the full range of IBM Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n ID-based MFA options","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-types"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.2371977128,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2371977128}}

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":27.7831027542,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":24.2448561458,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04118-5438-6061","score":22.4862739978,"text":"\nAdvanced rate limiting No No Yes Yes Yes \n Bot management No No No Yes No \n\n\n\n\n\n Deprecated plans \n\nThe following plans are scheduled for deprecation or deprecated.\n\n\n\n* The Standard plan reached the end of marketing on 30 April 2023.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with \/cdn-cgi\/challenge-platform\/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04111-35313-36062","score":21.0769479296,"text":"\nGet Bot Management settings.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":20.9859794087,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

The TLS\/SSL protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications.\n\nIn the context of web servers, the TLS\/SSL protocol allows a website to establish the identity. Users of the website can be sure that no one else is masquerading as the website. It is done through a public-private key pair.\n\nHyper Protect Crypto Services provides a way to offload the cryptographic operations that are done during the TLS handshake to establish a secure connection to the web server, while it keeps the TLS\/SSL private key securely stored in the dedicated HSM. In this way, you have control over your TLS\/SSL keys and processing. As a result, security is improved and reputational risk is decreased.\n\nTLS\/SSL offloading to the Hyper Protect Crypto Services HSM enables data in transit protection for web, API, and mobile transactions by using the standard PKCS #11 API. With Hyper Protect Crypto Services, you can integrate TLS\/SSL offloading with other cloud proxies.\n\nFor a tutorial on how to offload the SSL workload to a load balancer such as NGINX while managing keys by using Hyper Protect Crypto Services, see [Using IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services to offload NGINX TLS](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/components\/ibmz\/tutorials\/use-hyper-protect-crypto-services-to-offload-nginx-tls\/).\n\nZoom\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-use-cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09105-6159-7945","score":17.6630400993,"text":"\n<br> <br>When you set the return_preference variable to return=minimal, the service returns only the key metadata, such as the key name and ID value, in the response entity-body.

You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01494-97628-98949","score":24.0532587424,"text":"\n* [Do I have any untagged images?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_untagged_image_1)\n* [Do I need untagged images?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_untagged_image_2)\n* [What are eligible images?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_eligible_image)\n* [What regions are available?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_regions)\n\n\n\n* [Frequently asked questions about Vulnerability Advisor](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqregistry_faq_va)\n\n\n\n* [How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_va_cost)\n* [Can images from other registries be scanned?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_va_reg)\n* [How is a Vulnerability Advisor scan triggered?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_va_trigger_scan)\n* [Why doesn't a new image scan?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_va_new_scan_error)\n* [How often are the security notices updated?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faqfaq_va_update_security_notice)\n* [Why can I see a vulnerability in Vulnerability Advisor v4 but not in v3?]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-sitemap"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10439-40150-42016","score":22.5804313389,"text":"\nAs you plan how many Service objects you need in your cluster, keep in mind that Kubernetes uses iptables to handle networking and port forwarding rules.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01471-37693-39572","score":18.4062185777,"text":"\nYou can use the new region by using the domain name jp.icr.io.\n\nFor more information, see [Regions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_regions).\n\n\n\n\n\n 21 February 2019 \n\nAutomating access to your namespaces\n: Using tokens to automate pushing and pulling Docker images to and from your namespaces is deprecated.

The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another.

The version that you upload is not applied to your cluster until you add a subscription to your configuration. \n Subscription A Satellite subscription specifies which Kubernetes resource is deployed to one or more cluster groups. After you create the subscription, Satellite Config automatically downloads the Kubernetes resource that you specified and starts applying it across all clusters that belong to the cluster group.

Such words are referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The service adds OOV words to the custom model's words resource. The purpose of the words resource is to define words that are not already present in the service's vocabulary.\n\nDefinitions in the words resource tell the service how to transcribe the OOV words. The information includes a sounds_like field that tells the service how the word is pronounced, a display_as field that tells the service how to display the word, and a source field that indicates how the word was added to the custom model. For more information about the words resource and OOV words, see [The words resource](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-corporaWordswordsResource).\n\nAfter you add a grammar to a custom model, it is good practice to examine the OOV words in the model's words resource to verify their sounds-like pronunciations. Not all grammars have OOV words, but verifying the words resource is generally a good idea. To check the words of the custom model after you add a grammar, use the following methods:\n\n\n\n* Use the GET \/v1\/customizations\/{customization_id}\/words method to list all of the words from a custom model.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues.

The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16321-19290-20983","score":38.2469990767,"text":"\n\"uri\": \"sip:12345556789\\@myhost.com\"\n\n\n\n Transferring after hangup \n\nBy default, the phone integration transfers calls by using a SIP REFER request. Depending on the IVR service provider, you might need to configure call transfer to use a SIP BYE request instead. Use the transfer_method attribute to specify how to transfer the call, using either refer or hangup. When transfer_method is set to hangup instead of refer, the behavior of the transfer action changes. Instead of sending a SIP REFER request, the phone integration plays back any associated text and then hangs up the call by sending a SIP BYE request.\n\nAfter the hangup, the phone integration passes the transfer destination that is specified in the url attribute to the call anchor in the BYE message. The header field that contains the transfer target is determined by the transfer_target_header attribute.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03312-5487-7760","score":33.3921029969,"text":"\nIf a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time.

Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region.

What's your name?\n>> Robert\nI'm afraid I don't understand. Please rephrase your question.\n>> I want to make an appointment.\nWhat day would you like to come in?\n>> Thursday\nI'm afraid I don't understand. Please rephrase your question.\n>>\n\nThe assistant is starting out with the correct greeting, but it doesn't understand when you tell it your name. And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16034-7-1778","score":10.8767500952,"text":"\nVPC CLI release

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07844-2925-4586","score":14.3820537552,"text":"\nRA-5 (a) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br>","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1213887-1215935","score":14.0023834004,"text":"\nAfter you delete your Key Protect instance, Key Protect uses[envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption) to crypto-shred any data that is associated with the Key Protect instance.\n* Why does the user interface show unauthorized access?\n\nSetting and retrieving the network access policy is only supported through the application programming interface (API).

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03107-4-1607","score":17.1841209084,"text":"\nThis documentation for the classic Watson Assistant experience has moved.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-15662-16934","score":15.2740307245,"text":"\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days.

You can purchase and manage bandwidth metering for classic in two ways, through metering on individual devices, or through collective-metering when you add a device to a bandwidth pool.\n\nAll inbound and outbound bandwidth inside the IBM Cloud Classic infrastructure is unlimited and cost-free for your servers' use. Public egress bandwidth is charged on a tiered basis, with a set allocation for each month of your servers' use.\n\nBandwidth usage is measured as egress traffic on a device's public interfaces.\n\nBandwidth allocations are reserved for all public egress network usage. Devices with individual bandwidth metering and pool-based metering are all measured unless the device is ordered on the private network only.\n\nBandwidth allocation is a threshold where usage below the threshold is free or included, while usage in excess of the threshold is billed as a bandwidth overage. Bandwidth overages are billed individually per server or device, unless they participate in a bandwidth pool.\n\nDevices added to a bandwidth pool contribute both their bandwidth allocation and bandwidth usage to form aggregated totals for the pool. If the pool usage exceeds the total pool allocation, the account owner is billed a consolidated pool overage fee.\n\n\n\n About device bandwidth \n\nYou can manage each device's bandwidth allocation. When you provision certain devices, you can select the amount of bandwidth that you want to allocate to that device. For each device, you pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth allocation during a billing cycle, and receive a notification when the device is at risk of overage for the billing cycle.

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

This page reflects only classic infrastructure charges. To view your official invoice and for any pricing inquiries, visit IBM Invoices. To sign up and view your invoices, you must provide your IBM customer number. If you don't know your customer number, contact IBM Cloud Support by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option.\n\nIn this situation, go to [Invoices@IBM](http:\/\/ibm.com\/invoices) to review your upcoming invoice, past invoices, or details about service charges.\n\n\n\n  Invoicing for different account types \n\nDepending on your account type, your usage is incurred and reflected differently on your invoice.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) charges aren't included.\n\n\n\nThird-party services, such as SendGrid, don't bill for their service through IBM Cloud if you signed up for their service outside of IBM Cloud.\n\nAn IBM Cloud service might provide a free allocation before the start of your billing period. To determine whether your service instance provides a free allocation, go to the [Resources list](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/resources) in the IBM Cloud console. Click the service name, and then click Plan. Review the feature description for each plan to see whether the service offers free allocations.

For these interactions to be verifiable (to ensure, in other words, who is who) requires identities and a system of permissions that can be checked during each interaction. You can think of the kind of identity that is needed as being similar to a credit card in that it identifies someone within a particular context. Credit cards identify an individual in terms of banking transactions, while Fabric identities allow users to be identified in a blockchain context.\n\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, as well as the IBM Blockchain Platform, this component is the Certificate Authority (CA), which creates identities in the form of x509 certificates as well defining of an organization through the creation of a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines the permissions of identities at a component and channel level. These identities can include attributes about them, for example, by linking them to a particular organization or organizational unit (OU).\n\nAn organization MSP, for example, has an MSP subfolder called admins. Any user whose certificate is inside that admin folder is an admin of the organization. Because this MSP defines the organization, it is listed in the configuration on every channel of which the organization is a member. As a result, whenever an admin of the organization tries to perform an action, the signing certificate of the admin (which is attached to all of its interactions) is checked against the certificates listed in the MSP. Does the certificate match the one listed in the channel configuration? If it does, the other organizations will validate it and the action can be performed. If not, the request to execute the transaction is rejected.\n\nIBM Blockchain Platform CAs are based on the [Hyperledger Fabric CA](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-1.4\/), though it is possible to use another CA if it uses a PKI based on x.509 certificates. Because non-Fabric CAs are not configured to create properly formatted MSPs, users who want to use this kind of CA must create the MSP for themselves.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-blockchain-component-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1068305-1070191","score":30.4790670313,"text":"\nYou can request to cancel your subscription before the end of the term, but whether the subscription can be canceled is at the discretion of IBM.
