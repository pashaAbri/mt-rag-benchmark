Nor is it true that during every full moon , the Earth 's shadow falls on the Moon , causing a lunar eclipse . Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed every month because the plane of the Moon 's orbit around the Earth is tilted by about 5 \u00b0 with respect to the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun ( the plane of the ecliptic ) . Thus , when new and full moons occur , the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun .

The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions . Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington 's gene . At that time surveys indicated that 50 -- 70 % of at - risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing , but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested . Over 95 % of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing , mostly because there is no treatment . A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD , compared to the impact of a positive result . Irrespective of the result , stress levels have been found to be lower two years after being tested , but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result . Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected . Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result , which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual 's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it . In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46 % of individuals at risk for Huntington 's disease . It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations . Genetic counseling in HD can provide information , advice and support for initial decision - making , and then , if chosen , throughout all stages of the testing process .

After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons . Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops , but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation . The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks . Marine pilots , like all aviators , fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority ; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops . On the other hand , the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own . Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces ; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield . The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards ahead . In 1944 , after considerable internal acrimony , Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out . At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party ( ALP ) not only requested air support , but actually directed it in tactical detail . The Marine formula increased responsiveness , reduced `` friendly '' casualties , and ( flying weather permitting ) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery . For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation , provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed - wing fighters or bombers , although the Army was allowed to have some unarmed transports and spotter planes .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America .

One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea , leading people to think they had originated there . `` Guinea '' was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far - off , unknown country , so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal 's exotic appeal . Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America . A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 . Others believe `` guinea '' may be an alteration of the word coney ( rabbit ) ; guinea pigs were referred to as `` pig coneys '' in Edward Topsell 's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_8563-10133-0-1570", "score": 31.470730184892673, "text": "Guinea pig\nSpanish , Dutch , and English traders brought guinea pigs to Europe , where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty , including Queen Elizabeth I . The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages , through the era of the Poets of the Princes ( c. 1100 -- 1280 ) and then the Poets of the Gentry ( c. 1350 -- 1650 ) . The Poets of the Princes were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to the Welsh princes while the Poets of the Gentry were a school of poets that favoured the cywydd metre . The period is notable for producing one of Wales ' greatest poets , Dafydd ap Gwilym . After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined .

The manuscript of Gawain is known in academic circles as Cotton Nero A.x. , following a naming system used by one of its owners , Robert Cotton , a collector of Medieval English texts . Before the Gawain manuscript came into Cotton 's possession , it was in the library of Henry Savile of Banke in Yorkshire . Little is known about its previous ownership , and until 1824 , when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of Thomas Warton 's History edited by Richard Price , it was almost entirely unknown . Even then , the Gawain poem was not published in its entirety until 1839 . Now held in the British Library , it has been dated to the late 14th century , meaning the poet was a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer , author of The Canterbury Tales , though it is unlikely that they ever met . The three other works found in the same manuscript as Gawain ( commonly known as Pearl , Patience , and Purity or Cleanliness ) are often considered to be written by the same author . However , the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet .

It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur . From around the seventh century , the connection between Wales and the Old North was lost , and the focus of Welsh - language culture shifted to Wales , where Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth . Wales 's most celebrated medieval poet , Dafydd ap Gwilym ( fl. 1320 -- 1370 ) , composed poetry on themes including nature , religion and especially love . He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age . Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character . Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh - language novelist , publishing Rhys Lewis in 1885 . The best - known of the Anglo - Welsh poets are both Thomases . Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century .

In addition , a number of Cummings ' poems feature , in part or in whole , intentional misspellings , and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects . Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words , as in `` in Just '' which features words such as `` mud - luscious '' , `` puddle - wonderful '' , and `` eddieandbill . '' This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled Chansons Innocentes ; it has many references comparing the `` balloonman '' to Pan , the mythical creature that is half - goat and half - man . Literary critic R.P. Blackmur has commented that this use of language is `` frequently unintelligible because he ( Cummings ) disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_7094-7305-0-211", "score": 33.14634874637105, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2006 MLS All - Star Game August 5 , 2006 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 0 Chelsea ( show ) Toyota Park , Bridgeview , Illinois De Rosario 70 ' Report Attendance : 21,210 Referee : Abbey Okulaja MVP : Dwayne De Rosario MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_7327-7564-0-235", "score": 32.606456387428736, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2007 MLS All - Star Game July 19 , 2007 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 0 Celtic ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado \u00c1ngel 36 ' Toja 44 ' Report Attendance : 18,661 Referee : Baldomero Toledo MVP : Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_9393-9642-0-249", "score": 32.606456387428736, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2014 MLS All - Star Game August 6 , 2014 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 1 Bayern Munich ( show ) Providence Park , Portland , Oregon Wright - Phillips 51 ' Donovan 70 ' Report Lewandowski 8 ' Attendance : 21,733 Referee : Jair Marrufo MVP : Landon Donovan MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_9951-10190-0-239", "score": 32.47426611038423, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2016 MLS All - Star Game July 28 , 2016 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 2 Arsenal ( show ) Avaya Stadium , San Jose , California Drogba 45 + 2 ' Report Campbell 10 ' ( pen . ) Akpom 87 ' Attendance : 18,000 Referee : Chris Penso MVP : Chuba Akpom MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_5905-6162-0-257", "score": 32.34316101582361, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2002 MLS All - Star Game August 3 , 2002 MLS All - Stars 3 -- 2 United States ( show ) RFK Stadium , Washington , D.C.

Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz had and was headed by bandleaders that tightly arranged the material , discouraging the improvisation that had been an integral part of jazz .

However , high - dose supplementation of pregnant women should be avoided because it can cause miscarriage and birth defects . Food fortification is also useful for improving VAD . A variety of oily and dry forms of the retinol esters , retinyl acetates and retinyl palmitate are available for food fortification of vitamin A. Margarine and oil are the ideal food vehicles for vitamin A fortification . They protect vitamin A from oxidation during storage and prompt absorption of vitamin A.

An Infinity Gauntlet prop was released , followed by a different Gem each month . Each Gem can be added the Gauntlet , increasing its power in game . The Gems can be displayed on a stand that comes with the Gauntlet or on each Elder that Thanos encountered in the story Thanos Quest . Replica Infinity Gauntlets were given out as trophies at Ultimate Fighting Game Tournament 8 , a 2012 Road to Evo tournament .

In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson 's breasts in an alleged `` wardrobe malfunction '' , all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group , with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s . These shows were considered `` family friendly '' and the time in which they took place has been described as `` the age of reactionary halftime shows .

The difference in neuroticism was the most prominent and consistent , with significant differences found in 49 of the 55 nations surveyed . Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous , healthy , and more gender - egalitarian cultures . A plausible explanation for this is that acts by women in individualistic , egalitarian countries are more likely to be attributed to their personality , rather than being attributed to ascribed gender roles within collectivist , traditional countries . Differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were due to differences between men , not women , in these respective regions . That is , men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic , extraverted , conscientious and agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions . Women , on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions . The most simple explanation for this gender data is that women remain relatively resource - poor , regardless of the circumstances of males within a first - world country . However , the authors of this study speculated that resource - poor environments ( that is , countries with low levels of development ) may inhibit the development of gender differences , whereas resource - rich environments facilitate them . This may be because males require more resources than females in order to reach their full developmental potential . The authors also argued that due to different evolutionary pressures , men may have evolved to be more risk taking and socially dominant , whereas women evolved to be more cautious and nurturing . Ancient hunter - gatherer societies may have been more egalitarian than later agriculturally oriented societies . Hence , the development of gender inequalities may have acted to constrain the development of gender differences in personality that originally evolved in hunter - gatherer societies . As modern societies have become more egalitarian , again , it may be that innate sex differences are no longer constrained and hence manifest more fully than in less - developed cultures . Currently , this hypothesis remains untested , as gender differences in modern societies have not been compared with those in hunter - gatherer societies .", "title": "Big Five personality traits", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836832530_341-1051-0-709", "score": 15.329234478677574, "text": "Tequila\nTequila ( Spanish pronunciation : ( te\u02c8kila ) ( listen ) ) is a regional distilled beverage and type of alcoholic drink made from the blue agave plant , primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila , 65 km ( 40 mi ) northwest of Guadalajara , and in the highlands ( Los Altos ) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco .

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

In legend , the tribes of Gog and Magog were said to have been locked out by Alexander the Great with walls of steel .

The work A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions by Gaspar da Cruz ( c. 1520 -- 70 ) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted , `` a Wall of an hundred leagues in length . And some will affirme to bee more than a hundred leagues . '' Another early account written by Bishop Juan Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza ( 1550 -- 1620 ) reported a wall five hundred leagues long , but suggested that only one hundred leagues were man - made , with the rest natural rock formations .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

Karen Thomas of USA Today dubbed Aniston `` our favorite Friend '' . According to Turner Classic Movies , Aniston ultimately became `` One of the most popular television actresses of her era '' . According to Jennifer Aniston : From Friends to Films author Kim Etingoff , the actress ' own fame `` outshone '' those of her co-stars , becoming the first cast member to `` rise to prominence '' ; the actress continues to experience the most post-Friends success . Aniston 's performance in Friends led to a successful film career . According to The Inquisitr News , Rachel is `` the role that would end up launching ( Aniston 's ) success '' , while Bradford Evans of Splitsider believes `` that Jennifer Aniston likely would n't have become a major movie star without Friends '' . While ranking Aniston the most attractive sitcom star of the 1990s , Josh Robertson of Complex magazine wrote that `` With the haircut , the TV fame , and a true gift for comedy ... combined , Aniston became a big star '' , replacing Cox as the show 's `` established hottie '' . According to Steve Charnock of Yahoo ! Movies , Aniston is `` the series ' only main cast member to become a bona fide movie star since the end of the show '' . While agreeing that Aniston 's film career has been successful , several critics believe that the actress ' filmography remains limited to playing Rachel - like roles in romantic comedies , save for some exceptions . Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian noted that `` Consequently , many of Aniston 's movie roles ... have been Rachel in all but name . '' Andrew Collins of Radio Times agreed , writing that Aniston `` seems trapped , perpetually playing variations of Rachel '' . According to TV Guide , Aniston is `` usually called upon to play a variation of her neurotic and adorable Friends character '' .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel . '' Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position . The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends .

The episode that would ultimately transform the friends ' relationship for the remainder of the series was the first - season finale `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' , in which Rachel finally learns of Ross ' true feelings for her , at the same time discovering she actually feels the same . However , the episode nearly went unwritten because , at the time , few Friends writers were expecting the couple 's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became . The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows ; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple 's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive `` he 's pining , she 's oblivious '' pattern , using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel . Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high , `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' became Friends ' most reworked episode . The couple 's first kiss at the end of season two 's `` The One Where Ross Finds Out '' was met with deafening applause from the studio audience . Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging . Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by `` dangl ( ing ) the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together .

Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after G\u00fcnter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi .

It was therefore the collapse of international liquidity that caused the contraction of trade ( 8 ) , not customs tariffs . Second , domestic output in the major industrialized countries fell faster than international trade contracted , so it was not the contraction in foreign trade that caused the depression , but rather the reverse ( it was the fall in domestic demand in the countries that caused the contraction in foreign trade ) . This indicates that it is the domestic growth of countries that generate foreign trade , not the reverse .

Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland , but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe , which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany . Germany itself would not be dismembered , but would be jointly occupied by the United States , France , Britain , and the Soviet Union . Against Soviet pressure , Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war . Roosevelt 's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial ; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe , while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war .

American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly progress called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands , with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded . In contrast to Hitler , Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations , though he approved strategic decisions . Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan , but he always insisted on Germany first . The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf , and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific .

The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade .

Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade .

Over this period , the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India , importing these from Britain 's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations , while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms , and of agricultural exports from India . Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade . In London , the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India , and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire .
