These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-1160-2754","score":0.7075728774,"text":"\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/depmodels\/cloud\/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/training\/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/35-Connectivity.svg)](https:\/\/community.ibm.com\/community\/user\/publiccloud\/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00556-10831-12062","score":0.6778296232,"text":"\nThe content must be provided by using [BASE64](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Base64) representation, as shown in the example.\n\nA full list of media types is available in the [media types](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Internet_media_typeList_of_common_media_types) article.\n\nSee the following example JSON document that includes an inline attachment of a jpeg image:\n\n{\n\"_id\":\"document_with_attachment\",\n\"_attachments\":\n{\n\"name_of_attachment\": {\n\"content_type\":\"image\/jpeg\",\n\"data\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAA... ...AASUVORK5CYII=\"\n}\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Performance considerations \n\nWhile document attachments are useful, they do have implications for application performance. In particular, having too many attachments can have an adverse performance impact during replication.\n\nFor example, if your application requires storage for multiple images as attachments or includes large images, you must use an alternative [BLOB](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Binary_large_object) storage mechanism to store the images. You might then use IBM Cloudant to keep the image metadata, such as URLs to the BLOB store.\n\nYou might find it helpful to do performance testing for your specific application to determine which approach works best for your circumstances.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-3-1515","score":0.6774859428,"text":"\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB docs \n\nMongoDB is a JSON document store with a rich query and aggregation framework.\n\n Developer tools \n\n[API & SDK reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloud-databases-api\/cloud-databases-api-v5introduction)[CLI reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/databases-cli-plugin)[Terraform reference](https:\/\/registry.terraform.io\/providers\/IBM-Cloud\/ibm\/latest\/docs\/resources\/database)\n\n Recommended content \n\n[Getting Started A brief tutorial to introduce using an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB deployment.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-getting-started)[Setting the Admin Password The IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB service is provisioned with a admin user.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00620-9537-11012","score":0.6748430729,"text":"\nHowever, in a real application, the page size might be different and depends on document size, latency demands, memory consumption, and other tradeoffs.You can use the options that are described in the following sections.<-- <section \"id=\"section-option-1-fetch-one-doc-too-many\" \"> --> Option 1 - Fetch one document too many Instead of fetching five documents (limit=5), fetch 5+1 (limit=6), but hide the sixth document from your users.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1\/icons\/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

For example, you might want to send an email inviting customers to update their account information; you can include a link that opens the web chat on your site and sends the initial message I want to update my account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-release-notes-chat"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":0.6618916988,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16380-1665-3330","score":0.6881992817,"text":"\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2.

By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Issues with network connectivity can cause delays for your project if you do not plan properly, regardless of how you plan to use your system.\n\nIn general, IBM Cloud VPC has a highly available, high-bandwidth network that is connected to every compute resource, be it bare metal servers or physical servers, which, in the VSI case, serve a hypervisor. Each physical server (host), which serves a hypervisor, divides the network into virtual network interfaces (vNICs) that are attached to the virtual server.\n\nDepending on the profile of your virtual server, the total available network bandwidth to the virtual server is in the range of 4 Gbps to 64 Gbps. It's important to consider that each vNIC has a maximum throughput of 16 Gbps, so to achieve maximum throughput, up to 4 additional vNICs must be attached to the virtual server (that is, a virtual server might have a maximum of 5 vNICs attached).\n\nIf you need to connect to your virtual or bare metal server through the public internet (also known as inbound to a server), you can order a Floating IP and attach to the server's vNIC, in other words: you can attach one Floating IP per server.\n\nIf you want to connect to the public internet from your server (also known as outbound from a server), you need to attach a Public Gateway to the VPC. This gateway provides access to the internet for an entire subnet.\n\nThe following inter-connectivity options are available:\n\n\n\n* VPC zone to zone,\n* VPC to VPC,\n* VPC to Classic Infrastructure,\n* VPC to IBM Power Systems Infrastructure,\n* VPC to on-premises data centers by using a VPC VPN Gateway\n\n\n\nWhen a connection to the public internet is not acceptable because of security measures, you can deploy an IPsec Gateway into your VPC to connect to your server.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sap?topic=sap-vpc-env-introduction"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13079-7-2117","score":0.6621282101,"text":"\nFAQs \n\nYou can read the following FAQs to help you with Hyper Protect Virtual Servers.\n\n\n\n Are there any backup functions provided for a virtual server? \n\nHyper Protect Virtual Servers does not provide any backup functions for your virtual server instances.

Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13904-0-1404","score":0.6591427922,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Configuring services \n\nThere are a variety of services running on the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Router Appliance (VRA) that can be configured.\n\nThey include:\n\nvyatta@vrouter set service\n\nPossible completions include:\n\n> connsync        Connection tracking synchronization (conn-sync) service\n> dhcp-relay      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay agent\n> dhcp-server     Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for DHCP server\n> dhcpv6-relay    DHCPv6 Relay Agent parameters\n> dhcpv6-server   DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6) server\n> dns             Domain Name Server (DNS) parameters\n> flow-monitoring Flow-Monitoring traffic monitoring configuration\n> https           Enable\/disable the Web server\n> lldp            LLDP settings\n> nat             Network Address Translation (NAT)\n> netconf         NETCONF (RFC 6241)\n> portmonitor     Portmonitor configuration\n> sflow           sflow configuration for dataplane\n> snmp            Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\n> ssh             Secure Shell (SSH) protocol\n> telnet          Enable\/disable Network Virtual Terminal Protocol (TELNET) protocol\n> twamp           Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol\nShow more\n\nnat is configured as part of the service, and https controls access to the web GUI and the APIs. connsync defines how two VRAs can share connection tracking synchronization for things like stateful firewall failover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-configuring-your-services"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.3333333333,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_10":0.636439181}}

A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16471-94203-96172","score":0.662083447,"text":"\nJohn : 433-999-1000\nMartha Mob 433-999-1001\n\n\n\n* The select list The select list in an AQL select or extract statement consists of a comma-delimited list of output expressions.\n* The from list The second part of a select or an extract statement in AQL is the from list.

The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search. For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms. For example, a query for ibm expands to ibm OR international business machines OR big blue.\n\nBidirectional example:\n\n{\n\"expansions\": [\n{\n\"expanded_terms\":\n\"ibm\",\n\"international business machines\",\n\"big blue\"\n]\n}\n]\n}\n\nUnidirectional\n: The input_terms in the query is replaced by the expanded_terms. For example, a query for banana is converted to plantain OR fruit and does not contain the original term, banana. If you want an input term to be included in the query, then repeat the input term in the expanded terms list.\n\nUnidirectional example:\n\n{\n\"expansions\": [\n{\n\"input_terms\":\n\"banana\"\n],\n\"expanded_terms\":","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-search-settings"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.2,"recall_5":0.2,"recall_10":0.6,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.234639363,"ndcg_cut_5":0.1695801026,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3746125208}}

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated.

Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to \/$DATABASE\/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body.

In the following section, we see how IBM Cloudant is accessed programmatically.\n\nThe examples use Node.js, so if you want to try the code yourself, you need to install node and npm from nodejs.org.\n\nWe can then install the official IBM Cloudant Node.js library with npm install @cloudant\/cloudant. (Npm is the package manager that comes with Node.js - allowing you to access thousands of open source projects and build them into your application for free).\n\nOnce the IBM Cloudant library is installed, we can build some source code. Let's go through this code snippet line-by line:\n\nThe IBM Cloudant service URL is gleaned from the environment variable that we created earlier.\n\nThe @cloudant\/cloudant library is loaded into your Node.js app with the built-in required functions. We then create an instance of the library that is configured with the credentials we stored in the first line. We use the IBM Cloudant object to get a reference to the books database and store it in a variable database. We haven't made any API calls - only created data structures that store credentials and which database that we are working on. The main function calls db.list, which maps 1-1 with the _all_docs endpoint we saw earlier. The parameters passed to db.list must be familiar as the options that _all_docs expects to limit the result set and to return document bodies for each ID.\n\nSee another code snippet that writes a document.\n\nYou can see from the first line that standard JavaScript objects can be used in your code and sent to IBM Cloudant with no conversion, as they turn into JSON natively in JavaScript.\n\nWriting a document is simply a matter of calling db.insert, which maps to a PUT\/POST API call or to _bulk_docs.\n\nTo summarize, the official libraries for IBM Cloudant are Java\u2122, Python, and Nodejs. They are thin wrappers around the IBM Cloudant HTTP API - so it's worth understanding the underlying API to understand all the parameters.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00472-15523-16659","score":0.7499142289,"text":"\nquery: ':',\nincludeDocs: true,\nlimit: 1\n}).then(response => {\nconsole.log(response.result);\n});\n\nfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1\n\nservice = CloudantV1.new_instance()\n\nresponse = service.post_search(\ndb='<db-name>',\npartition_key='<partition-key>',\nddoc='<ddoc>',\nindex='<index-name>',\nquery=':',\ninclude_docs=True,\nlimit=1\n).get_result()\n\nprint(response)\n\npostPartitionSearchOptions := service.NewPostPartitionSearchOptions(\n\"<db-name>\",\n\"<partition-key>\",\n\"<ddoc>\",\n\"<index-name>\",\n\":\",\n)\npostPartitionSearchOptions.SetIncludeDocs(true)\npostPartitionSearchOptions.SetLimit(1)\n\nsearchResult, _, err := service.PostPartitionSearch(postPartitionSearchOptions)\nif err != nil {\npanic(err)\n}\n\nb, _ := json.MarshalIndent(searchResult, \"\", \" \")\nfmt.Println(string(b))\n\nThe previous Go example requires the following import block:\n\nimport (\n\"encoding\/json\"\n\"fmt\"\n\"github.com\/IBM\/cloudant-go-sdk\/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to query a global index:\n\nGET \/$DATABASE\/_design\/$DDOC\/_search\/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1 HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Type: application\/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00512-28883-30259","score":0.7471493483,"text":"\n\"github.com\/IBM\/cloudant-go-sdk\/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nAll Go examples require the service object to be initialized.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match.

For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

You can also view the scores by comparing specific documents (for example, compare the relation annotations that John made in one document to the relation annotations that Mary made in the same document).\n\nTo help you identify areas that require investigation, scores that fall below the value that you specified for the inter-annotator agreement threshold are highlighted in red. In early stages of your annotation project, you might find that relation scores are often worse than mention scores because a perfect relation annotation requires that the mentions that define the relationship be in agreement first.\n\nThe score in the All column is a Fleiss Kappa score. It represents how consistently the same annotation was applied by multiple human annotators across all overlapping documents in the task.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-build-groundtruth"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16425-14122-16407","score":0.7475231886,"text":"\nAnother indicator of annotation inconsistency is if you have enough annotations, but the corpus density is low.

By looking at the scores between pairs of human annotators, you can identify whether a particular annotator consistently shows lower scores than others. This annotator might be having problems understanding the guidelines or using the annotation tools, and thus is a candidate for additional training.\n\n\n\n\n\n Reviewing inter-annotator agreement scores \n\nWhen determining which documents are to be promoted to ground truth, you must review the inter-annotator agreement scores. Documents with low scores are candidates to be rejected and returned to the human annotator for improvement.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nWhen you examine inter-annotator agreement, you examine documents that were annotated by more than one human annotator. If a document is not shared across multiple annotation sets and human annotators, there is no inter-annotator agreement to calculate. When you add annotation sets to a task, ensure that the sets that you want to compare contain the same overlapping documents. You can see which documents are in an annotation set by opening the Assets> Documents page, clicking the Annotation Sets tab, and then clicking the names of the sets.\n\nYou might experience situations in which no overlapping documents are found. This might happen, for example, if you create annotation sets in two rounds and add them to the same task. Even though the annotation sets were created at about the same time, they don't have any documents in common.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-build-groundtruth"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Note that once a key is no longer restorable and has been purged, its associated data can no longer be accessed. As a result, [destroying resources](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-compliancedata-deletion) is not recommended for production environments unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe following table lists the time frames in which you can view, restore, and purge a key after it has been deleted.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https:\/\/www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path. It can also simplify the number of purge calls made.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only) \n\nPurging by hostname is similar to purging by prefixes. Use a list of hostnames to purge the cache of any assets associated with those hostnames.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by tags (Enterprise only)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment-for-best-performance"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09087-53684-55836","score":0.6834617257,"text":"\nThe access is permanently forbidden and tied to the application logic, such as insufficient rights to a resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n Context \n\nThis error message occurs when an instance policy prevents access to a resource.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

As such, network protection is not available for use as a DDoS mitigation protection service, and its enablement cannot be requested for personal use. For DDoS protection for your internet-facing workloads, consider [IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog\/services\/internet-services).\n\nFor more information about personal services available to you to further protect your infrastructure, contact your IBM Sales representative to discuss your options.\n\n\n\n About network protection \n\nIBM protects the data centers that support your cloud infrastructure from malicious attacks. However, the potential remains for a volumetric DDOS attack on any of your public IP addresses. The following mitigation processes are in place to help protect cloud infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n Null route protection \n\nNull route protection is triggered when traffic that is routed to your public IP goes beyond a certain threshold. A static null route is applied to your public IP that effectively stops all traffic from the internet to that IP address at the edge of the IBM network. This static null route remains in place for 24 hours, after which traffic to your IP is reassessed. If traffic continues to exceed the threshold, your IP remains in a null route for another 24 hours. If the traffic is below the threshold, the static null route is then removed, allowing normal traffic flow to your IP again.\n\nDuring periods of null route protection, a ticket is generated with the subject \u201cDDOS: Automated System Alert \u2013 Null Route\u201d. See the ticket for more details about why your traffic is being diverted.\n\nNull route protection only applies to public IP addresses. If you suspect that your public IP address is blocked or restricted, access your customer portal and review the tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Filtered protection \n\nUnlike null routing, filtered protection does not block or restrict your IP address from being reachable by the public internet. Protection devices analyze the traffic and use internal logic to determine if there is malicious traffic to filter. When triggered, filtered protection eliminates any suspicious traffic and allows legitimate traffic to flow to your host.\n\nThis protection remains in place until the traffic drops to appropriate levels within the threshold.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/subnets?topic=subnets-understanding-network-protect"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07882-1678-3175","score":0.669184804,"text":"\n* Check whether Hyper Protect DBaaS for PostgreSQL is enabled with customer-managed encryption and Keep Your Own Key (KYOK)\n* Check whether Cloud Object Storage is enabled with customer-managed encryption and Keep Your Own Key (KYOK)\n* Check whether Virtual Servers for VPC data volumes are enabled with customer-managed encryption and Keep Your Own Key (KYOK)\n* Check whether data disks are encrypted with customer-managed keys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NIST supplemental guidance \n\nThis control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection\/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and\/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-sc-28"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09088-7841-9875","score":0.6681648493,"text":"\nFor example, when you create, import, delete, or read a key in Key Protect, an Activity Tracker event is generated.

Registrations are associations between keys and cloud resources that help you get a full view of which encryption keys protect what data on IBM Cloud.\n\nYou can [browse the registrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources) that are available for your keys and cloud resources by using the Key Protect APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I delete a key? \n\nIn the event that a key is no longer needed or should be removed, Key Protect allows you to delete and ultimately purge keys, an action that shreds the key material and makes any of the data encrypted with it inaccessible.\n\nDeleting a key moves it into a Destroyed state, a \"soft\" deletion in which the key can still be seen and restored for 30 days. After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame. After 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08203-1588-3642","score":0.6665072441,"text":"\nThe data that you store in Hyper Protect Virtual Servers is encrypted securely at rest by using a randomly generated key, which the underlying [IBM Secure Service Container technology](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/us-en\/marketplace\/secure-service-container) manages.

Make sure you open only the ports on your virtual server that you want to be exposed to the public network.\n* Use the internal IP address to connect from one virtual server to another in the same region via the internal network. Your traffic on the internal network is automatically isolated from other tenants.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-mng-data"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13603-1840-3393","score":0.6604068875,"text":"\nIf you suspect that your public IP address is blocked or restricted, access your customer portal and review the tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Filtered protection \n\nUnlike null routing, filtered protection does not block or restrict your IP address from being reachable by the public internet. Protection devices analyze the traffic and use internal logic to determine if there is malicious traffic to filter. When triggered, filtered protection eliminates any suspicious traffic and allows legitimate traffic to flow to your host.\n\nThis protection remains in place until the traffic drops to appropriate levels within the threshold.\n\nDuring periods of filtered protection, a ticket is generated with the subject \u201cNETWORK ALERT: Automated Managed Network Alert\u201d.

This means you have full control and authority over encryption keys. No one except you (not even IBM) has access to your encryption keys. You should ensure that all Financial Services Validates services which support integration with Hyper Protect Crypto Services are properly configured.\n\nData in transit should always be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. This includes all traffic in your deployment such as between virtual server instances and between pods in Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\nUse Hyper Protect Crypto Services for TLS offload for all data that is that is requested from outside of IBM Cloud (inbound traffic to IBM Cloud) and protected by a certificate which is signed by a public Certificate Authority.

This tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again. This challenge is based on the visitor's IP, and therefore does not apply to challenges presented by WAF rules because they are based on an action that the user performs on your site.\n* Security level - Sets the security level of your website to determine which visitors receive a challenge page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04334-85221-86244","score":0.7261004448,"text":"\nIf not set, the context instance specified by ibmcloud cis instance-set INSTANCE is used.<-- <\/section \"id=\"section-delete-a-firewall-rule-options\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-delete-a-firewall-rule-examples\" \"> --> Examples Delete firewall-rule 372e67954025e0ba6aaa6d586b9e0b60. ibmcloud cis firewall-rule-delete 31984fea73a15b45779fa0df4ef62f9b 372e67954025e0ba6aaa6d586b9e0b60 -i \"cis-demo\"\n<-- <\/section \"id=\"section-delete-a-firewall-rule-examples\" \"> --><-- <\/section \"id=\"section-delete-a-Firewall-rule\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-validate-a-firewall-rule-expression\" \"> --> ibmcloud cis firewall-rule-validate Validate a firewall-rule expression. ibmcloud cis firewall-rule-validate DNS_DOMAIN_ID EXPRESSION -i, --instance INSTANCE] ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\n<-- <section \"id=\"section-validate-a-firewall-rule-expression-options\" \"> --> Command options DNS_DOMAIN_ID: The ID of DNS domain.

The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

While you develop your skill, you use the Try it out pane to verify that your assistant recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and to make corrections as needed.\n\nFrom the User conversations page, you can analyze actual interactions between the assistant you used to deploy the skill and your users. Based on those interactions, you can make corrections to improve the accuracy with which intents and entities are recognized by your dialog skill. It is difficult to know exactly how your users will ask questions, or what random messages they might submit, so it is important to frequently analyze real conversations to improve your dialog skills.\n\nFor a Watson Assistant instance that includes multiple assistants, there might be times when it is useful to use message data from the dialog skill of one assistant to improve the dialog skill used by another assistant within that same instance.\n\nAs an example, say you have a Watson Assistant instance named HelpDesk. You might have both a Production assistant and a Development assistant in your HelpDesk instance. When working in the dialog skill for the Development assistant, you can use logs from the Production assistant messages to improve the Development assistant's dialog skill.\n\nAny edits you then make within the dialog skill for the Development assistant will only affect the Development assistant's dialog skill, even though you\u2019re using data from messages sent to the Production assistant.\n\nSimilarly, if you create multiple versions of a skill, you might want to use message data from one version to improve the training data of another version.\n\nYou cannot access log data from assistants that were created in other service instances.\n\n\n\n Picking a data source \n\nThe term data source refers to the logs compiled from conversations between customers and the assistant or custom application by which a dialog skill was deployed.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-logs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

The Data Security Broker Manager is the cloud-based management console providing scalability, fault tolerance, and manageability of the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n Encryption Technology Configuration Overview: \n\nData Security Broker supports data protection services that can be configured in four main modes.\n\n\n\n Data Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker functions as an application-level encryption (ALE) software in this mode for encrypting data on a field-level basis. This is performed using Data Security Broker Manager to enumerate the data schema and enable an encryption key mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Tokenization: \n\nData Security Broker supports length preserving and data type preserving tokenization method to anonymize data at the field level databases or in semi-structured data files.\n\n\n\n\n\n Record Level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker can be configured for record level encryption to support multiple keys within a single column that are mapped to respective data owners or entities. This encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Masking: \n\nData Security Broker can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration to external parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deployment Plans in IBM Cloud Data Data Security Broker: \n\nWhen you assign and customize default Data Protection Policies with Data Security Broker Manager, there are three options that you can choose to implement your data encryption policy:\n\n\n\n Save Policy: \n\nSave Policy option is selected by default. This option saves your selected data, but does not execute encryption or data protection on your database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new policy is saved to overwrite it.

This topic describes the process of envelope encryption and how to use Key Protect to encrypt and decrypt your data.\n\nWhen working with sensitive data, it is important to use advanced encryption techniques to prevent a data breach. If you have large amounts of confidential data, it is often helpful to use a Key Management System to assist in keeping your data secure. Key Protect uses the envelope encryption technique to keep your data resilient. Envelope encryption is the process of using encrypted keys, Data Encryption Keys and Root Keys, to protect your sensitive data.\n\nImagine that you plan to send a letter to a colleague. You want to discuss information that is highly sensitive, so you generate a secret code (Data Encryption Key) that is used to write (encrypt) the message in the letter. The letter is delivered to a mailbox (wrapped Data Encryption Key) that can only be opened by those with a copy of the mailbox key (Root key), including the colleague. Anyone who does not have an exact copy of the key will be unable to open the mailbox and see it's contents. When your colleague uses the key to unlock (unencrypt) the mailbox, they will need to know the secret code that the letter is written in to be able to understand the message. Everyone who is not aware of the secret code will conclude that the letter is a random mix of characters and will not be able to understand the letter's contents.\n\nData encryption keys (DEKs) are designed to encrypt your data and can be generated and managed by your service or an IBM Cloud service.\n\nEnvelope encryption offers several benefits for protecting your data:\n\n\n\n* Protection under a combination of multiple algorithms Envelope encryption uses the best benefits from symmetric and public key algorithms to keep your keys secure.\n\n\n\n1.

For other forms of protection, IBM Cloudant provides you with supported tools that help you to create your own high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.\n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Service has Business Continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of the Cloud Service within hours if a disaster occurs. You are responsible for your data backup, and associated recovery of your content.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the automatic capabilities and supported tools that are offered by IBM Cloudant.\n\n\n\n Types and levels of protection \n\nThe type of protection you might want depends on the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nFor example, you might want to have a high level of data availability so that you can still access your data, even if a limited amount of hardware within the system failed. This requirement is necessary for \"High Availability\" (HA). It means that you provide the best possible continuous data availability after a hardware failure. Different HA techniques tolerate different levels of failure before operations are affected.\n\nYou might want to have quick and easy ways of backing up and restoring data. For example, after a severe or extensive hardware failure, you want the ability to make all the data available on an alternative system as quickly as possible. This requirement is necessary for \"Disaster Recovery\" (DR). A disaster generally means that a database is no longer available in one or more locations. For example, a power outage might cause all systems in a database cluster to fail. Or a large-scale network failure might mean systems in a cluster can't be contacted, even though they continue to work correctly.\n\nAddressing your HA or DR requirements often begins by simplifying the problem into more generic requirements. When you identify your requirements, you can apply the tools and features that help solve the generic needs. Together, the tools and features can address your HA or DR requirements.\n\nDifferent tools and features provide different levels of protection. The different features might be more or less suitable for your specific HA or DR requirement.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00523-8515-10661","score":0.7158269286,"text":"\n[In-region automatic data redundancy](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backupin-region-automatic-data-redundancy) provides applications with high availability access to data.

Recently, you might have heard about Heroku changing their policy on free - the free tier. It's causing a challenge for a lot of developers out there so I want to take a handful of moments here to show you how you can migrate from Heroku to Code Engine from IBM Cloud in just a handful of steps. So let's go ahead and start playing around with it and see how quickly you can actually make your system work.\n\nSo first thing first, if you haven't seen it this is the actual line inside the official blog from Heroku, starting on November 28, 2022, we plan to stop free - offering the free product plans and plan on shutting down the free dynos and data services. We'll be sending out a series of email communications to affected users. This is challenging for a lot of beginner beginner web applications. I know for a fact personally I used Heroku when I first started back in the day so this is a pretty large hit for a lot of people and I want to show you how easy it is to convert from Heroku to Code Engine.\n\nSo first thing first, let's actually see a nice little application I've created. If I go ahead and bring up my application here, we have a nice little flask app. If you don't know what python is or flask is, it's a it's a format for python to be able to run an application on a standard port. So let's say we have this application; it says \u201cHello World!\u201d. I've already deployed it and we can check out right here We have our amazing production app at heroku.com. It says \u201chello world\u201d and we want to go ahead and change it. We wanted to update it so I'm going to go ahead and quickly update it to \u201cHello Moving from Heroku to Code Engine\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and come out of it. git add .git commit -m \u201cupdate hello line\u201d.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1121369-1123401","score":0.6267848015,"text":"\nSee [Locations for resource deployment](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-locations) for more information.\n* Are the two free months of transition period resources in addition to my existing server time?\n\nYes.

You can restore volumes during instance creation or when you want to create stand-alone boot or data volumes to be used later. You can restore a data volume to add more storage to an existing instance. You can use backup snapshots to restore volumes in a different region for business continuity purposes or geographic expansion. You can restore volumes from backup snapshots in the UI, from the CLI, with the API, or Terraform.\n\n\n\n About restoring a volume from a backup snapshot \n\nWhen you restore a volume from a backup, the service creates another volume. The restored volume inherits the same [profile](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), capacity, data, and metadata as the original volume. However, you can choose a different profile and capacity if you prefer. If the source volume used [customer-managed encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-customer-managed-encryption), the new volume inherits that encryption.\n\nRestoring a volume from a backup snapshot creates a boot or data volume, depending on whether the snapshot is bootable or nonbootable. The volume appears first as pending while it's being created. During the restoration, your data is copied from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC. After the volume is hydrated (fully provisioned), you can use the new boot or data volume. For more information about how performance is affected during restoration, see [Performance impact when backup snapshots are used](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore&interface=uibaas-performance-considerations).\n\nFor best performance, use backups with fast restore.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06519-1473-3456","score":0.663457036,"text":"\nWhile storage and memory are restored to the same as the source deployment, specific instance configurations are not automatically set for the new instance.

You must wait until the new deployment is provisioned and the backup is restored before deleting the old deployment. Deleting a deployment also deletes its backups.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03196-53970-56256","score":0.680003047,"text":"\n* Jump to another dialog node: Use this option when you want the conversation to go directly to an entirely different dialog node. You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03334-4-1943","score":0.6788006425,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\nTo learn more about creating intents, watch the following 2 1\/2-minute video.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03282-4605-6541","score":0.6787133217,"text":"\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks.

See the [Compound questions](https:\/\/sodoherty.ai\/2017\/02\/06\/compound-questions\/) entry from Simon O'Doherty's blog for strategies you can try. (Simon is a developer on the Watson Assistant team.)\n* Dealing with ambiguous intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish that is ambiguous enough that your assistant finds two or more nodes with intents that could potentially address it. How does the dialog know which dialog branch to follow? If you enable disambiguation, it can show users their options and ask the user to pick the correct one. See [Disambiguation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity. But, using @appliance:(air conditioner) gets expanded to entity['appliance'].contains('air conditioner'), which matches whenever there is at least one @appliance entity of value 'air conditioner' detected in the user input.\n* Hiding data from the log: You can prevent information from being stored in Watson logs by storing it in a context variable and nesting the context variable within the $private section of the message context. For example: $private.my_info. Storing data in the private object hides it from the logs only. The information is still stored in the underlying JSON object.

A branch is composed of multiple nodes.\n\n\n\n Dialog nodes \n\nEach dialog node contains, at a minimum, a condition and a response.\n\n![Shows user input going to a box that contains the statement If: CONDITION, Then: RESPONSE](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/node1-empty.png)\n\n\n\n* Condition: Specifies the information that must be present in the user input for this node in the dialog to be triggered. The information is typically a specific intent. It might also be an entity type, an entity value, or a context variable value. See [Conditions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-builddialog-overview-conditions) for more information.\n* Response: The utterance that your assistant uses to respond to the user.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03071-7-2056","score":0.6978412867,"text":"\nTutorial: Adding a node with slots to a dialog \n\nIn this tutorial, you will add slots to a dialog node to collect multiple pieces of information from a user within a single node.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\nTo learn more about creating intents, watch the following 2 1\/2-minute video.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03373-4327-6061","score":0.6957265735,"text":"\n* [Dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities.

A dialog feature takes precedence over actions. You can use actions to supplement a dialog-based conversation, but the dialog drives the conversation with users to match their requests.\n\nA dialog node calls an action to perform a task and then return to the dialog. From a single dialog node, you can make a call to either a webhook or an action, not both.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02953-12940-14393","score":0.6996219754,"text":"\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\nYou can see the number of dialog nodes in a dialog skill from the assistant tile.

The trained data section lists the number of dialog nodes.\n\nIf the total seems larger than you expected, it might be because the dialog that you build from the application is translated into a JSON object. Some fields that appear to be part of a single node are actually structured as separate dialog nodes in the underlying JSON object.\n\n\n\n* Each node and folder is represented as its own node.\n* Each conditional response that is associated with a single dialog node is represented as an individual node.\n* For a node with slots, each slot, slot found response, slot not found response, slot handler, and if set, the prompt for everything response is an individual node.

You can add the nodes to a folder with a false condition to prevent them from being processed.\n\n\n\nThese characteristics of the folder impact how the nodes in a folder are processed:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If no condition is specified, then your assistant processes the nodes within the folder directly. If a condition is specified, your assistant first evaluates the folder condition to determine whether to process the nodes within it.\n* Customizations: Any configuration settings that you apply to the folder are inherited by the nodes in the folder. If you change the digression settings of the folder, for example, the changes are inherited by all the nodes in the folder.\n* Tree hierarchy: Nodes in a folder are treated as root or child nodes based on whether the folder is added to the dialog tree at the root or child level. Any root level nodes that you add to a root level folder continue to function as root nodes; they do not become child nodes of the folder, for example. However, if you move a root level node into a folder that is a child of another node, then the root node becomes a child of that other node.\n\n\n\nFolders have no impact on the order in which nodes are evaluated. Nodes continue to be processed from first to last. As your assistant travels down the tree, when it encounters a folder, if the folder has no condition or its condition is true, it immediately processes the first node in the folder, and continues down the tree in order from there.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models.

While you develop your skill, you use the Try it out pane to verify that your assistant recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and to make corrections as needed.\n\nFrom the User conversations page, you can analyze actual interactions between the assistant you used to deploy the skill and your users. Based on those interactions, you can make corrections to improve the accuracy with which intents and entities are recognized by your dialog skill. It is difficult to know exactly how your users will ask questions, or what random messages they might submit, so it is important to frequently analyze real conversations to improve your dialog skills.\n\nFor a Watson Assistant instance that includes multiple assistants, there might be times when it is useful to use message data from the dialog skill of one assistant to improve the dialog skill used by another assistant within that same instance.\n\nAs an example, say you have a Watson Assistant instance named HelpDesk. You might have both a Production assistant and a Development assistant in your HelpDesk instance. When working in the dialog skill for the Development assistant, you can use logs from the Production assistant messages to improve the Development assistant's dialog skill.\n\nAny edits you then make within the dialog skill for the Development assistant will only affect the Development assistant's dialog skill, even though you\u2019re using data from messages sent to the Production assistant.\n\nSimilarly, if you create multiple versions of a skill, you might want to use message data from one version to improve the training data of another version.\n\nYou cannot access log data from assistants that were created in other service instances.\n\n\n\n Picking a data source \n\nThe term data source refers to the logs compiled from conversations between customers and the assistant or custom application by which a dialog skill was deployed.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-logs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.2640681226,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2640681226}}

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03054-19820-21851","score":0.7829084396,"text":"\nClick Add existing skill.\n\nClick the skill that you want to add from the available skills that are displayed.\n\n\n\nAfter you add a search skill to an assistant, it is automatically enabled for the assistant as follows:\n\n\n\n* If the assistant has only a search skill, any user input that is submitted to one of the assistant's integration channels triggers the search skill.\n* If the assistant has both a dialog skill and a search skill, any user input triggers the dialog skill first.

These features are available for both the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.\n\nThe features involve the use of elements of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). The descriptions of the features provide information about how they interact with related SSML elements and attributes.\n\n\n\n Using speaking styles \n\nThe expressive neural voices determine the sentiment of the text from the context of its words and phrases. The speech that they produce, in addition to having a very conversational style, reflects the mood of the text. The expressive voices naturally express gratitude, thankfulness, happiness, empathy, confusion, and other sentiments by default, with no explicit additional tagging.\n\nHowever, you can embellish the voices' natural tendencies by using the <express-as> element with the required style attribute to indicate that all or some of the text is to emphasize specific characteristics. These characteristics are referred to as speaking styles:\n\n\n\n* cheerful - Expresses happiness and good news. The style is upbeat, welcoming, and conveys a positive message.\n* empathetic - Expresses empathy and compassion. The style has sympathetic undertones, but it is not excessively sorrowful.\n* neutral - Expresses objectivity and evenness. The style strives for less emotion, and instead conveys a more even and instructional tone.\n* uncertain - Expresses uncertainty and confusion. The style conveys the feeling of being unsure or in doubt.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the effect of the styles is very subtle. In such cases, the differences might not be readily discernible from the default expressive tone. But there are instances where the style can audibly enhance the voices' inherent ability to detect and express emotion. The differences are often detectable only on certain words and phrases.\n\nTable 1 provides examples of each available style for the <express-as> element. To demonstrate the effect of the styles, the table provides two samples for each example. The first sample speaks the text with the default en-US_EmmaExpressive voice.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-synthesis-expressive"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07222-1023-1564","score":0.6328107715,"text":"\n* [Building with Watson: Passage Retrieval and Relevancy Training with Watson Discovery](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8BiuQKPQZJk&list=PLZDyxLlNKRY_GJskIreh9sQgExJ4z8oZO&index=9&t=0s)\n* [Building with Watson: Network Visualizations with Watson Discovery Service](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pcNwV9prfmY&list=PLZDyxLlNKRY_GJskIreh9sQgExJ4z8oZO&index=10&t=0s)\n* [Building with Watson: A technical intro to the Watson Discovery Service](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FikHwoJ6_FE&list=PLZDyxLlNKRY_GJskIreh9sQgExJ4z8oZO&index=11&t=417s)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-resources"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09906-7-1885","score":0.6307252645,"text":"\nGetting started with Natural Language Understanding \n\nThis short tutorial introduces the Natural Language Understanding API with example requests and links to additional resources.\n\nWatch the following video for a visual summary of getting started with the Natural Language Understanding service.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\n\n\n* Create an instance of the service:\n\n\n\n1.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02961-7-1871","score":0.716570437,"text":"\nDialog building tips \n\nGet tips about ways to address common tasks.\n\n\n\n Adding nodes \n\n\n\n* Add a node name that describes the purpose of the node.\n\nYou currently know what the node does, but months from now you might not.

If a child node in any dialog branch conditions on a request or question that you do not want the assistant to handle, add a Connect to human agent response type to the child node.\n\nAt run time, if the conversation reaches this child node, the dialog is passed to a human agent at that point.\n\n\n\nYour dialog is now ready to support transfers from your assistant to a service desk agent.\n\nFor more information about different service desk solutions, see the following resources:\n\n\n\n* [Adding service desk support to the web chat](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-haa)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03196-4614-6320","score":0.7071838975,"text":"\n* Wait for user input: Your assistant pauses until new input is provided by the user.\n* Skip user input: Your assistant jumps directly to the first child node.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated before the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-169150-171163","score":0.7018169165,"text":"\n* When you create a dialog, two nodes are now added to it for you: 1) a Welcome node at the start the dialog tree that contains the greeting to display to the user and 2) an Anything else node at the end of the tree that catches any user inquiries that are not recognized by other nodes in the dialog and responds to them.

These templates help to quickly install software, such as IBM Cloud Paks, IBM\u00ae WebSphere Application Server for IBM Cloud\u00ae, or Kibana and Grafana into the target service of your choice.\n2.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-how-it-works"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12095-7-2147","score":0.7658289075,"text":"\nGeneral \n\nAnswers to common questions about the IBM Cloud Schematics are classified into following section.\n\n\n\n What is IBM Cloud Schematics and how does it work? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics provides powerful tools to automate your cloud infrastructure provisioning and management process, the configuration and operation of your cloud resources, and the deployment of your app workloads.\n\nTo do so, Schematics uses open source projects, such as Terraform, Ansible, Red Hat OpenShift, Operators, and Helm, and delivers these capabilities to you as a managed service. Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template. Review available service plans and pricing information for each resource that you are about to create. Some services come with a limit per IBM Cloud account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12297-145307-146781","score":0.7628344893,"text":"\n* [What am I charged for when I use Schematics?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqcharges)\n* [Does IBM Cloud Schematics support multiple Terraform provider versions?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqprovider-versions)\n* [How do I generate IAM access token, if client ID bx is used?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqcreateworkspace-generate-tokens)\n* [How do I rectify 'Failed to clone Git repository, might not find remote ref refs\/heads\/master (most likely invalid branch name is passed)'?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqtemplate-errors)\n* [Can I increase the timeout for null-exec and remote-exec resource?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqtimeout-null-resource)\n* [How can I save user-defined files that are generated by the Terraform modules and use them across multiple Terraform plan, apply, destroy, refresh, or import commands?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqpersist-file)\n* [How do I identify the best way to synchronize a deleted resource with the Terraform state?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqsync-delresource-terraform)\n* [How do I overcome the request exceeds the Cluster resource quota of '100' for the account in any region?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faqclusterquota-warn-faq)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12098-7-1814","score":0.7612082362,"text":"\nSoftware deployment in IBM Cloud Schematics \n\nTry out one of the IBM\u00ae provided software templates to quickly spin up a classic Virtual Server Instance (VSI), and automatically configure the instance to connect to an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for PostgreSQL instance.\n\nWith IBM Cloud Schematics, you can choose from a wide variety of [software and infrastructure templates](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalogsoftware) that you can use to set up IBM Cloud services, and to install IBM and Third party software.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test? That works on every other database that you ever used, correct?\n\nNot on IBM Cloudant.\n\nOr rather, it works 99 times out of 100.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-in-practice"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-451250-453592","score":0.6694560051,"text":"\nAs always, successful modeling involves achieving a balance between ease of use versus the performance characteristics you're hoping to achieve.\n\n(The FAQ for modeling data to scale is based on a blog article by Mike Rhodes, My top five tips for modeling your data to scale.)\n\n\n\nIf you're changing the same piece of state at a rate of once per second or more, consider making your documents immutable. This practice significantly reduces the chance that you create conflicted documents.\n\nConversely, if you're updating a specific document less than once every 10 seconds, an update-in-place data model - that is, updating existing documents - simplifies your application code considerably.\n\nTypically, data models based on immutable data require the use of views to summarize the documents that include the current state.

The retention period can't be shorter than the backup frequency or it returns an error.\n\nYou can also specify the number of backups to retain, up to 750 per volume, after which the oldest backups are deleted.\n* Are there limitations on how many backups I can take?\n\nYes. You can create 10 backup policies per account and up to 750 backups of a volume. For other limitations of this release, see [Limitations in this release](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about&interface=uibackup-service-limitations).\n* How do I create a new volume from a backup?\n\nRestoring from a backup snapshot creates a volume with data from the snapshot. You can restore data from a backup by using the UI, the CLI, or the API. You can restore boot and data volumes during instance creation, when you modify an existing instance, or when you provision a stand-alone volume. When you restore data from a backup snapshot, the data is pulled from an Object Storage bucket. For best performance, you can enable backup snapshots for fast restore. By using the fast restore feature, you can restore a volume that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. When you use fast restore, the data is pulled from a cached backup snapshot in another zone of your VPC. For more information, see [About restoring from a backup snapshot](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore).\n* Am I charged for usage?\n\nYes. Cost for backups is calculated based on GB capacity that is stored per month, unless the duration is less than one month. The backup exists on the account until it reaches its retention period, or when you delete it manually, or when you reach the end of a billing cycle, whichever comes first.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.6730123162,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07222-1023-1564","score":0.6418535113,"text":"\n* [Building with Watson: Passage Retrieval and Relevancy Training with Watson Discovery](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8BiuQKPQZJk&list=PLZDyxLlNKRY_GJskIreh9sQgExJ4z8oZO&index=9&t=0s)\n* [Building with Watson: Network Visualizations with Watson Discovery Service](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pcNwV9prfmY&list=PLZDyxLlNKRY_GJskIreh9sQgExJ4z8oZO&index=10&t=0s)\n* [Building with Watson: A technical intro to the Watson Discovery Service](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FikHwoJ6_FE&list=PLZDyxLlNKRY_GJskIreh9sQgExJ4z8oZO&index=11&t=417s)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-resources"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03110-6742-7759","score":0.6335508227,"text":"\nBut given the nature of machine learning models and the nuance and subtlety of natural languages processing, you may find some discrepancies from version to version.

tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Because base models for different languages are independent of each other, as are different models for the same language, updates to individual base models do not affect other models.\n\nWhen a base model is updated, you might need to upgrade any custom models that are built on that base model to take advantage of the improvements. An update to a base model that requires an upgrade produces a new version of the base model (for example, en-US_BroadbandModel.v2020-01-16). An update that does not require an upgrade does not produce a new version.\n\n\n\n* For previous-generation models, all updates to a base model produce a new version of the model.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16437-7-2129","score":0.6696115136,"text":"\nMaking machine learning model improvements \n\nAfter you determine areas in which the model is having trouble, take steps to improve its performance.\n\n\n\n Creating model versions \n\nAfter you create a machine learning model, you can take a snapshot to keep a backup version of the current resources in case you want to restore the resources in a future iteration.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nThe F1 score provides an indication of the quality of the model.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.674169898,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12376-1665-3857","score":0.6453684568,"text":"\nsecrets-manager.secret-policies.get Get secret policies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Events for secret groups \n\nThe following table lists the secret group actions that generate an event.\n\n\n\nTable 2.

If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00326-11562-12379","score":0.6442803741,"text":"\nFocus sentinel Cookie Preferences\n\nYour privacy choices\n\nYour privacy choices\n\n![0_ti_146001191_Ver_2_mid_d0177bb7-8fda-44f5-ae1c-56f27cbf70b5_sid_cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542_vid_cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d_vids_0_msclkid_N_pi_918639831_lg_en-US_sw_3840_sh_2160_sc_30_nwd_1_tl_About_20HTTPS_20_7C_20IBM_20Cloud_20Docs_p_https_3A_2F_2Fcloud.ibm.com_2Fdocs_2FCDN_3Ftopic_3DCDN-about-https_r_lt_617_evt_pageLoad_sv_1_rn_393879](https:\/\/bat.bing.com\/action\/0?ti=146001191&Ver=2&mid=d0177bb7-8fda-44f5-ae1c-56f27cbf70b5&sid=cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542&vid=cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d&vids=0&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=3840&sh=2160&sc=30&nwd=1&tl=About%20HTTPS%20%7C%20IBM%20Cloud%20Docs&p=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.ibm.com%2Fdocs%2FCDN%3Ftopic%3DCDN-about-https&r=&lt=617&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&rn=393879)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/CDN?topic=CDN-about-https"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.6384213567,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04168-14561-15394","score":0.6330462694,"text":"\nSubmit\n\nFocus sentinel Cookie Preferences\n\nYour privacy choices\n\nYour privacy choices\n\n![0_ti_146001191_Ver_2_mid_8f003ed6-6c50-456e-9052-528396c5d89e_sid_cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542_vid_cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d_vids_0_msclkid_N_pi_918639831_lg_en-US_sw_3840_sh_2160_sc_30_nwd_1_tl_HTTP_20concepts_20_7C_20IBM_20Cloud_20Docs_p_https_3A_2F_2Fcloud.ibm.com_2Fdocs_2Fcis_3Ftopic_3Dcis-http-concepts_r_lt_974_evt_pageLoad_sv_1_rn_666567](https:\/\/bat.bing.com\/action\/0?ti=146001191&Ver=2&mid=8f003ed6-6c50-456e-9052-528396c5d89e&sid=cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542&vid=cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d&vids=0&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=3840&sh=2160&sc=30&nwd=1&tl=HTTP%20concepts%20%7C%20IBM%20Cloud%20Docs&p=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.ibm.com%2Fdocs%2Fcis%3Ftopic%3Dcis-http-concepts&r=&lt=974&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&rn=666567)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-http-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13785-5763-7073","score":0.6229864955,"text":"\n* [Protecting sensitive information in your Watson service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-keyservice)\n* [Public and private network endpoints](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-public-private-endpoints)\n* [Virtual Private Endpoints](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-virtual-private-endpoints)\n\n\n\n* Service background\n\n\n\n* [The science behind the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-science)\n* [Research references](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-references)\n\n\n\n\n\n* Reference\n\n\n\n* [API & SDK reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/text-to-speech)\n* [High availability and disaster recovery](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-ha-dr)\n* [Activity Tracker events](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-at-events)\n* [Watson SDKs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-using-sdks)\n* [Watson GitHub repos](https:\/\/github.com\/watson-developer-cloud\/)\n\n\n\n* Help\n\n\n\n* [Known limitations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-known-limitations)\n* [Usage FAQs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-faq-usage)\n* Developer community","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-usingHTTP"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-1672-3877","score":0.6190674901,"text":"\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret. For more information about image pull secrets, see [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/home\/).\n\n\n\n Types of image registries \n\nImages are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry).\n\nPublic registries, such as public Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker and Code Engine to create your first application or job. But when it comes to enterprise workloads, use a private registry, such as the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users. For private registries, use registry secrets to ensure that the credentials are available to gain access to the private registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

If you don't specify a resource-type and a resource, the policy grants access to all resources in the account. Alternatively, if your namespace is within a resource group, permission can be granted by using an IAM access policy on that resource group.\n\nFor example, use the following command to create a user policy. Where <user_email> is the user's email address, <region> is the region, <roles> is the role, or roles, that you want the user to have, and <namespace_name> is the name of the namespace.\n\nibmcloud iam user-policy-create <user_email> --service-name container-registry --region <region> --roles <roles> [--resource-type namespace --resource <namespace_name>]\n\nThe following table details actions that are mapped to operations on the service and to the service access roles for using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 5.

Worker nodes are organized into worker pools of the same flavor, or profile of CPU, memory, operating system, attached disks, and other properties. The worker nodes correspond to the Kubernetes Node resource, and are managed by a Kubernetes master that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster. So when you deploy the resources for a containerized app, the Kubernetes master decides which worker node to deploy those resources on, accounting for the deployment requirements and available capacity in the cluster. Kubernetes resources include services, deployments, and pods. For more information, see [Service architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n\nNamespace\n: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-roks-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03824-1382-3368","score":0.6983599663,"text":"\nEach node contains the services necessary to run pods and is managed by the master components.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple. Its simplicity also means it can be misused. That's why it's important to verify that the messages sent to your assistant are coming from authorized users only.\n\nBefore you enable security, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Create a RS256 private\/public key pair.\n\nYou can use a tool such as the OpenSSL command line or PuTTYgen.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16368-14455-16070","score":0.6346765757,"text":"\nDepending on whether you have enabled security for the web chat, you can use either the [updateUserID](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodsupdateuserid) instance method or the [updateIdentityToken](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodsupdateidentity) method to specify user identity information.\n\nFor more information about how user identity information is specified and how it is used, see [Managing user identity information](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-userid).\n\n\n\n\n\n Security and administration \n\nSecuring the web chat\n: To secure the web chat, you can use JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate users and encrypt private data.

For example, \"festnetznummer\" (landline number) concatenates the words \"festnetz\" (landline) and \"nummer\" (number). When your customers chat with your assistant, they might write a compound word as a single word, as hyphenated words, or as separate words. Previously, the variants resulted in different intent confidence scores and different entity mention counts based on your training data. With the addition of the word decomposition function, the models now treat all compound word variants as equivalent. This update means you no longer need to add examples of every variant of the compound words to your training data.\n\n\n\n\n\n 19 January 2021 \n\nThe Phone and SMS with Twilio integrations are now generally available!\n: For more information, see:\n\n\n\n* [Integrating with phone](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phone)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03218-14234-15638","score":0.6583487988,"text":"\nWhenever an incoming message suggests that a customer wants to report a stolen credit card, you don't want your assistant's response to be lost in a disambiguation list of options.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues.

The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16321-19290-20983","score":0.6852440834,"text":"\n\"uri\": \"sip:12345556789\\@myhost.com\"\n\n\n\n Transferring after hangup \n\nBy default, the phone integration transfers calls by using a SIP REFER request. Depending on the IVR service provider, you might need to configure call transfer to use a SIP BYE request instead. Use the transfer_method attribute to specify how to transfer the call, using either refer or hangup. When transfer_method is set to hangup instead of refer, the behavior of the transfer action changes. Instead of sending a SIP REFER request, the phone integration plays back any associated text and then hangs up the call by sending a SIP BYE request.\n\nAfter the hangup, the phone integration passes the transfer destination that is specified in the url attribute to the call anchor in the BYE message.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region. When the failover needs to be manually triggered, make the following changes:\n\n\n\n* The embed script that contains your integration ID, region, service instance ID, and subscription ID (if applicable) needs be changed or updated to use the IDs for the new integration and region.\n* If you are using Salesforce or ZenDesk integrations for connecting to human agents, update the configuration within those systems to make sure they can communicate with the correct integration. Follow the instructions on the Live agent tab in the web chat configuration for setting up those systems. This is only needed for obtaining the conversation history for the agent.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03312-5487-7760","score":0.6473634243,"text":"\nIf a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03423-10366-11490","score":0.6430767775,"text":"\n\"start_timestamp\": \"2021-10-12T20:54:06.321Z\",\n\"stop_timestamp\": \"2021-10-12T20:54:14.338Z\",\n\"response_milliseconds\": 535\n}\n},\n{\n\"type\": \"enable_speech_barge_in\"\n},\n{\n\"type\": \"text_to_speech\",\n\"barge_in_occurred\": true,\n\"streaming_statistics\": {\n\"transaction_id\": \"eafdd846-2829-4e1a-8068-b1035510b1e1\",\n\"start_timestamp\": \"2021-10-12T20:54:14.795Z\",\n\"stop_timestamp\": \"2021-10-12T20:54:20.388Z\",\n\"response_milliseconds\": 447\n}\n}\n]\n},\n{\n\"assistant\": {\n\"log_id\": \"07d74b35-0205-43e4-923c-1e43e1cb429c\",\n\"response_milliseconds\": 0,\n\"start_timestamp\": \"2021-10-12T20:54:20.377Z\"\n},\n\"request\": {\n\"type\": \"hangup\"\n},\n\"response\": ]\n}\n]\n}\n]\n}\n\nShow more\n\nThe payload JSON object for a call detail record event contains the following keys:\n\n\n\nKeys for the payload object\n\n Key Type Description \n\n primary_phone_number string The phone number that was called. \n global_session_id string The unique session identifier. \n failure_occurred Boolean Indicates whether a failure occurred during the call. \n failure_details string Details about a failure. \n transfer_occurred Boolean Indicates whether an attempt was made to transfer a call","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-log"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03158-7739-9484","score":0.6399466395,"text":"\n[checkmark icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/phone-checkmark-save.png) to save each number.\n* To import a set of phone numbers that are stored in a comma-separated values (CSV) file, click the Upload a CSV file icon (![Add phone number](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/phone-integ-import-number.png)), and then find the CSV file that contains the list of phone numbers.\n\nThe phone numbers you upload will replace any existing numbers in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Advanced configuration options \n\nClick the Advanced options tab to make any of the following customizations to the call behavior:\n\n\n\n Handle call and transfer failures \n\nYou can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason.

If performance results are worse, and you want to revert to a previous version before testing any further:\n\n\n\n1. Open the Assets > Dictionaries page and download any dictionaries that you want to re-use in the restored model.\n2. Click Machine Learning Model > Versions and click Promote for the version that you want to restore. The version that you promote becomes the current version, and the version number changes to 2.0. When you promote a version, the major version number is incremented and the minor version number becomes 0, for example, 1.1 becomes 2.0.\n3. Open the Dictionaries page and upload the dictionaries that you downloaded.\n4. If testing of the new version requires changes to ground truth, open the Machine Learning Model > Annotations page. Click the Annotation Tasks tab and create a new annotation task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Modifying a type system without losing human annotations \n\nYou might need to make modifications while you train a model, based on the performance statistics. But, generally, you want the type system to be as close to final as possible before you begin large-scale annotation tasks. If you change the type system after human annotators began their work, they must revisit the documents that they annotated. They must assess the applicability of the type system changes.\n\n\n\n About this task","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-improve-ml"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08851-1541-3076","score":0.6592988372,"text":"\nuse the new syntax features from Terraform on IBM Cloud v0.12, and identify\nany constructs that may need to be adjusted for correct operation with\nTerraform on IBM Cloud v0.13.\n\nWe recommend to use this command in a clean version control work tree, so that\nyou can easily see the proposed changes as a diff against the latest commit.\nIf you have uncommited changes already present, we recommend aborting this\ncommand and dealing with them before running this command again.\n\nWould you like to upgrade the module in the current directory?\nOnly 'yes' is accepted to confirm.\n\nEnter a value: yes\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpgrade complete!\n\nThe configuration files were upgraded successfully.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16636-0-1664","score":0.6775509119,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Integrating Presto with Apache Hudi using a Hudi connector \n\nYou can integrate Presto with Apache Hudi by using the Hudi connector.

Additionally, you can enforce rate limits through Plans or through operations within a Plan's APIs that override the Plan's rate limit.\n\nPlans can also specify billing costs for customers who use your Products. For example, you can define three different Plans for a single Product. Each Plan can have a different subscription cost and a different rate limit that targets different customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Products \n\nPlans and APIs are grouped in Products. Through Products, you can manage the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans. Use the API Designer to create, edit, and stage your Product. Use the API Manager to manage the lifecycle of your Product.\n\nThe following diagram demonstrates how Products, Plans, and APIs relate to one another. Note how Plans belong to only one Product, can possess different APIs to other Plans within the same Product, and can share APIs with Plans from any Product. Figure to show the hierarchy of Products, Plans, and APIs. ![Figure to show the hierarchy of Products, Plans, and APIs.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/78bb71851d95d7580503eb9ba10cf3ae31490ade\/apiconnect\/images\/plan_product_hierarchy.png)\n\nYou can create Plans only within Products, and these Products are then published in a Catalog. A lifecycle manager can then control the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans through the API Manager. Through the Developer Portal, the customer is then able to subscribe to one of the Plans that is available to them, as determined in the API Manager. If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-5228-7163","score":0.6519297957,"text":"\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.\n* Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing your payments \n\nIf you're a new Pay-As-You-Go account owner that is located in the US and you are paying with a credit card, you can replace your current card with a new one or edit the details of an existing card. In either case, you manage your credit card from the [Payments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/payments) page in the IBM Cloud console.\n\nIf you own one of the following accounts, in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, you can go to Manage > Billing and usage to make a one-time payment, change your credit card details, view your billing items, and manage your invoices.\n\n\n\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts based in the US with any payment method other than a credit card\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts not based in the US\n* New and existing Subscription accounts worldwide\n\n\n\nThe process for updating a credit card requires a manual review that might take a few days to process.

Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16252-7-1601","score":0.6470519304,"text":"\nManaging your plan \n\nThis topic provides:\n\n\n\n* A [plan information](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-managing-planadmin-managing-plan-information) reference\n* Steps on [upgrading your plan](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-managing-planadmin-managing-plan-upgrade)\n\n\n\n\n\n Plan information \n\nBilling for the use of Watson Assistant is managed through your IBM Cloud\u00ae account.\n\nThe metrics that are used for billing purposes differ based on your plan type.

If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12561-12509-13465","score":0.6602228284,"text":"\nIdentify the departments within your company that correspond with the account groups.\n\nIf the contacts that are assigned to your account groups are associated with the department that you want to recover costs from, finding the contact is one way to find this information.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.3333333333,"recall_10":0.3333333333,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_10":0.469278726}}

The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice.

If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill.

If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03704-4411-6289","score":0.69002074,"text":"\nYou might manage your payment method on a separate billing platform, [IBM Billing](https:\/\/myibm.ibm.com\/billing\/).
