These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00576-6036-7924","score":15.50372,"text":"\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/databases-for-postgresql).\n* Data warehouse for ad hoc querying.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-3166-5282","score":15.348904,"text":"\nIt is accessed with an HTTP API and can therefore be accessed by any device on the internet that speaks HTTP: application code, web browser, IoT device, or mobile phone.

The next part is called The Document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Document video \n\nLearn about IBM Cloudant databases and documents work.\n\n\n\n* The Document video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 2 - The IBM Cloudant Document.\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that IBM Cloudant is a JSON document store. Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-4796-6846","score":15.049683,"text":"\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

JSON has no native Date type, so dates are usually stored in 30-October-2018 or similar formats. We return to dates later.\n\nNow, for your first practical exercise, visit www.ibm.com\/cloud. Register an account with the IBM Cloud, if you don't have one already.\n\nOnce registered, you can click services, search for the Cloudant database, and provision a new service.\n\nThe IBM Cloudant Lite service provides a free plan to allow users to try IBM Cloudant in a limited capacity while in development. Its bigger brother, the Standard Plan, is a paid-for service where you specify the number of reads, writes, and queries per second for your application and that capacity is reserved for you. You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way. It has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database. You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-6386-8382","score":14.960859,"text":"\nIt has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database. You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant. We could decide to add the \"address\" object only to the following documents:\n\n\n\n* Documents that are created from now on.\n* Only documents that we have addresses for.\n\n\n\nIn other words, documents of the same type can have fields present or missing.\n\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00612-7-2163","score":14.924034,"text":"\nMigration overview \n\nThe [IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/cloudant) database-as-a-service offering is a JSON document store that runs on multi-tenant clusters.

Capacity metrics\n\n Metric Description \n\n Reads per second The rate when simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its _id, or querying against a partitioned database that uses a partition key. \n Writes per second The rate when data is written to the database. API calls dealing with document creation, update, or deletion count as \"writes\". \n Global Queries per second The rate when the database is queried by global indices, typically by accessing the _find endpoint, secondary MapReduce, or search indices. \n Storage The amount of disk space occupied by your JSON data, attachments, and secondary indices. \n\n\n\nAs an example, the Lite plan offers 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB of storage for free. This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance. The Standard plan's smallest capacity has 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 20 GB of storage for USD$76.65 per month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-migrating-to-ibm-cloudant-on-ibm-cloud"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-25421-27357","score":14.899009,"text":"\nType acurl $URL\/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

They are displayed as a section within each document query result and are ordered by passage relevance.\n\nDiscovery uses sentence boundary detection to pick a passage that includes a full sentence. It searches for passages that have an approximate length of 200 characters, then looks at chunks of content that are twice that length to find passages that contain full sentences. Sentence boundary detection works for all supported languages and uses language-specific logic.\n\nFor all project types except Conversational Search, you can change how the passages are displayed in the search results from the Customize display > Search results page. For example, you can configure the number of passages that are shown per document and the maximum character size per passage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-index-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07046-4911-6551","score":19.21075,"text":"\nDates from metadata date fields, such as extracted_metadata.publicationdate, are stored in the index as dates as long as the date format matches one of the supported date data type formats.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00556-7-1696","score":18.977404,"text":"\nHow to use attachments \n\nAnother way to store data is to use attachments.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly. Deleting an IBM Cloudant document leaves a tombstone document behind, so don't rely on deleting documents to recover disk space. Instead, you must rely on deleting whole databases.\n\nJSON doesn't offer a native way to store dates or timestamps.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1272819-1274596","score":21.414448,"text":"\nAny volume of 7.8 TB or larger reaches the maximum limit at 2,040,109,451 inodes.\n\n\n\nTable comparison\nTable 1 shows the maximum number of inodes that are allowed based on the volume size.

If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate. For more information, see the following websites:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant docs on [attachments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments)\n* Detaching IBM Cloudant attachments to [Object Storage](https:\/\/medium.com\/codait\/detaching-cloudant-attachments-to-object-storage-with-serverless-functions-99b8c3c77925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fewer databases are better than many \n\nIf you can, limit the number of databases per IBM Cloudant account to 500 or fewer. While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run. As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00523-10191-11663","score":18.116264,"text":"\n* Attachments aren't backed up by the tools.\n* Backups aren't precisely accurate \"point-in-time\" snapshots.

A useful scenario is scheduling backups by using cron, and automatically uploading data to [Cloud Object Storage](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/object-storage\/solutions?mhq=object%20storage%20public&mhsrc=ibmsearch_a) for long-term retention.\n\n\n\n\n\n Command line scripting examples \n\nYou frequently need to meet the following two requirements:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-backup-and-recovery"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00556-10831-12062","score":17.351141,"text":"\nThe content must be provided by using [BASE64](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Base64) representation, as shown in the example.\n\nA full list of media types is available in the [media types](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Internet_media_typeList_of_common_media_types) article.\n\nSee the following example JSON document that includes an inline attachment of a jpeg image:\n\n{\n\"_id\":\"document_with_attachment\",\n\"_attachments\":\n{\n\"name_of_attachment\": {\n\"content_type\":\"image\/jpeg\",\n\"data\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAA... ...AASUVORK5CYII=\"\n}\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Performance considerations \n\nWhile document attachments are useful, they do have implications for application performance. In particular, having too many attachments can have an adverse performance impact during replication.\n\nFor example, if your application requires storage for multiple images as attachments or includes large images, you must use an alternative [BLOB](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Binary_large_object) storage mechanism to store the images.

However, the user is responsible for provisioning a remote Event Streams instance and managing the replication.\n\nWe suggest a tool like Kafka MirrorMaker to replicate data between clusters. For information about how to run MirrorMaker, see [Event Streams kafka-mirrormaker repository](https:\/\/github.com\/ibm-messaging\/event-streams-samples\/tree\/master\/kafka-mirrormaker).\n\nThe user is also responsible for the backup of message payload data. Although this data is replicated across multiple Kafka brokers within a cluster, which protects against the majority of failures, this replication does not cover a location-wide failure.\n\nTopic names are backed up by Event Streams, although it is recommended good practice for users to back up topic names and the configuration data for those topics.\n\nIf you have configured your Event Streams instance in a Multi-Zone Region, a regional disaster is very unlikely. However, we recommend that users do plan for such circumstances. If a user's instance is no longer available because of a disaster (and a remote DR instance is not already set up), the user should consider configuring a new instance in a new region and restoring their topics and data from backup if available.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00558-1499-3456","score":15.139679,"text":"\nThe available plans include Lite and Standard.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16295-7-1721","score":10.739291,"text":"\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

However, the underlying hardware is shared with other IBM customers. For more information, see [Virtual machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm). You manage the worker nodes through the automation tools that are provided by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, such as the API, CLI, or console. Unlike classic clusters, you don't see VPC compute worker nodes in your infrastructure portal or separate infrastructure bill, but instead manage all maintenance and billing activity for the worker nodes from IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Worker nodes include the same [components](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-archworker-components) as described in the Classic architecture. Community Kubernetes worker nodes run on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64, 16.04 x86_64 (deprecated). \n Cluster networking Your worker nodes are created in a VPC subnet in the zone that you specify. By default, the public and private cloud service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPC VPN on the private network. \n App networking You can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes. For more information, see [Exposing apps with VPC load balancers](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas).

With bare metal machines, you have additional control over the compute host, such as the memory or CPU. This setup eliminates the virtual machine hypervisor that allocates physical resources to virtual machines that run on the host. Instead, all a bare metal machine's resources are dedicated exclusively to the worker, so you don't need to worry about \"noisy neighbors\" sharing resources or slowing down performance. Bare metal servers are dedicated to you, with all its resources available for cluster usage.\n\nEncrypted disks\n: By default, every worker node is provisioned with two local SSD, AES 256-bit encrypted data partitions. The first partition contains the kernel image that is used to boot the worker node and is not encrypted. The second partition holds the container file system and is unlocked by using LUKS encryption keys. Each worker node in a cluster has its own unique LUKS encryption key, managed by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. When you create a cluster or add a worker node to an existing cluster, the keys are pulled securely and then discarded after the encrypted disk is unlocked. Encryption can impact disk I\/O performance. For workloads that require high-performance disk I\/O, test a cluster with encryption both enabled and disabled to help you decide whether to turn off encryption.\n\nExpert AppArmor policies\n: Every worker node is set up with security and access policies that are enforced by [AppArmor](https:\/\/wiki.ubuntu.com\/AppArmor) profiles that are loaded into the worker node during bootstrapping. AppArmor profiles can't be changed by the user or owner of the machine.\n\nSSH disabled\n: By default, SSH access is disabled on the worker node to protect your cluster from malicious attacks. When SSH access is disabled, access to the cluster is forced via the Kubernetes API server. The Kubernetes API server requires every request to be checked against the policies that are set in the authentication, authorization, and admission control module before the request is executed in the cluster.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10394-7-1848","score":16.978851,"text":"\nUpdating Classic worker nodes that use OpenShift Data Foundation \n\nClassic infrastructure\n\nFor Classic clusters with a storage solution such as OpenShift Data Foundation you must cordon, drain, and replace each worker node sequentially.

When updates are available, you are notified when you view information about the master and worker nodes in the IBM Cloud console or CLI, such as with the ibmcloud oc clusters ls or ibmcloud oc workers ls --cluster <cluster_name> commands.

In addition to using the VPC's implicit router function, each of these flows also rely on one of the implicit router's two network address translation (NAT) functions.\n\n\n\n* An explicit one-to-many NAT through a public gateway function that serves all subnets that are connected to it.\n* One-to-one NAT assigned to individual virtual server instances.\n\n\n\nAfter NAT translation, the implicit router forwards these internet-destined packets to the internet, by using the cloud backbone.\n\n\n\n\n\n Life cycle of external IP addresses that are associated with public gateway functions \n\nAs both external IP addresses and PGWs are bound to an availability zone.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13904-0-1404","score":10.373456,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Configuring services \n\nThere are a variety of services running on the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Router Appliance (VRA) that can be configured.\n\nThey include:\n\nvyatta@vrouter set service\n\nPossible completions include:\n\n> connsync        Connection tracking synchronization (conn-sync) service\n> dhcp-relay      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay agent\n> dhcp-server     Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for DHCP server\n> dhcpv6-relay    DHCPv6 Relay Agent parameters\n> dhcpv6-server   DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6) server\n> dns             Domain Name Server (DNS) parameters\n> flow-monitoring Flow-Monitoring traffic monitoring configuration\n> https           Enable\/disable the Web server\n> lldp            LLDP settings\n> nat             Network Address Translation (NAT)\n> netconf         NETCONF (RFC 6241)\n> portmonitor     Portmonitor configuration\n> sflow           sflow configuration for dataplane\n> snmp            Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\n> ssh             Secure Shell (SSH) protocol\n> telnet          Enable\/disable Network Virtual Terminal Protocol (TELNET) protocol\n> twamp           Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol\nShow more\n\nnat is configured as part of the service, and https controls access to the web GUI and the APIs. connsync defines how two VRAs can share connection tracking synchronization for things like stateful firewall failover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-configuring-your-services"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14664-2979-4981","score":10.06086,"text":"\nThis layer virtualizes the physical infrastructure through different VMware products:\n\n\n\n* VMware vSphere virtualizes the physical compute resources.\n* VMware NSX is the network virtualization platform that provides logical networking components and virtual networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Virtualization management \n\nThis layer consists of the following components:\n\n\n\n* vCenter Server Appliance with embedded Platform Services Controller (PSC).\n* For NSX-T - three NSX Manager or Controller nodes (total of three nodes).\n* For NSX-V - one NSX Manager and three VMware NSX Controller\u2122 nodes (total of four nodes).\n* VMware NSX Edge\u2122 Services Gateways (ESGs) - four for NSX-T (two on the management cluster and two on the workload cluster) and two for NSX-V.\n* IBM CloudDriver virtual server instance (VSI).

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Each query result is written by default to a CSV file in a Cloud Object Storage instance where you created the integration. But you can freely override and customise the format and Object Storage location as part of the SQL statement that you run.\n\nYou can use a custom INTO clause of a SELECT statement to control where and how result data from a SELECT statement is written to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\nGetting started using SQL Query SELECT statements from inside your instance is as easy as creating an integration. Objects of queryable data formats, as well as folders with multiple objects of a consistent queryable format (when shown in the \"folders\" view) are labeled as shown in Figure 4.\n\nZoom\n\n![Object with SQL label](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/63322f2f3a72050206eb05ba7f590fdcb741105c\/cloud-object-storage\/images\/accessible-using-sql.jpg)\n\nFigure 4.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-sql-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02522-13463-15240","score":9.489834,"text":"\nFor example, to get the list of actions for a user, you can run the following query:\n\nSELECT _source.eventTime, _source.action, _source.o_target.name\nFROM cos:\/\/eu-gb\/sql-results\/jobid=3aa9e732-ba88-4ffe-b9fc-b8a265876467 STORED AS PARQUET\nWHERE _source.o_initiator.name = \"xxx@ibm.com\"\nORDER BY _source.eventTime\nINTO cos:\/\/eu-gb\/sql-results STORED AS CSV\n\nFor example, to get the event time, the action, the criticality of the action, and the outcome, you can run the following query:\n\nSELECT _source.eventTime AS EVENTTIME, _source.action AS ACTION, _source.severity AS SEVERITY, _source.outcome AS OUTCOME FROM PARQUET_FILE STORED AS PARQUET\nINTO RESULTS_BUCKET STORED AS CSV\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 3.7.

Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore.

For information about use cases for relevancy training, see [Improve your natural language query results from Watson Discovery](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/blogs\/improving-your-natural-language-query-results-from-watson-discovery\/).\n\nTo train Watson, you must provide the following:\n\n\n\n* Example queries that are representative of the queries your users enter\n* Ratings that indicate which results for each query are relevant and not relevant\n\n\n\nAfter Watson has enough training input, the information that you provide about which results are good and bad for each query is used to learn about your collection. Watson does not just memorize, but it also learns from the specific information about individual queries and applies the patterns it detects to all new queries. It does so, using machine-learning Watson techniques that find signals in your content and questions. After training, Discovery then reorders the query results to display the most relevant results at the top. As you add more and more training data, Discovery becomes more accurate in the ordering of query results.\n\nRelevance training currently applies only to natural language queries in private collections. It is not intended for use with structured Discovery Query Language queries.

Make sure your queries are written the way your users would ask them. Also, it is recommended that training queries be written with some term overlap between the query and the desired answer. This overlap improves initial results, when the natural language query is run.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-tooling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13075-5007-7084","score":10.177652,"text":"\nTo return to the main Build queries screen at any time, click Build queries on the upper left.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

Relevancy Training - Relevancy training computes features for each top-level text field (fields at the same level as document_id in the JSON) in the collection. If there are many top level fields, this can cause a performance impact for a natural_language_query when using training. Reducing the number of top level fields can improve performance. This can be done via normalization or by manually editing the JSON to put fields that are not helpful to finding relevant content in a nested structure.

The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase.

In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

That means that you do not need to worry about storage used by replicas (as all topics have their replication factor set to 3) that is not taken from the usable storage. This keeps things simple and you can plan how to map the retention of those messages to storage usage.\n\n\n\n Understanding how Kafka stores data \n\nKafka allows users to configure retention limits on topics.\n\nThe retention.bytes configuration is the total number of bytes allocated for messages for each partition of the topic. If it is exceeded, Kafka deletes oldest messages. So for example, if you are generally sending in 200 MB a day of messages to a single partition topic, and you want to keep them for 5 days, set retention.bytes to 1 GB (200 MB x 5 days).\n\nIf this was over 10 partitions, then you would set retention.bytes = 100 MB (1 GB \/ 10 partitions).\n\nInternally Kafka splits each partition into log segments. This again is a property that you can set, log.segment.size, the default is 512 MB. When we mentioned that Kafka deletes the oldest messages, it really deletes the oldest log segment.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

It searches for passages that have an approximate length of 200 characters, then looks at chunks of content that are twice that length to find passages that contain full sentences. Sentence boundary detection works for all supported languages and uses language-specific logic.\n\nFor all project types except Conversational Search, you can change how the passages are displayed in the search results from the Customize display > Search results page.

Click Open document list to return to the list of documents for this task and click Submit All Documents to submit the documents for approval.\n\n> Note: In a realistic situation, you would create many more annotations and complete all the documents in the set before submitting.\n10. Close this annotation set, and then open the other annotation set in the Test task.\n\nDepending on how you set up the annotation tasks and which users you assigned them to, you might need to log in to Knowledge Studio as the user who is assigned to the other annotation set in the annotation task.\n11. Repeat the same annotations in the Technology - gmanews.tv document, except this time, use the employedBy relation instead of the founderOf relation.\n\nLogging in as another user will help illustrate inter-annotator agreement in the next lesson.

After you complete the annotations for the second annotation set, click Submit All Documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lesson 5: Analyzing inter-annotator agreement \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to compare the work of multiple human annotators in Knowledge Studio.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nTo determine whether different human annotators are annotating overlapping documents consistently, review the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores.\n\nKnowledge Studio calculates IAA scores by examining all overlapping documents in all document sets in the task, regardless of the status of the document sets. The IAA scores show how different human annotators annotated mentions, relations, and coreference chains. It is a good idea to check IAA scores periodically and verify that human annotators are consistent with each other.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-wks_tutml_intro"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16410-6875-8784","score":12.468654,"text":"\nTo add an annotation set in one task to a different task, you must first delete the task where the annotation set is active.\n* If you delete a human annotator's user account, it affects their annotations too.

Type system changes can affect annotations; human annotators might need to review and update their documents.\n* If the dictionaries change, the changes are not reflected in the current annotation task.

To later use inter-annotator scores to compare the annotations that are added by each human annotator, you must assign at least two human annotators to different annotation sets. You must also specify that some percentage of documents overlap between the sets.\n\n> Note: In a realistic scenario, you would create as many annotation sets as needed, based on the number of human annotators who are working in the workspace. In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

Unlike classic clusters, VPC cluster worker nodes on shared hardware don't appear in your infrastructure portal or a separate infrastructure bill. Instead, you manage all maintenance and billing activity for the worker nodes through Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. Your worker node instances are connected to certain VPC instances that do reside in your infrastructure account, such as the VPC subnet or storage volumes. For dedicated hosts, the dedicated host price covers the vCPU, memory, and any instance storage to be used by any workers placed on the host.

This operator deploys instances of the certificate authority (CA), peer, ordering nodes and the IBM Blockchain Platform console that uses to manage the blockchain components on your network. This deployment option is available for OpenShift clusters that are running in IBM Cloud or your cloud.\n\n\n\n What is Red Hat Marketplace? \n\nRed Hat Marketplace is available directly from your OpenShift web console. It provides an open cloud catalog that makes it easier to discover and access certified software for container-based environments in public clouds. With automated deployment, software is immediately available to deploy on any Red Hat OpenShift cluster, providing a fast, integrated experience. Discover and buy certified software, and quickly deploy. Access open source and proprietary software, with responsive support, streamlined billing and contracting, simplified governance, and single-dashboard visibility across clouds. Built in partnership by Red Hat and IBM, this marketplace helps organizations deliver enterprise software and improve workload portability.\n\nRed Hat Marketplace provides a simplified alternative method for deploying an instance of the IBM Blockchain Platform to your cluster instead of the [manual deployment steps](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain-sw-254?topic=blockchain-sw-254-deploy-ocp) or by using [Ansible playbook](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain-sw-254?topic=blockchain-sw-254-ansible) scripts.\n\nWith just a few simple steps, you can get started with the IBM Blockchain Platform. After you install the operator to your OpenShift project, you can create a subscription that allows you to deploy the blockchain console UI.\n\nCurrently, you cannot deploy certificate authorities (CAs), peers, and ordering nodes directly, then, use the console to deploy those nodes instead. This tutorial includes only instructions for installing the console.\n\nTo learn more about the Marketplace see the [Red Hat documentation](https:\/\/marketplace.redhat.com).\n\n\n\n\n\n Limitations","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-deploy-ocp-rhm"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10568-22837-24687","score":20.665491,"text":"\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, you have [a mix of flavors](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-planning_worker_nodesplanning_worker_nodes) that you can deploy: from bare metal for intensive workloads to virtual machines for rapid scaling.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there.

Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04149-3050-4970","score":15.0633745,"text":"\nSelect Let's get started from the welcome page to begin setting up CIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

This tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again. This challenge is based on the visitor's IP, and therefore does not apply to challenges presented by WAF rules because they are based on an action that the user performs on your site.\n* Security level - Sets the security level of your website to determine which visitors receive a challenge page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04334-74160-75348","score":17.045122,"text":"\n* lockdowns: Lock access to URLs in this domain to only permitted addresses or address ranges.\n\n\n\n-d, --domain\n: DNS Domain ID.

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions. All objects in the bucket must be set with anonymous read or public read access.\n\nFor more information, see [Accelerate delivery of static files using a CDN](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-static-files-cdn).\n\n\n\n\n\n Path-based CDN mappings","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02342-3424-4412","score":7.7455664,"text":"\nThe topic must end with the pattern .?.log, implying any single character between the periods . followed by the log string.\n\n{\n\"type\": \"access\",\n\"subjects\": [\n{\n\"attributes\":\n{\n\"name\": \"iam_id\",\n\"value\": \"IBMid-12345\"\n}\n]\n}\n],\n\"roles\": [\n{\n\"role_id\": \"crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Writer\"\n}\n],\n\"resources\": [\n{\n\"attributes\":\n{\n\"name\": \"accountId\",\n\"value\": \"d727f71e99b14534b3267fab8cc9b09a\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"serviceName\",\n\"value\": \"messagehub\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"resourceType\",\n\"operator\": \"stringEquals\"\n\"value\": \"topic\",\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"resource\",\n\"operator\": \"stringMatch\",\n\"value\": \"dev-topic-{{}}-{{?}}.?.log\"\n}\n]\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\nOn the line \"value\": \"dev-topic-{{}}-{{?}}.?.log\", the {{}} indicates the character * and the {{?}} indicates the character ?.

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions.

For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

See [Assistants](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants).\n* Built-in integrations: Instead of going to the Deploy tab to deploy your workspace, you add your dialog skill to an assistant, and add integrations to the assistant through which the skill is made available to your users. You do not need to build a custom front-end application and manage the conversation state from one call to the next. However, you can still do so if you want to. See [Adding integrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add) for more information.\n* New major API version: A V2 version of the API is available. This version provides access to methods you can use to interact with an assistant at run time. No more passing context with each API call; the session state is managed for you as part of the assistant layer.\n\n\n\nWhat is presented in the tooling as a dialog skill is effectively a wrapper for a V1 workspace. There are currently no API methods for authoring skills and assistants with the V2 API. However, you can continue to use the V1 API for authoring workspaces.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03049-7-1790","score":12.863388,"text":"\nAdding a dialog skill \n\nThe natural-language processing for the Watson Assistant service is defined in a dialog skill, which is a container for all of the artifacts that define a conversation flow.\n\nYou can add one dialog skill to an assistant.\n\n\n\n Create the dialog skill \n\nYou can create a skill from scratch, use a sample skill that is provided by IBM, or import a skill from a JSON file.\n\nTo add a skill, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09913-7-1696","score":10.056946,"text":"\nLanguage support \n\nNatural Language Understanding supports a variety of languages depending on which features you analyze.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Adding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03120-4813-6717","score":9.907109,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois\/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12655-1658-4229","score":13.298986,"text":"\nThe encryption process manages keys that are generated by a commercially available key management service such as IBM\u00ae Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services.\n\nApplication performance is minimally impacted allowing for enterprise workflows to continue to operate in a secure environment.

This encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Masking: \n\nData Security Broker can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys.

This technology allows end users to encrypt entirely within the instance, and can provide additional protection for sensitive data in-transit between the instances and the physical drive media.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash.

You decide whether to [import your existing root keys](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-import-root-keys), or have Hyper Protect Crypto Services [generate root keys on your behalf](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-root-keys). \n Confidentiality and integrity protection Hyper Protect Crypto Services uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Cipher Blocker Chaining (CBC) mode to create and protect keys. When you create keys in the service, Hyper Protect Crypto Services generates them in the Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance and the master key encrypts the keys to ensure only you have the access. \n Cryptographic shredding of data If your organization detects a security issue, or your application no longer needs a set of data, you can choose to shred the data permanently from the cloud. When you delete a root key that protects other DEKs, you ensure that the keys' associated data can no longer be accessed or decrypted. \n Delegated user access control By assigning Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, Hyper Protect Crypto Services supports a centralized access control system to enable granular access for your keys.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-envelope-encryption"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16035-7-2023","score":12.659959,"text":"\nAbout data encryption for VPC \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae takes security seriously and understands the importance of encrypting data to keep it safe.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14916-7-2291","score":15.07305,"text":"\nOverview \n\nUse IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud to create your own space in IBM Cloud\u00ae.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload.

Data encryption with your own root keys is available by using a supported key management service (KMS).\n\nVPN for VPC does not store any customer data other than what is required to configure VPN gateways, connections, and policies. Data that is transmitted through a VPN gateway is not encrypted by IBM. Data about your specific VPN and policy configurations are encrypted in transit and at rest. VPN configuration data is deleted upon your request through API or User Interface.\n\n\n\n How your data is stored and encrypted in VPC \n\nAll block storage volumes are encrypted by default with IBM-managed encryption. IBM\u00ae-managed keys are generated and securely stored in a block storage vault that is backed by Consul and maintained by IBM Cloud\u00ae operations.\n\nFor more security and control, you can protect your data with your own root keys (also called a customer root key or CRK). This feature is commonly called Bring Your Own Key, or BYOK. Root keys encrypt the keys that safeguard your data. You can import your root keys to Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Services, or have either key management service create one for you.\n\nThe KMS stores your key and makes it available during volume and custom image encryption. Key Protect provides FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance. Hyper Protect Crypto Services offers the highest level of security with FIPS 140-2 Level 4 compliance.

The terminology is used throughout this architecture solution.\n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region. A region is also often referred to a multizone region or MZR.\n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center, which hosts the compute, network, storage resources, and the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other, so to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the range of addresses in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vpc-ryo-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14438-7-1796","score":8.393646,"text":"\nIBM Cloud Direct Link overview \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Direct Link offerings provide connectivity from an external source into a customer IBM Cloud private network.

To achieve the same goal with Cloud Functions, you can run them across as many availability zones or regions as you like, without having to pay a penny of incremental costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Web apps \n\nGiven Cloud Functions\u2019s event-driven nature, it offers several benefits for user-facing applications, whereas the HTTP requests coming from the user\u2019s browser serve as the events. Cloud Functions applications use compute capacity and billed only when they are serving user requests. Idle standby or waiting mode is nonexistent. This feature makes Cloud Functions considerably less expensive when compared to traditional containers or Cloud Foundry applications. Both of those tools have idle time, waiting for inbound user requests, and you are billed for all that \u201csleeping\u201d time.\n\nFull web application can be built and run with Cloud Functions. Combining serverless APIs with static file hosting for site resources such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, means that you can build entirely serverless web applications. The simplicity of operating a hosted Cloud Functions environment is not having to operate anything at all. Since Cloud Functions is hosted on IBM Cloud, it is a great benefit when compared to standing up, and operating a Node.js Express or other traditional server runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n IoT \n\nInternet of Things scenarios are often inherently sensor-driven. For example, an action in Cloud Functions might be triggered if a need to react to a sensor that exceeds a specific temperature. IoT interactions are usually stateless with the potential of high load in major spontaneous events such as natural disasters, significant weather storms, or traffic jams. A need is created for an elastic system where normal workload might be small, but needs to scale quickly with predictable response time. So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10170-10609-12793","score":9.978862,"text":"\nThus, the annual rollout of benefits is a key aspect of fostering an employee-centered culture.\n\nThey need a solution that helps the Developers and their users.\n\n\n\n* FRONT-END TO EXISTING BENEFITS: insurance, educational offerings, wellness, and more\n* REGION-SPECIFIC FEATURES: each country has unique HR policies so that the overall site might look similar but show region-specific benefits\n* DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY TOOLS that accelerate rollout of features and bug fixes\n* CHATBOT to provide authentic conversations about benefits and resolve users requests and questions efficiently.\n\n\n\nTechnical solution:\n\n\n\n* Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud\n* IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery\n* IBM Logging and Monitoring\n* IBM\u00ae Secure Gateway for IBM Cloud\u00ae\n* IBM Cloud App ID\n\n\n\nAccelerated development is a key win for the HR Exec.

IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Application modernization on IBM Cloud \n\nApplication modernization is a term that describes the process of transitioning existing applications to use new approaches on the cloud. Customers today are seeking innovative, efficient approaches that help them make this transition based on business and application complexity.\n\nBusiness pressures demand faster time to market. Your existing estate includes not only applications, but data, processes, business logic, and user interfaces, all of which need to adapt to keep up with new business demands.\n\nApplication modernization has the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* Improved developer productivity\n* Increased operational efficiency\n* Reduced cost to build new capabilities\n* Expanded capacity delivered in a short time\n\n\n\nIBM understands that 70% of private cloud adoption is driven by the need to modernize application environments. However, most organizations are approaching application modernization in a staged approach, which requires a hybrid and multi cloud landscape, where:\n\n\n\n* Complex and monolithic legacy applications that typically run on mainframes or UNIX systems remain on-premises.\n* x86 environments used for Systems of Record (SoR), applications that are security sensitive, and regulated workloads are placed on a virtualized infrastructure or a private cloud.\n* Applications such as SAP\u00ae or high-performance computing use bare metal resources.\n* Security sensitive and some regulated workloads, which can move to the public cloud are moving to dedicated environments.\n* Systems of engagement (SoE) such as web, mobile, IoT, AI, or Video are moving to public clouds.\n\n\n\nFor example, a common pattern is to have front-end SOE applications that are deployed as containers with databases and legacy middleware that are deployed on VMs on a private cloud.\n\nBecause your IT infrastructure and business needs are unique, you need an approach to modernization that helps accelerate business value delivery, reduces your risks, and preserves your existing investments.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vcs-openshift-intro"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01447-1492-3786","score":9.435397,"text":"\nVulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings.

You can use the \/dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the \/dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

You want the simple assistant to answer user questions about the restaurant, its menu, and to cancel customer cake orders. Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input. The General_About_You intent that is provided with the General content catalog serves a similar function, but its user examples are designed to focus on queries about the assistant as opposed to the business that is using the assistant to help its customers. So, you will add your own intent.\n\n\n\n Add the about_restaurant intent \n\n\n\n1. From the Intents tab, click Create intent.\n\n![Shows the the Create intent button on the Intents page.]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03185-6701-8694","score":10.923258,"text":"\n[A sample dialog tree with example content](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/dialog-depiction-full.png)\n\nThe dialog tree in this diagram contains two root dialog nodes. A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03071-7-2056","score":10.911377,"text":"\nTutorial: Adding a node with slots to a dialog \n\nIn this tutorial, you will add slots to a dialog node to collect multiple pieces of information from a user within a single node.

The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree.

For example, if the source document contains the sentence Murder on the Orient Express made headlines, then how you define entity types to capture the key information in the sentence differs depending on the type of application that will use the model that you build with the type system.\n\n\n\n* For a literary application, you might create types that capture this information:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-typesystem"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02877-32997-34608","score":10.901581,"text":"\nSee [Creating entities](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-entities) for more details.\n\nIf you want to change the decimal placement for a number, to reformat a number as a currency value, for example, see the [String format() method](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-methodsjava.lang.String).\n\n\n\n toDouble() \n\nConverts the object or field to the Double number type.

You can call this method on any object or field. If the conversion fails, null is returned.\n\nIf you specify a Long number type in a SpEL expression, you must append an L to the number to identify it as such. For example, 5000000000L. This syntax is required for any numbers that do not fit into the 32-bit Integer type. For example, numbers that are greater than 2^31 (2,147,483,648) or lower than -2^31 (-2,147,483,648) are considered Long number types.

For example, if a user asks for store locations, you could show a map and display a button for each store location that the user can click to get address details. To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response.

For each intent, you add sample utterances that reflect the input customers might use to ask for the information they need, such as, What time do you open?\n\nOr use prebuilt content catalogs that are provided by IBM to get started with data that addresses common customer goals.\n* Dialog: Use the dialog tool to build a dialog flow that incorporates your intents. The dialog flow is represented graphically in the tool as a tree. You can add a branch to process each of the intents that you want your assistant to handle.\n* Entities: An entity represents a term or object that provides context for an intent. For example, an entity might be a city name that helps your dialog to distinguish which store the user wants to know store hours for. After you add entities, update your dialog to use them. Add dialog nodes that handle the many possible permutations of a request based on the entities that are found in the user input.\n\n\n\nAs you add training data, a natural language classifier is automatically added to the skill. The classifier model is trained to understand the types of requests that you teach your assistant to listen for and respond to.\n3. Create a search skill. Configure a connection to a Discovery instance. If the dialog is configured to perform a search or is not designed to answer a particular type of question, the assistant searches the configured external data sources to find a response.\n4.

Depending on whether recovery crypto units are assigned to your instance, the plug-in provides two ways for instance initialization: by using recovery crypto units and by using key part files.\n\nOperational crypto unit\n: Each service instance is composed of multiple operational crypto units. The operational crypto units are located in different availability zones of the same region for high availability. They are used to manage encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations. The number of crypto units that you specify when you create your instance is the number of operational crypto units.\n\nRecovery crypto unit\n: The purpose of recovery crypto units is to generate a random master key value and to save a backup copy of the master key value. You can use recovery crypto units to load the master key and restore the master key when it is destroyed or lost.\n\nCurrently, recovery crypto units are enabled only in the region of Dallas (us-south) and Washington DC (us-east). If you create your instance in either of the two regions, two recovery crypto units are automatically assigned to your instance without extra costs: one is in the us-south; the other is in the us-east.\n\nIf smart cards are used to load the master key, the recovery crypto units are not applicable and can be ignored. The backup of the master key relies on the backup of the smart cards in that case.\n\nFailover crypto unit\n: Failover crypto units back up the operational crypto units in another region, which includes keystores that store encryption keys. When a regional disaster occurs, you can use failover crypto units to ensure production workloads and avoid data loss.\n\nCurrently, failover crypto units are available only in the region of Dallas (us-south) and Washington DC (us-east).

Resource quotas determine the deployment constraints for a project, such as the number of Kubernetes resources that you can deploy, and the amount of CPU and memory that can be consumed by those resources. After you set a quota, users must include resource requests and limits in their deployments.\n* Shared cluster resources: If you run multiple tenants in one cluster, some cluster resources, such as the Red Hat OpenShift router, Ingress application load balancer (ALB) or available portable IP addresses are shared across tenants. Smaller services might have a hard time using shared resources if they must compete against large services in the cluster.\n* Updates: You can run one Red Hat OpenShift API version at a time only. All apps that run in a cluster must comply with the current Red Hat OpenShift API version independent of the team that owns the app. When you want to update a cluster, you must ensure that all teams are ready to switch to a new Red Hat OpenShift API version and that apps are updated accordingly. This also means that individual teams have less control over the Red Hat OpenShift API version they want to run.\n* Changes in cluster setup: If you want to change the cluster setup or reschedule workloads onto new worker nodes, you must roll out this change across tenants. This roll out requires more reconciliation and testing than in a single-tenant cluster.\n* Communication process: When you manage multiple tenants, consider setting up a communication process so that tenants know where to go when an issue with the cluster exists, or when they need more resources for their services. This communication process also includes informing your tenants about all changes in the cluster setup or planned updates.\n\n\n\nAlthough single-tenant and multi-tenant clusters come with roughly the same costs, single-tenant clusters provide a higher level of isolation than the projects in a multi-tenant cluster. For better workload isolation, use single-tenant clusters.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12266-7-2085","score":10.409832,"text":"\nService limitations \n\nReview the following limitations for IBM Cloud Schematics.\n\n\n\n Differences to native Terraform \n\nIf you used native Terraform before and plan to migrate your Terraform templates to IBM Cloud Schematics, make sure that you understand the differences between the services to adjust your template.\n\n\n\n Do I need to provide an IBM Cloud API key in the provider block? \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae API key is essential to authenticate with the IBM Cloud platform, receive the IAM token and IAM refresh token that Schematics requires to work with the resource's API, and to determine the permissions that you were granted.

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.

In subscription billing, you purchase a subscription for an amount of credit to spend during the subscription term, and usage is deducted from the subscription credit at a discounted rate.

However, you can still import these accounts into your enterprise by converting them to Subscription accounts and then importing them. To convert an account, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud?contactmodule).\n\nEach enterprise supports only a single billing currency.

Databases for EnterpriseDB deployments have a minimum of 20 GB of disk and 1 GB of RAM per data member.\n\n\n\n Using the Pricing Calculator \n\nTemplates are provided for ease of use and provide balanced resource allocations appropriate for general purpose workloads.

If your backup storage utilization is greater than 60 GB for the month (in this scenario), you are charged an overage of $0.03\/month per gigabyte.\n\nBy default, Cloud Databases provides a daily backup that is stored for 30 days. These backups, and any on-demand backups you make, all count toward the above allocation.\n\nIn the above example, if your database contains 2 GB of data and you have not taken any on-demand backups, then your total backup size is 2 GB x 30 = 60 GB. Your backup costs are nil.\n\nIf your database contains 15 GB of data and you have not taken any on-demand backups, then your total backup size is 15 GB x 30 = 450 GB.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=databases-for-enterprisedb-pricing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10906-10094-12223","score":16.712563,"text":"\n<br><br> * Activate a subscription code<br><br><br> With an IBM Cloud subscription, you get discounted usage for platform services and support by committing to a minimum spending commitment for a certain period of time.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question.

If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts.

For a new bucket, ensure that you are creating the bucket in a [supported region](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage\/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-availabilityservice-availability), and then choose the Add retention policy option. For an existing bucket, ensure that it has no objects and then navigate to configuration settings and click the Create policy button below the bucket retention policy section. In either case, set a minimum, maximum, and default retention periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the REST API, Libraries, and SDKs \n\nSeveral new APIs have been introduced to the IBM Cloud Object Storage SDKs to provide support for applications working with retention policies.

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word \u201cimmutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption. When enable and two backup infrastructure components need to communicate, a dynamic key is generated by the backup server and communicated to each node over a secure channel.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-cr-sa-lhr"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04939-64122-65726","score":6.619869,"text":"\nSystem.out.printf(\"New retention period on %s is %sn\", objectName, additionalSeconds);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n List legal holds on a protected object \n\nThis operation returns:\n\n\n\n* Object creation date\n* Object retention period in seconds\n* Calculated retention expiration date based on the period and creation date\n* List of legal holds\n* Legal hold identifier\n* Timestamp when legal hold was applied\n\n\n\nIf there are no legal holds on the object, an empty LegalHoldSet is returned.

Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":12.073308,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":8.767137,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04175-0-1274","score":9.182531,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04177-1842-4099","score":10.527086,"text":"\nTo return to normal operation, click Deactivate mode in the notification banner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring and managing your DNS \n\nGo to the Reliability section, click the DNS tab and add a record. Type in the information about your DNS record and then click Add record to implement your changes.\n\nAfter creating your records, consider turning on the Proxy setting. Most of the features of CIS require that the internet traffic to your site flow through CIS infrastructure. In other words, it only applies to proxied records and load balancers. To really reap the benefit of CIS, make sure that your DNS records and load balancers have the proxy setting enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting up and manage your caching \n\nNext, you can set up caching. You have the option of three types of caching, available from the caching screen list menu.\n\n\n\n* No query string: Only delivers resources from cache when there is no query string.\n* Query string independent: Delivers the same resource to everyone independent of the query string. The Ignore Query String setting applies only to static file extensions. This setting removes the query string when generating the cache key, so that a request for style.css?something is normalized to style.css when serving from the cache.\n* Query string dependent: Delivers a different resource each time the query string changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge cache \n\nYou can purge your cache to prepare for updates at any time by entering the URL into the purge cache field. You can purge a single file or multiple files (up to 30 at a time).\n\n\n\n\n\n Browser expiration \n\nYou can use the list menu to select the time of browser expiration that you require; for example, 8 hours, or 1 day.\n\nEnterprise only: You can also instruct CIS not to override browser cache control by setting this to Respect Existing Headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using Development mode \n\nDevelopment mode is intended for use when major updates or new file uploads are required, or any time you do not want the end users to work from the cache at all, but to retrieve files directly from the origin servers. To begin using Development Mode, toggle the switch to Enabled position. To stop using Development Mode, toggle the switch to Disabled position. Development mode expires automatically after 3 hours.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04175-0-1274","score":10.508496,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match. A third party cannot use the hash without a copy of the original data.\n\nIt is important to be aware with this option that while Orgs A and B cannot see the actual ledger data because it is hashed, they are still able to see that Orgs C and D are transacting and can see the volume of transactions that are occurring between them.\n\nAlso, consider that data inside a private data collection can be purged from the peers that store it.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08218-7896-10171","score":10.715878,"text":"\nAfter you complete these steps, the secure network management agent starts listening on the specified network port and is ready to accept requests from the secure network management CLI.

Declared vulnerabilities that aren't fixed yet, or are not going to be fixed, are not reported by Vulnerability Advisor. Therefore, if Vulnerability Advisor does not report any vulnerabilities, there might still be a risk in the image.\n\nFor version 3, the scanning of an image is triggered in one of the following ways:\n\n\n\n* When a new image is pushed to the registry.\n* When a new security notice is released for a package that is installed in the image, the image is queued for scanning, which might take some time to complete.\n* While an image is tagged in the registry, it is scanned every week.\n\n\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023. For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nFor version 4, the image is indexed the first time that it is pushed. Thereafter, the vulnerability assessment is calculated every time Vulnerability Advisor is queried about that image.\n\nThe following tables show the supported Docker base images that Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09410-1574-3779","score":10.911248,"text":"\n* IBM Cloud Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM.\n* The IBM Cloud Container Registry includes Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae.

When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.

You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

Additionally, your worker nodes can be up to two versions behind the master version (n-2).\n\nFor example, if your current Kubernetes API server version is 1.18 (n) and you want to update to 1.20, you must first update to 1.19 (n+1) and then to 1.20 (n+2). Next, you can update the worker nodes up to two version ahead, such as 1.18 to 1.20 (n+2).\n\nIf your cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version, follow the [version archive instructions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsk8s_version_archive). To avoid getting in an unsupported state and operational impact, keep your cluster up-to-date.\n\nCan my worker nodes run a later version than the master?\n: Your worker nodes can't run a later major.minor Kubernetes version than the master.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-update"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10392-102583-103538","score":16.07469,"text":"\nUpdate your cluster to at least [version 4.6](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_versions) as soon as possible.\n\nMaster fix pack and worker node fix pack update\n: Change log documentation is available for OpenShift version [4.8.11_1526_openshift and 4.8.12_1527_openshift](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_48).\n\n\n\n\n\n 27 September 2021 \n\nMaster fix pack update\n: Change log documentation is available for version [4.7.30_1532_openshift](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_474730_1532),[4.6.44_1556_openshift](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_464644_1556), [4.5.41_1552_openshift](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-changelog_archive4541_1552), and [3.11.521_1604_openshift](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_311311521_1604).\n\nWorker node fix pack update","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-relnotes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10246-15672-17685","score":16.034513,"text":"\nDuring the update, your highly available master can continue processing requests, and your app workloads and worker nodes continue to run.

If the update is unsuccessful, the master returns to a deployed state and continues running the previous version. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can check if the update failed in the Master Status field. \n update_cancelled The master update is canceled because the cluster was not in a healthy state at the time of the update. Your master remains in this state until your cluster is healthy and you manually update the master. To update the master, use the ibmcloud oc cluster master update[command](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_cluster_update). If you don't want to update the master to the default major.minor version during the update, include the --version option and specify the latest patch version that is available for the major.minor version that you want, such as 1.26.

IT expenses soared because hardware quickly went out of date and wasn't utilized fully. While they waited for hardware provisioning, their regulatory compliance slowed.\n\n\n\n Context \n\nTo improve risk analysis, the company looked to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and IBM Cloud Analytic services to reduce costs, increase worldwide availability, and ultimately accelerate regulatory compliance. With IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service in multiple regions, their analysis apps can be containerized and deployed across the globe, improving availability and addressing local regulations. Those deployments are accelerated with familiar open source tools, already part of IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nThey started by containerizing the analysis apps and putting them in the cloud. In a flash, their hardware headaches went away. They were able to easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their high-performance CPU, RAM, storage, and security needs. And when their analysis apps change, they can add or shrink compute without huge hardware investments. With the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance. Their predictive and risk analytics functions, such as Monte Carlo calculations, are now constantly updated through iterative agile deployments. Container orchestration is handled by a managed Kubernetes so that operations costs are reduced too.

Users with a Basic, Advanced, or Premium [support plan](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/get-support?topic=get-support-support-plans) can create a technical support case by attaching a specific resource or product to ensure that the case gets to the correct support engineer faster. This allows for a more efficient and effective resolution.\n\nIf your account is deactivated or if you don't have access to your account, you can create a support case by completing the [Create an Account, Login or Billing Request](https:\/\/watson.service-now.com\/x_ibmwc_open_case_app.do!\/create) form.\n\nYou can also create support cases for issues that are associated with access (IAM), billing & usage, account, and invoice or sales inquiries. The types of available support depend on the support level of the account. Your support plan also determines the severity level that you can assign to support cases. For more information, see [Case severity and response time](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity).\n\nUsers with a Lite account can also create support cases, but are limited to issues associated with access (IAM), billing & usage, account, and invoice or sales inquiries.

This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.

To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent.

In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

In other words, if you take your design document _design\/fetch and create an exact duplicate _design\/fetch_OLD, then both endpoints would work interchangeably without triggering any reindexing.\n\nTo switch to the new view, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Create a duplicate copy of the design document that you want to change, for example by adding _OLD to its name: _design\/fetch_OLD.\n2. Put the new or \"incoming\" design document into the database by using a name with the suffix _NEW: _design\/fetch_NEW.\n3. Query the fetch_NEW view to ensure that it starts to build.\n4. Poll the _active_tasks endpoint and wait until the index is finished building.\n5. Put a duplicate copy of the new design document into _design\/fetch.\n6.

It can be installed by using the following command:\n\nnpm install -g couchmigrate\n\nTo use the couchmigrate script, first define the URL of the CouchDB\/IBM Cloudant instance by setting an environment variable called COUCH_URL. Run the following command to define the URL for the IBM Cloudant instance:\n\nexport COUCH_URL=https:\/\/127.0.0.1:5984\n\nThe URL must start with https:\/\/ and can include authentication credentials.

Later, a developer wants to access the contents of your storage bucket. The developer sends a request to retrieve the value of your IAM credential.\n4. Secrets Manager validates the request and generates a single-use API key that the developer can use to authenticate to Cloud Object Storage. After the API key reaches the end of its lease, the API key is revoked automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-tutorial-access-storage-bucket"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00373-7-2065","score":10.005585,"text":"\nAccelerate a dynamic website using Dynamic Content Acceleration \n\nThis tutorial may incur costs.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11857-1988-2975","score":15.262172,"text":"\nSatellite-enabled IBM Cloud services \n\nEach IBM Cloud service instance that you create in your Satellite location incurs charges.

After the subscription expires, your account is converted to a Pay-As-You Go account, which means you pay only for billable services that you use with no contracts or commitments. The discounts that are associated with the subscription account won't apply to the Pay-As-You-Go account. The IBM Sales team is happy to help extend your subscription before you reach its expiration date. If you extend your subscription within 30 days from the expiration date, you won't get charged at the Pay-As-You-Go account rate. After 30 days, you are invoiced as a Pay-As-You-Go account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03704-10459-12479","score":18.301563,"text":"\n* Compare the date of your invoice to the start and end dates of the promo code.
