Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

It is unusual among trophies to include winning members ' names . Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted . Initially a new band added each year , though this caused the trophy to grow in size , earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup '' . In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom . It has been referred to as The Cup , Lord Stanley 's Cup , The Holy Grail , or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug .

The German word for them is Meerschweinchen , literally `` little sea pig '' , which has been translated into Polish as \u015bwinka morska , into Hungarian as tengerimalac , and into Russian as \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 . This derives from the Middle High German name merswin . This originally meant `` dolphin '' and was used because of the animals ' grunting sounds ( which were thought to be similar ) . Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_212-587-0-375", "score": 16.092932, "text": "Guinea pig\nDomestic guinea pig Two adult guinea pigs Conservation status Domesticated Scientific classification Kingdom : Animalia Phylum : Chordata Class : Mammalia Order : Rodentia Family : Caviidae Genus : Cavia Species : C. porcellus Binomial name Cavia porcellus ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) Synonyms Mus porcellus Cavia cobaya Cavia anolaimae Cavia cutleri Cavia leucopyga Cavia longipilis", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_1090-1588-0-498", "score": 16.07386, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean groups , especially as a food source , but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies .

Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

Many soldiers in his army were Christians , and his army was his base of power . With Licinius , ( Eastern Roman emperor ) , he issued the Edict of Milan which mandated toleration of all religions in the empire . The edict had little effect on the attitudes of the people . New laws were crafted to codify some Christian beliefs and practices . Constantine 's biggest effect on Christianity was his patronage . He gave large gifts of land and money to the Church and offered tax exemptions and other special legal status to Church property and personnel . These gifts and later ones combined to make the Church the largest landowner in the West by the 6th century . Many of these gifts were funded through severe taxation of pagan cults . Some pagan cults were forced to disband for lack of funds ; when this happened the Church took over the cult 's previous role of caring for the poor .

Christians ' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life , which caused non-Christians -- including government authorities -- to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire . In addition , the peculiar intimacy of Christian society and its secrecy about its religious practices spawned rumors that Christians were guilty of incest and cannibalism ; the resulting persecutions , although usually local and sporadic , were a defining feature of Christian self - understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century . A series of more centrally organized persecutions of Christians emerged in the late 3rd century , when emperors decreed that the Empire 's military , political , and economic crises were caused by angry gods . All residents were ordered to give sacrifices or be punished . Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Jewish Tax . Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000 . Many fled or renounced their beliefs . Disagreements over what role , if any , these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and Novatianist schisms . Relations between the Church and the Empire were not consistent : `` Tiberius wanted to have Christ placed in the Pantheon and refused first of all to persecute the Christians . Later on his attitude changed . ( - ) How are we to explain the fact that men like Trajan and above all Marcus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Christians ? On the other hand Commodus and other villainous emperors rather favoured them . '' In spite of these persecutions , evangelization efforts persisted , leading to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in 313 . By 380 , Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman Empire . Religious philosopher Simone Weil wrote : `` By the time of Constantine , the state of apocalyptic expectation must have worn rather thin . ( The imminent coming of Christ , expectation of the Last Day - constituted ' a very great social danger . ' ) Besides , the spirit of the old law , so widely separated from all mysticism , was not so very different from the Roman spirit itself . Rome could come to terms with the God of Hosts .

Another theory sees the rhyme as connected to Mary , Queen of Scots ( 1542 -- 1587 ) , with `` how does your garden grow '' referring to her reign over her realm , `` silver bells '' referring to ( Catholic ) cathedral bells , `` cockle shells '' insinuating that her husband was not faithful to her , and `` pretty maids all in a row '' referring to her ladies - in - waiting -- `` The four Maries '' . In Disney 's The Truth About Mother Goose the `` silver bells '' are said to `` refer to the elaborate decoration on her dresses '' , the `` cockle shells '' to her love of exotic food such as cockles , with the `` pretty maids all in a row '' referring to her ladies - in - waiting . Mary has also been identified with Mary I of England ( 1516 -- 1558 ) with `` How does your garden grow ? '' said to refer to her lack of heirs , or to the common idea that England had become a Catholic vassal or `` branch '' of Spain and the Habsburgs . It is also said to be a punning reference to her chief minister , Stephen Gardiner . `` Quite contrary '' is said to be a reference to her unsuccessful attempt to reverse ecclesiastical changes effected by her father Henry VIII and her brother Edward VI .

One day , the giant is awakened by a linnet , and discovers that spring has returned to the garden , as the children have found a way in through a gap in the wall .

Bigger , more diverse and deep pocketed coalitions tend to be more effective in outside lobbying , and the `` strength in numbers '' principle often applies . Interest groups try to build `` sustainable coalitions of similarly situated individual organizations in pursuit of like - minded goals '' . According to one study , it is often difficult for a lobbyist to influence a staff member in Congress directly , since staffers tend to be well - informed and subject to views from competing interests . As an indirect tactic , lobbyists can try to manipulate public opinion which , in turn , can sometimes exert pressure on congresspersons . Activities for these purposes include trying to use the mass media , cultivating contacts with reporters and editors , encouraging them to write editorials and cover stories to influence public opinion , which may have the secondary effect of influencing Congress . According to analyst Ken Kollman , it is easier to sway public opinion than a congressional staff member since it is possible to bombard the public with `` half - truths , distortion , scare tactics , and misinformation . '' Kollman suggests there should be two goals : ( 1 ) communicate that there is public support behind an issue to policymakers and ( 2 ) increase public support for the issue among constituents . Kollman suggested outside lobbying was a `` powerful tool '' for interest group leaders . In a sense , using these criteria , one could consider James Madison as having engaged in outside lobbying , since after the Constitution was proposed , he wrote many of the 85 newspaper editorials arguing for people to support the Constitution , and these writings later became the Federalist Papers . As a result of this `` lobbying '' effort , the Constitution was ratified , although there were narrow margins of victory in four of the state legislatures . Lobbying today generally requires mounting a coordinated campaign , using targeted blitzes of telephone calls , letters , emails to congressional lawmakers , marches down the Washington Mall , bus caravans , and such , and these are often put together by lobbyists who coordinate a variety of interest group leaders to unite behind a hopefully simple easy - to - grasp and persuasive message .", "title": "Lobbying in the United States", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "853841453_33885-34065-0-180", "score": 7.101977, "text": "Society of the United States\nAs with other Western countries , the United States has now a substantial proportion of children born outside of marriage : in 2010 , 40.7 % of all births were to unmarried women .", "title": "Society of the United States", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_13486-14754-0-1268", "score": 11.812045, "text": "Guinea pig\nDomestic guinea pigs generally live in cages , although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets .

This concept was first introduced by the text MUD Avalon : The Legend Lives . An analogy can be made to the reload time and firing rate of weapons . For example , a machine gun has very fast firing rate , so it has a very low cooldown between shots . Comparatively , a shotgun has a long cooldown between shots . Cooldown can be used to balance a weapon such as a turret - mounted machine gun having infinite ammunition , since it can only sustain continuous fire until reaching a threshold at which the weapon would have to cool down ( hence the term ) before it could be fired again . In design terms , cooldown can be thought of as an inverted ' casting time ' where instead of requiring a wait time before using an ability , cooldown may replace casting time and put the wait after the ability is activated . This creates a new dimension to the balancing act of casting speed versus power : `` lower cooldown , faster cast , but weaker strength '' versus `` higher cooldown , slower cast , but greater strength '' . This mechanic is integral to such games as World of Warcraft , where cooldown management is key to higher - level play and various abilities deal with cooldown ( for example , cooldown reduction or immediately finishing cooldown on certain abilities ) . From the technical point of view , cooldown can also be used to assert control over frequency of cast in order to maintain a fluid frame rate and ping . For example , in the game Diablo II , cooldown was added in the form of a patch to several graphically and CPU - intensive spells to solve the problem of extreme lag caused by players spamming ( ie : repeatedly casting at maxed out cast rates ) these spells in multiplayer games . Moves and attacks in fighting games ( like those from the Street Fighter series ) are measured in animation frames ( which may be 1 / 20th to 1 / 60th of a second per frame ) . Each move has a certain number of frames in which it is considered to be `` recovering '' before another move can be executed , which is similar to cooldown in concept .", "title": "Glossary of video game terms", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "813625590_696-1387-0-691", "score": 6.2471814, "text": "Annealing (metallurgy)\nIn annealing , atoms migrate in the crystal lattice and the number of dislocations decreases , leading to a change in ductility and hardness .

Some cities have dealt with this by adding large storage tanks or ponds to hold the water until it can be treated . Chicago has a system of tunnels , collectively called the Deep Tunnel , underneath the city for storing its stormwater . In many areas detention tanks or roof detention systems are required to be installed for a property and are used to temporarily hold rainwater runoff during heavy rains and restrict the outlet flow to the public sewer . This lessens the risk of the public sewer being overburdened during a heavy rain . An overflow outlet may also be utilized which connects higher on the outlet side of the detention tank . This overflow would prevent the detention tank from completely filling up .

The need for irrigation led the Sumerians , and later the Akkadians , to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers . Major cities , such as Ur and Uruk , took root on tributaries of the Euphrates , while others , notably Lagash , were built on branches of the Tigris . The rivers provided the further benefits of fish ( used both for food and fertilizer ) , reeds , and clay ( for building materials ) . With irrigation , the food supply in Mesopotamia was compabale to the Canadian prairies . The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the Fertile Crescent , which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile . Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops , portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable . This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia . Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts . Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley , onions , grapes , turnips , and apples . Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine . As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian , farmers did not depend on slaves to complete farm work for them , but there were some exceptions . There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical ( i.e. the escape / mutiny of the slave ) . Although the rivers sustained life , they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities . The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers ; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept . Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils , leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad , further north .", "title": "Mesopotamia", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "834226571_765-1254-0-489", "score": 13.716259, "text": "Storm drain\nDrains are fed by street gutters on most motorways , freeways and other busy roads , as well as towns in areas which experience heavy rainfall , flooding and coastal towns which experience regular storms .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_446-1385-0-939", "score": 12.705801, "text": "Infertility\nIn humans , infertility is the inability to become pregnant or carry a pregnancy to full term .

Corporation : The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners . Corporations can be either government - owned or privately owned . They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations . A privately owned , for - profit corporation is owned by its shareholders , who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff .

Cooperative : Often referred to as a `` co-op '' , a cooperative is a limited - liability business that can organize as for - profit or not - for - profit . A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members , not shareholders , and they share decision - making authority . Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives . Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy .

The poem tells of a king , now identified as King Xuan ( r . 827 -- 782 BC ) of the Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046 -- 771 BC ) , who commanded General Nan Zhong ( \u5357\u4ef2 ) to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the Xianyun . The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 -- 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( \u6210 \u5468 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 -- 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1,400 metres ( 4,600 feet ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in Hancheng , Shaanxi .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today .

In modern weddings , the bride generally picks red ( following Chinese tradition ) or white ( more Western ) for the wedding , but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquet . Traditionally , the groom is not responsible for the cost of the wedding invitation sweet treats ( often pastries ) , the banquet invitations , and the wedding itself . Wedding banquets are elaborate and consist usually of 5 - 10 courses , with ingredients such as shark fin , abalone , lobster , squab , sea cucumber , swift nests or fish roe in soup or as decoration on top of a dish to symbolize fertility , and local delicacies . Traditionally , the father of the bride is responsible for the wedding banquet hosted on the bride 's side and the alcohol consumed during both banquets . The wedding banquets are two separate banquets : the primary banquet is hosted once at the bride 's side , the second banquet ( smaller banquet ) at the groom 's side . While the wedding itself is often based on the couple 's choices , the wedding banquets are a gesture of thanks and appreciation , to those that have raised the bride and groom ( such as grandparents and uncles ) . It is also to ensure the relatives on each side meet the relatives on the other side . Thus out of respect for the elders , wedding banquets are usually done formally and traditionally , which the older generation is thought to be more comfortable with . On the night of the wedding day , there was a custom in some places for relatives or friends to banter the newlyweds . Though this seemed a little noisy , both of them dropped shyness and got familiar with each other .", "title": "Chinese marriage", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "866379367_3921-4374-0-453", "score": 9.78175, "text": "Jewish wedding\nThe bride traditionally walks around the groom three or seven times when she arrives at the Chuppah .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

Of all Shakespeare 's plays , the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was Macbeth , as Chinese audiences saw in a play first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland a parallel with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s . The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and furthermore , the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power - hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing . Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' .

The date of the first performance is unknown . The First Quarto , printed in 1597 , says that `` it hath been often ( and with great applause ) plaid publiquely '' , setting the first performance before that date . The Lord Chamberlain 's Men were certainly the first to perform it . Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare , the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors , Will Kemp , instead of Peter , in a line in Act Five . Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo , being the company 's actor , and Master Robert Goffe ( a boy ) the first Juliet .

He begins with a 14 - line prologue in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet , spoken by a Chorus . Most of Romeo and Juliet is , however , written in blank verse , and much of it in strict iambic pentameter , with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare 's later plays . In choosing forms , Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it . Friar Laurence , for example , uses sermon and sententiae forms , and the Nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech . Each of these forms is also moulded and matched to the emotion of the scene the character occupies . For example , when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play , he attempts to use the Petrarchan sonnet form . Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain , as in Romeo 's situation with Rosaline . This sonnet form is used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man . When Romeo and Juliet meet , the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan ( which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare 's day ) to a then more contemporary sonnet form , using `` pilgrims '' and `` saints '' as metaphors . Finally , when the two meet on the balcony , Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love , but Juliet breaks it by saying `` Dost thou love me ? '' By doing this , she searches for true expression , rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love . Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo but uses formal language with Paris . Other forms in the play include an epithalamium by Juliet , a rhapsody in Mercutio 's Queen Mab speech , and an elegy by Paris . Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play , though at times he uses it for other characters , such as Mercutio . Humour , also , is important : scholar Molly Mahood identifies at least 175 puns and wordplays in the text . Many of these jokes are sexual in nature , especially those involving Mercutio and the Nurse .", "title": "Romeo and Juliet", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "806376271_50387-51434-0-1047", "score": 11.100677, "text": "Romeo and Juliet\nThe play is sometimes given a historical setting , enabling audiences to reflect on the underlying conflicts .

A mock - Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet 's final scene ( with a happy ending , Romeo , Juliet , Mercutio , and Paris restored to life , and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris 's love , Benvolia , in disguise ) forms part of the 1980 stage - play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby .

The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and furthermore , the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power - hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing . Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' .

The theme of a religious conflict between a Jewish merchant vs. a Christian merchant in The Merchant of Venice is generally ignored in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice as most Chinese find do not find the theme of Jewish - Christian conflict relevant. , Unlike in Western productions , the character of Shylock is very much an unnuanced villain in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice , being presented as a man capable only of envy , spite , greed and cruelty , a man whose actions are only motivated by his spiritual impoverishment . By contrast , in the West , Shylock is usually presented as a nuanced villain , of a man who has never held power over a Christian before , and lets that power go to his head . Another popular play , especially with dissidents under the Communist government , is Hamlet . Hamlet , with its theme of a man trapped under a tyrannical regime is very popular with Chinese dissidents with one dissident Wu Ningkun writing about his time in internal exile between 1958 - 61 at a collective farm in a remote part of northern Manchuria that he understood all too well the line from the play `` Denmark is a prison !

While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome , Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia , and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution . MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951 , which determined that he had defied the orders of the president and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit .
