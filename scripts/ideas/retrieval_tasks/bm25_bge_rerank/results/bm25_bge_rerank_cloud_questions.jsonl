These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00513-7-2197", "score": 0.7076270580291748, "text": "\nDatabase overview \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae databases contain JSON objects.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created.

This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance. The Standard plan's smallest capacity has 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 20 GB of storage for USD$76.65 per month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-migrating-to-ibm-cloudant-on-ibm-cloud"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00576-7385-9302", "score": 0.6695342063903809, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly. Deleting an IBM Cloudant document leaves a tombstone document behind, so don't rely on deleting documents to recover disk space.

Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database.

A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-7918-10060", "score": 0.7355678677558899, "text": "\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier.

This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00513-7-2197", "score": 0.717565655708313, "text": "\nDatabase overview \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae databases contain JSON objects.

For more information, see [partitioned databases](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databasespartitioned-databases-database).\n\nThe [Grouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudantgrouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant) guide provides an example of how documents for an e-commerce application might be used within an IBM Cloudant database.\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases \n\nIBM Cloudant supports two types of databases:\n\n\n\n* Partitioned\n* Nonpartitioned\n\n\n\nA partitioned database offers significant query performance and cost advantages but requires you to specify a logical partitioning of your data. The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned. The default for partitioned is false, maintaining compatibility with an earlier version.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-37889-39953", "score": 0.7016270160675049, "text": "\nIf you need to access objects within documents, you can use standard dot notation for example, address.zipcode to access a postal code string inside an address object.\n\nWe can also add the following parameters:\n\nFields\n: Specifies the document attributes that we want returned (the default is the entire document).\n\nSort\n: Defines how the data is to be sorted. Sort is an array, allowing the sort to be calculated on multiple attributes.\n\nLimit\n: The number of documents to return.\n\nIf you are from a relational database background, this query is the equivalent SQL query to that last IBM Cloudant query example.\n\nThe WHERE clause is the equivalent of SELECTOR in IBM Cloudant Query. ORDER and LIMIT are exactly equivalent, and the IBM Cloudant Query FIELDS list is equivalent to the comma-separated list of attributes after the SELECT keyword.\n\nThe JSON syntax might take a bit of getting used to, but MongoDB users might find it familiar.\n\nIBM Cloudant queries can be executed in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. Select the database that you are working with, for example, books then choose the Query tab.\n\nEnter your IBM Cloudant Query JSON in the box that is provided, and click Run Query when you're ready. The result set appears on the page.\n\nThe Explain button is used to provide an explanation on how the database interprets the supplied query. This explanation becomes more important when we get to Indexing in the next part.\n\nQueries can be triggered from curl too. The Query JSON, in this case, is stored in a file and we POST to the _find endpoint by using the -d@ command-line syntax.\n\nThe Node.js code is similar. The Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century.

You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06968-15099-17180", "score": 0.7156330347061157, "text": "\n[checkmark icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/icons/checkmark-icon.svg) \n\n\n\n\n\n* PDF files that are secured with a password or certificate are not supported.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned. The default for partitioned is false, maintaining compatibility with an earlier version.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases"}]}

You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant. We could decide to add the \"address\" object only to the following documents:\n\n\n\n* Documents that are created from now on.\n* Only documents that we have addresses for.\n\n\n\nIn other words, documents of the same type can have fields present or missing.\n\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database.

We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier. You must definitely avoid patterns that rely on updating the same document over and over in a small time window.\n\n\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00576-7385-9302", "score": 0.7336588501930237, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier. You must definitely avoid patterns that rely on updating the same document over and over in a small time window.\n\n\n\nThat's the end of this part.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly. Deleting an IBM Cloudant document leaves a tombstone document behind, so don't rely on deleting documents to recover disk space. Instead, you must rely on deleting whole databases.\n\nJSON doesn't offer a native way to store dates or timestamps.

You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00510-7123-9213", "score": 0.7941334843635559, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00576-6036-7924", "score": 0.7732713222503662, "text": "\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/databases-for-postgresql).\n* Data warehouse for ad hoc querying.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type.

Its bigger brother, the Standard Plan, is a paid-for service where you specify the number of reads, writes, and queries per second for your application and that capacity is reserved for you. You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06968-16615-18789", "score": 0.7618775367736816, "text": "\nThe number of documents that are allowed per service instance depends on your Discovery plan type.\n\nThe document limit applies to the number of documents in the index.

You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database.

We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier. You must definitely avoid patterns that rely on updating the same document over and over in a small time window.\n\n\n\nThat's the end of this part.

You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.

You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate.

While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

Fill out form fields to configure your instance\n\n\n\n Querying Object Storage with SQL Query \n\nYou can use SQL Query to create SELECT statements only; actions such as CREATE, DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE are not possible.\n\nInput data for your queries are read from ORC, CSV, JSON, or Parquet files located in one or more IBM Cloud Object Storage instances. Each query result is written by default to a CSV file in a Cloud Object Storage instance where you created the integration. But you can freely override and customise the format and Object Storage location as part of the SQL statement that you run.\n\nYou can use a custom INTO clause of a SELECT statement to control where and how result data from a SELECT statement is written to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\nGetting started using SQL Query SELECT statements from inside your instance is as easy as creating an integration. Objects of queryable data formats, as well as folders with multiple objects of a consistent queryable format (when shown in the \"folders\" view) are labeled as shown in Figure 4.\n\nZoom\n\n![Object with SQL label](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/63322f2f3a72050206eb05ba7f590fdcb741105c/cloud-object-storage/images/accessible-using-sql.jpg)\n\nFigure 4.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-sql-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13492-5987-7955", "score": 0.6691704988479614, "text": "\nFor example, you can run some setup queries writing to cos://us-geo/my-bucket/tempstore, where each query creates new objects inside that prefix with a distinct jobid=<job_id> name. You can then run an aggregate query over all of the setup results by using cos://us-geo/my-bucket/tempstore as a [composite input table](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-readingcompositeInput). The aggregate query treats jobid as if it were a column in the input table (for example, in a WHERE clause). This concept is the Hive-style partitioning concept that Hadoop SQL engines employ for data that is stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).\n\nIf you want to run a query over the combined results of multiple previous queries, ensure that these have compatible outputs so that their schemas can be merged. For more information, see the section on [composite input tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-readingcompositeInput). To make this work properly for CSV format, all setup queries must use the same column names and sequence in their SELECT clause, so the results have compatible schemas. If you later need to introduce new columns in extra setup queries, add these columns to the end of the column list. If not, the structure of the composite tempstore data set gets corrupted, causing unreadable objects, corrupted data, or unreliable results.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cloud Object Storage endpoints \n\nYour Cloud Object Storage instance has one of the supported endpoints.

Several factors play a role when it comes to how much data needs to be accessed to run a query. First, data layout is important. Columnar formats, such as Parquet, lead to less data to be scanned, as Data Engine can selectively read ranges and single columns. Furthermore, the actual object layout determines how many objects need to be scanned. Read [How to lay out big data in IBM Cloud Object Storage for Spark SQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout) for more details on how to lay out big data on Cloud Object Storage to improve cost and performance of SQL queries. Each successful query is charged with at least 10 MB.\n\n\n\n Example \n\nAssume you have 1 PB of data that is stored on Cloud Object Storage that is laid out as described in the [blog post](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout) and is optimized for the queries you want to run. If you run a single query, the most expensive query possible is SELECT * FROM, as reading 1 PB of data is required. Any other query is much cheaper and faster. For example, a 1 PB data set consists of audit events for users of a system (user A performed action B in system X at time T) and the data is laid out in a way that it is partitioned by time (one file per day and system). So to answer a query like SELECT DISTINCT user FROM WHERE System='X' AND Day >= (TODAY - 30), Data Engine must access all objects for system X that contain data for the last 30 days. The sum of the size of these objects is the maximum estimate of data that is scanned that you would be charged for. But as Data Engine accesses only one field, and data is stored as Parquet, it is much less. Calculating the precise price of the query is not possible in advance because much of it depends on the data itself. Parquet, for example, stores compressed columns, so if the column can be compressed effectively, even less data needs to be read.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overview"}]}

Each query result is written by default to a CSV file in a Cloud Object Storage instance where you created the integration.

You can then run an aggregate query over all of the setup results by using cos://us-geo/my-bucket/tempstore as a [composite input table](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-readingcompositeInput). The aggregate query treats jobid as if it were a column in the input table (for example, in a WHERE clause). This concept is the Hive-style partitioning concept that Hadoop SQL engines employ for data that is stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).\n\nIf you want to run a query over the combined results of multiple previous queries, ensure that these have compatible outputs so that their schemas can be merged. For more information, see the section on [composite input tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-readingcompositeInput). To make this work properly for CSV format, all setup queries must use the same column names and sequence in their SELECT clause, so the results have compatible schemas.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition.

See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query.

For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-7-2240", "score": 0.7607051730155945, "text": "\nSQL reference \n\n\n\n Introduction \n\nWith IBM Cloud\u00ae Data Engine, you can analyze and transform open data with SQL. It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

The Target location field displays where the result is stored. An initial bucket in one of your Object Storage instances is automatically created for you when you open the UI. It is then chosen as your default location, if your query does not specify an INTO clause. To ensure the automatic setup of an initial bucket, do the following steps in advance:\n\n\n\n* You must create an Object Storage instance.\n* You must have at least 'Writer' access to the corresponding Object Storage bucket.\n\n\n\nIn the Details tab of the selected job, you can set any location that you specified in the INTO clause as your default location.\n3.

Catalog syntax is compatible with Hive metastore syntax. See how to [work with the catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogusage) and refer to the [Catalog management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterHiveCatalog) section of the SQL reference.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\nYou can explore, change, or discover structured data on [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/getting-started.htmlgetting-started-console) with Data Engine by using SQL syntax. To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors.

If your data is small, this full-scan lookup doesn\u2019t matter, but as the data set grows, performance becomes a problem for you, and for the cluster as a whole. It is likely that we will limit this facility soon. The IBM Cloudant Dashboard provides a method for creating indexes in an easy way.\n\nCreating indexes and crafting IBM Cloudant Queries that take advantage of them requires some flair. To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index. Some examples exist where this type of indexing is abused either deliberately, or mostly by mistake. Plan your indexing to comprise only the fields required by your actual queries. Indexes take up space and can be costly to rebuild if the number of indexed fields are large.\n\nWe also have the issue of which fields that you store in an IBM Cloudant Search.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-1605-3435", "score": 0.7269824743270874, "text": "\nThus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Each common table expression that is specified can also be referenced by name in the FROM clause of subsequent common table expressions.\n\nCreating a common table expression avoids the overhead of creating and dropping an intermediate result object on Cloud Object Storage that is needed only for a certain query.\n\nMoreover, a common table expression is beneficial when the same result table must be shared in a fullselect.\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nThe common table expression examples use values clauses to define tables inline.

You can view the scores by comparing a pair of human annotators (for example, compare all of John's mention annotations to all of Mary's mention annotations). You can also view the scores by comparing specific documents (for example, compare the relation annotations that John made in one document to the relation annotations that Mary made in the same document).\n\nTo help you identify areas that require investigation, scores that fall below the value that you specified for the inter-annotator agreement threshold are highlighted in red. In early stages of your annotation project, you might find that relation scores are often worse than mention scores because a perfect relation annotation requires that the mentions that define the relationship be in agreement first.\n\nThe score in the All column is a Fleiss Kappa score.

In addition, the automation deploys an extra virtual server instance (shown as the Login Node in the architecture diagram) so you can easily build and assemble applications for your cluster right away.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift for HPC enables three interfaces: UI, API, and CLI. The UI involves use of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation. Any updates that are needed post-deployment regarding Red Hat OpenShift configuration or setup should be performed by using Red Hat OpenShift tools and commands.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there.

Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-faq"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04195-6086-8151", "score": 0.7893071174621582, "text": "\nBecause CIS doesn't support email traffic by default, you must set the PTR record to the location of your email server.

You can import multiple files, one at a time, as long as the total number of records is under the max limit. After importing, you are shown a summary with the number of records successfully added and the number that failed, along with the reason why each record failed.\n\nExport records - Use Export records to create a backup of your zone file, or export it to use with another DNS provider. When this menu option is clicked, the records are downloaded to the location specified by your browser settings (typically the Downloads folder). To select another folder location, change your browser's settings to prompt you for a location with each download.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring and managing your secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally sign DNS data so you can be assured it is valid.

This example uses the GoDaddy domain registrar. Your case might be different, depending on which registrar you use.\n\n\n\n1.  Deploy a CIS instance by using the IBM Cloud console or API.\n\nIt is recommended that you mirror the name of your CIS instance with the domain or subdomain.\n2.  Click Let\u2019s get started.\n3.  Enter the subdomain in the Domain name field and click Connect and continue.\n4.  For new subdomains click Next Step, for existing subdomains click Import records.\n5.  Make note the New NS records for entry into the GoDaddy DNS Management system.\n6.  Log in to GoDaddy domain Registrar.\n7.  Navigate to the DNS Management page for the candidate CIS domain.

After the NS Records are DNS propagated, it is reflected in the DNS tools, and you are ready to proceed.\n13. With completed NS propagation, click Check name servers.\n14. CIS starts checking NS configuration for the subdomain and might be in a Pending State.\n\nAny typographical errors in can produce a \"silent\" failure. If your subdomain is in the pending state for more than 30 minutes, you might have an error.\n\n\n\nUpon successful subdomain name server and NS record confirmation, the CIS instance reports Active.

You might start with a rolling deployment or instantaneous switch before you progress to a more complicated canary deployment.\n\nRolling deployment\n: You can use Kubernetes-native functionality to create a v2 deployment and to gradually replace your previous v1 deployment. This approach requires that apps are compatible with earlier version so that users who are served the v2 app version don't experience any breaking changes. For more information, see [Managing rolling deployments to update your apps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update_appapp_rolling).\n\nInstantaneous switch\n: Also referred to as a blue-green deployment, an instantaneous switch requires double the compute resources to have two versions of an app running at once. With this approach, you can switch your users to the newer version in near real time. Make sure that you use service label selectors (such as version: green and version: blue) to make sure that requests are sent to the correct app version. You can create the new version: green deployment, wait until it is ready, and then delete the version: blue deployment.

For rapid rollback while deployment is in progress, you can route all of the traffic to the original production environment. Since this strategy requires two full production environments only during deployment, the overall resource usage is lower than for the Blue-Green deployment. The Canary release deployment strategy is the slowest to move from a previous release to a current release of the software that is being deployed. Canary deployments allow organizations to test two different software versions side by side in production.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you start this tutorial, make sure that you have the following resources in place:\n\n\n\n* An [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration), with a Standard plan.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-vpc"}]}

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

This status informs you about the criticality of the information it reports on.\n\nFor example, you can set up Monitoring to send alert notifications to IBM Cloud Event Notifications.\n\n\n\n* [Sending email notifications to IBM Cloud Event Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-tutorial)\n* [Sending SMS notifications to IBM Cloud Event Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-tutorial-en-sms)\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Working with alerts and events](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-alerts).\n\n\n\n\n\n Data location \n\nMetric data is hosted on the IBM Cloud.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-monitor"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13406-3429-5587", "score": 0.6658471822738647, "text": "\nThe service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-36856-39124", "score": 0.6687721014022827, "text": "\nAfter you identify the list of steps, you can then focus on writing engaging content to turn each interaction into a positive experience for your customer.\n\nDate and time response types\n: New to action skills, these response types allow you to collect date and time information from customers as they answer questions or make requests.\n\nNew built-in variables\n: Two kinds of built-in variables are now available for action skills.\n\n\n\n* Set by assistant variables include the common and essential variables Now, Current time, and Current date.\n* Set by integration variables are Timezone and Locale and are available to use when connected to a webhook or integration.\n\n\n\nUniversal language model now generally available\n: You now can build an assistant in any language you want to support.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

You can restore volumes during instance creation or when you want to create stand-alone boot or data volumes to be used later. You can restore a data volume to add more storage to an existing instance. You can use backup snapshots to restore volumes in a different region for business continuity purposes or geographic expansion. You can restore volumes from backup snapshots in the UI, from the CLI, with the API, or Terraform.\n\n\n\n About restoring a volume from a backup snapshot \n\nWhen you restore a volume from a backup, the service creates another volume. The restored volume inherits the same [profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), capacity, data, and metadata as the original volume. However, you can choose a different profile and capacity if you prefer. If the source volume used [customer-managed encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-customer-managed-encryption), the new volume inherits that encryption.\n\nRestoring a volume from a backup snapshot creates a boot or data volume, depending on whether the snapshot is bootable or nonbootable. The volume appears first as pending while it's being created. During the restoration, your data is copied from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC. After the volume is hydrated (fully provisioned), you can use the new boot or data volume. For more information about how performance is affected during restoration, see [Performance impact when backup snapshots are used](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restorebaas-performance-considerations).\n\nFor best performance, use backups with fast restore. You can enable fast restore backup snapshots in multiple zones and use them to restore a volume that is fully provisioned when the volume is created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore"}]}

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02873-7-1949", "score": 0.7437945604324341, "text": "\nDialog overview \n\nThe dialog uses the intents that are identified in the user's input, plus context from the application, to interact with the user and ultimately provide a useful response.\n\nThe dialog matches intents (what users say) to responses (what the bot says back).

The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on.

For a real application, you need to define some more interesting intents, some entities, and a more complex dialog that uses them both. When you have a polished version of the assistant, you can make API calls to it from your client application.\n\n\n\n* Complete follow-on tutorials that build more advanced dialogs:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-getting-started"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02882-9742-11807", "score": 0.710680365562439, "text": "\nFor example, you can use the syntax: @us_phone.groups[1] == '617' See [Storing and recognizing pattern entity groups in input](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tipsdialog-tips-get-pattern-groups) for more information.\n* Intent: The simplest condition is a single intent. The node is used if, after your assistant's natural language processing evaluates the user's input, it determines that the purpose of the user's input maps to the pre-defined intent. Use the syntax, intent_name. For example, weather checks if the user input is asking for a weather forecast.

The response might be the answer to a question such as What are your store hours? or the execution of a command, such as placing an order. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree. Create a branch to process each intent that you want your conversation to handle. A branch is composed of multiple nodes.\n\n\n\n Dialog nodes \n\nEach dialog node contains, at a minimum, a condition and a response.\n\n![Shows user input going to a box that contains the statement If: CONDITION, Then: RESPONSE](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/node1-empty.png)\n\n\n\n* Condition: Specifies the information that must be present in the user input for this node in the dialog to be triggered. The information is typically a specific intent. It might also be an entity type, an entity value, or a context variable value.

Just be sure to create the skill before you begin this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Add intents and examples \n\nAdd an intent on the Intents tab. An intent is the purpose or goal that is expressed in user input. You will add a #reservation intent that recognizes user input that indicates that the user wants to make a restaurant reservation.\n\n\n\n1. From the Intents page of the tutorial skill, click Add intent.\n2. Add the following intent name, and then click Create intent:\n\nreservation\n\nThe #reservation intent is added. A number sign () is prepended to the intent name to label it as an intent. This naming convention helps you and others recognize the intent as an intent. It has no example user utterances associated with it yet.\n3. In the Add user examples field, type the following utterance, and then click Add example:\n\ni'd like to make a reservation\n4. Add these additional examples to help Watson recognize the reservation intent.\n\nI want to reserve a table for dinner\nCan 3 of us get a table for lunch?\ndo you have openings for next Wednesday at 7?\nIs there availability for 4 on Tuesday night?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial-slots"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03156-4700-6686", "score": 0.723961591720581, "text": "\n[Screenshot of the field in the node edit view where you add the node purpose summary.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/disambig-node-purpose.png)\n\nDo not add an external node name to the root node that you created in Step 2. When an escalation occurs, your assistant looks at the external node name of the last processed node to learn which user goal was not met successfully. If you include an external node name in the node with the connect to human agent intent, then you will prevent your assistant from learning the last real, goal-oriented node that the user interacted with before escalating the issue.\n\n\n\n4. If a child node in the branch conditions on a follow-up request or question that you do not want the assistant to handle, add a Connect to human agent response type to the node.\n\nFor example, you might want to add this response type to nodes that cover sensitive issues only a human should handle or that track when an assistant repeatedly fails to understand a user.\n\nAt run time, if the conversation reaches this child node, the dialog is passed to a human agent at that point.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00962-3246-5702", "score": 0.5870978832244873, "text": "\nThe Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements.

The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds. Over time, the traffic that is sent to the new version is increased until all of the traffic is sent there, at which point you can stop the old production environment. For rapid rollback while deployment is in progress, you can route all of the traffic to the original production environment. Since this strategy requires two full production environments only during deployment, the overall resource usage is lower than for the Blue-Green deployment. The Canary release deployment strategy is the slowest to move from a previous release to a current release of the software that is being deployed. Canary deployments allow organizations to test two different software versions side by side in production.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you start this tutorial, make sure that you have the following resources in place:\n\n\n\n* An [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration), with a Standard plan.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-vpc"}]}

The problem might be an error in the Dockerfile itself, for example, a syntax error, or in the correctness of the operation that it performs. The problem can also be in your source code, which might fail to compile, for example, if Java\u00ae code is included.\n\nIf you successfully built your project locally, but the same source code does not build in Code Engine, then you might have files available locally that are not in your Git repository. For example, for Node.js projects, it is common to run the npm install command locally so that project dependencies are downloaded and placed in the node_modules directory inside the project directory. It is a good practice to include the node_modules directory in the [.gitignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to keep your Git repository small. A common mistake is to forget to also run npm install (or npm ci) in the Dockerfile. A Docker build that you run locally can access the local node_modules directory, if you copy the whole project into the container, for example, by using the COPY . /app command in the Dockerfile. But, the Code Engine build runs from a freshly checked-out Git repository and cannot access the node_modules directory. Therefore, you must run npm install (or npm ci) in the Dockerfile as part of the build.\n\nA good practice is to include directories like node_modules also in a [.dockerignore file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/dockerignore-file) so that the Docker build that you run locally behaves the same as the Code Engine build.\n\nAnother reason for a project to be successfully built locally but to fail as Code Engine build are security limitations.

You have an appointment for 10:00 AM on Sep 12. See you then!\n\nSuccess! The application now uses the Watson Assistant service to understand natural-language input, and it displays the appropriate responses.\n\nThis simple example illustrates how you can build a custom client app to communicate with the assistant. Of course, a real-world application would use a more sophisticated user interface, and it might integrate with other applications such as a customer database or other business systems. It would also need to send additional data to the assistant, such as a user ID to identify each unique user. But the basic principles of how the application interacts with the Watson Assistant service would remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the v1 runtime API \n\nUsing the v2 API is the recommended way to build a runtime client application that communicates with the Watson Assistant service. However, some older applications might still be using the v1 runtime API, which includes a similar method for sending messages to the workspace within a dialog skill. Note that if your app uses the v1 runtime API, it communicates directly with the workspace, bypassing the skill orchestration and state-management capabilities of the assistant.\n\nFor more information about the v1 /message method and context, see the [v1 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1message).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03118-4-2208", "score": 0.6496058702468872, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience. To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Watson Assistant API overview \n\nYou can use the Watson Assistant REST APIs, and the corresponding SDKs, to develop applications that interact with the service.\n\n\n\n Client applications \n\nTo build a virtual assistant or other client application that communicates with an assistant at run time, use the new v2 API. By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy /message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

If you configure one of the supported contact center integrations, the web chat can open a separate chat window in which the customer can communicate with a live agent.\n\nYour assistant can then initiate a transfer in situations when the assistant is unable to handle a customer's requests.

Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

You have an appointment for 10:00 AM on Sep 12. See you then!\n\nSuccess! The application now uses the Watson Assistant service to understand natural-language input, and it displays the appropriate responses.\n\nThis simple example illustrates how you can build a custom client app to communicate with the assistant. Of course, a real-world application would use a more sophisticated user interface, and it might integrate with other applications such as a customer database or other business systems. It would also need to send additional data to the assistant, such as a user ID to identify each unique user. But the basic principles of how the application interacts with the Watson Assistant service would remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the v1 runtime API \n\nUsing the v2 API is the recommended way to build a runtime client application that communicates with the Watson Assistant service. However, some older applications might still be using the v1 runtime API, which includes a similar method for sending messages to the workspace within a dialog skill. Note that if your app uses the v1 runtime API, it communicates directly with the workspace, bypassing the skill orchestration and state-management capabilities of the assistant.\n\nFor more information about the v1 /message method and context, see the [v1 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1message).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16324-3229-5312", "score": 0.7240407466888428, "text": "\nChoose a narrow set of user goals first. If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant. After your assistant is live, the built-in metrics of active user conversations help you understand what your customers are asking about, how well your assistant is able to meet their needs, and what to focus on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n 3. Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant.

A client action defines a request for a client-side process, in a standardized format that your external client application can understand. Your external client application must use the provided information to carry out the requested action, which can be a local programmatic function, a call to an external service, or any other action the client can perform. The client then returns the result from the action to the dialog, which can process it further, display it to the user, or use it as a condition to determine subsequent flow.\n\nUnlike other action types, a client action does not make a direct call itself. Instead, it simply makes a request for the client application to do something, in the form of an action object that is included in a response from the dialog (along with any output text). This object includes a name identifying the requested action, along with any required parameters and the name of a context variable where the result should be stored. It is the responsibility of the client application to carry out the requested action, store the result in the context, and send it back to the dialog with the next message.\n\nYou might call a client application to do the following types of things:\n\n\n\n* Validate information that you collected from the user.\n* Do calculations or string manipulations on user input that are too complex for supported SpEL expression methods to handle.\n* Get data from another application or service.\n\n\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how client actions work, using the example of an action to get a weather forecast.\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-actions-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03114-14238-16113", "score": 0.6547032594680786, "text": "\n\"object_1\": {\n\"property_1\": \"Another string value\"\n}\n}\n}\n]\n},\n\"user_id\": \"faf4a112-f09f-4a95-a0be-43c496e6ac9a\"\n}\nShow more\n\nYour application can parse and display the data in any way you choose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Implementing option responses \n\nTo show how a client application might handle option responses, which prompt the user to select from a list of choices, we can extend the client example described in [Building a client application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-client). This is a simplified client app that uses standard input and output to handle three intents (sending a greeting, showing the current time, and exiting from the app):\n\nWelcome to the Watson Assistant example!\n>> hello\nGood day to you.\n>> what time is it?\nThe current time is 12:40:42 PM.\n>> goodbye\nOK! See you later.\n\nIf you want to try the example code shown in this topic, you should first set up the required workspace and obtain the API details you will need. For more information, see [Building a client application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-client).\n\n\n\n Receiving an option response \n\nThe option response can be used when you want to present the user with a finite list of choices, rather than interpreting natural language input. This can be used in any situation where you want to enable the user to quickly select from a set of unambiguous options.\n\nIn our simplified client app, we will use this capability to select from a list of the actions the assistant supports (greetings, displaying the time, and exiting). In addition to the three intents previously shown (hello, time, and goodbye), the example workspace supports a fourth intent: menu, which is matched when the use asks to see a list of available actions.\n\nWhen the workspace recognizes the menu intent, the dialog responds with an option response:\n\n{\n\"output\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02872-1338-3179", "score": 0.6544042229652405, "text": "\n* Get data from another application or service.\n\n\n\nFor information about how to call an external service, such as a Cloud Functions web action, see [Making a programmatic call from a dialog node](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-webhooks).\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how you can use a client call to get weather forecast information, and return it to the user.\n\n![Shows someone asking for a weather forecast, the dialog sending a request to a client app, which sends it to the external service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/forecast.png)\n\nNote that the client action calls the MyWeatherFunction program, which is a program that the client application runs. The client application makes the call to the external web service (/weather) to get the actual forecast information. The client application then returns the response to the dialog.

Of course, a real-world application would use a more sophisticated user interface, and it might integrate with other applications such as a customer database or other business systems.

However, some older applications might still be using the v1 runtime API, which includes a similar method for sending messages to the workspace within a dialog skill.

When it receives this response, the client application recognizes that the get_weather action is being requested. It calls an external web service (/weather) to get the actual forecast information, passing any specified parameters (such as the user's location).

As the result, you're billed an overage charge based on 87 GB x 12 hours = 1044 GB hours for that extra space.\n\nOverage is calculated by using the maximum number of GB more than the plan allocation during a particular hour within the billing cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disk overage example \n\nAssume that you start a month of 30 days with a Standard plan service instance that uses 9 GB of storage. Next, your storage increases to 21.5 GB for 15 minutes during the hour beginning at 02:00 of day 3.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public"}]}

This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Comparative analysis of account types\n\n Pay-As-You-Go Subscription Enterprise Savings Plan \n\n Monthly billing Timely billing Timely billing \n Invoiced on monthly consumption Invoices independent of usage Invoiced on monthly consumption \n Best suited for developers and companies Best suited for enterprise organizations Best suited for both developers and enterprise organizations \n\n\n\n\n\n Estimating your costs \n\nAfter you select the type of account that fits your organization's needs, it's time to understand how you will be charged for it. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01705-8543-10743", "score": 0.7621022462844849, "text": "\nLarge organizations and other users with large cloud workloads can benefit from the savings and predictable billing that are provided by subscriptions.

Even if your usage varies from month to month, you get predictable, consistent billing. If your usage exceeds your total subscription amount, you're charged the non-discounted rate for the overage.

The minimum retention period must be less than or equal to the default retention period, which in turn must be less than or equal to the maximum retention period.\n\nA maximum retention period of 1000 years can be specified for the objects.\n\nTo create a retention policy on a bucket, you need Manager role.

An example is an incomplete legal review, where records might need to be accessible for an extended duration beyond the retention period originally set. A legal hold flag can then be applied at the object level. Legal holds can be applied to objects during initial uploads or after an object is written.

Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.7063528299331665, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6511023044586182, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04170-7-2189", "score": 0.6490077376365662, "text": "\nJavaScript detections \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services (CIS) bot features include JavaScript detections.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action. Enter (cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed) into the Expression preview section as a singular rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations \n\n\n\n* If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n\n\n\n* Ensure that anything under /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/ is allowed.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-javascript-detections"}]}

For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Vulnerability Advisor generates a security status report that includes suggested fixes and best practices. Vulnerability Advisor is available in two versions: version 3 and version 4.

Updates can affect the Kubernetes API server version or other components in your Kubernetes master. IBM updates the patch version, but you must update the master major and minor versions.\n\n\n\n About updating the master \n\nHow do I know when to update the master?\n: You are notified in the IBM Cloud console and CLI when updates are available, and can also check the [supported versions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) page.\n\nHow many versions behind the latest can the master be?\n: IBM generally supports three versions of Kubernetes at a time. You can update the Kubernetes API server only to the next version ahead of its current version (n+1). Additionally, your worker nodes can be up to two versions behind the master version (n-2).\n\nFor example, if your current Kubernetes API server version is 1.18 (n) and you want to update to 1.20, you must first update to 1.19 (n+1) and then to 1.20 (n+2). Next, you can update the worker nodes up to two version ahead, such as 1.18 to 1.20 (n+2).\n\nIf your cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version, follow the [version archive instructions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsk8s_version_archive). To avoid getting in an unsupported state and operational impact, keep your cluster up-to-date.\n\nCan my worker nodes run a later version than the master?\n: Your worker nodes can't run a later major.minor Kubernetes version than the master.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10642-2898-4503", "score": 0.7521330118179321, "text": "\nYour worker nodes, apps, and resources continue to run.\n\nCan I roll back the update?\n: No, you can't roll back a cluster to a previous version after the update process takes place.

Review the [Red Hat OpenShift changes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_versions) and make any updates marked Update before master.\n2. Review any [Kubernetes helpful warnings](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/03/warnings/), such as deprecation notices.\n3.

The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another. In any of these cases, you can [check the versions change log](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_versions) for any potential impact and choose to safely use the ibmcloud oc cluster master update[command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_cluster_update) yourself without waiting for the update automation to apply.\n\nUnlike the master, you must update your workers for each patch version.\n\nWhat happens during the master update?\n: Your master is highly available with three replica master pods. The master pods have a rolling update, during which only one pod is unavailable at a time. Two instances are up and running so that you can access and change the cluster during the update. Your worker nodes, apps, and resources continue to run.\n\nCan I roll back the update?\n: No, you can't roll back a cluster to a previous version after the update process takes place.

For example, some recommendations might be more in-depth configuration requirements than your particular processes or standards require. Also, some recommendations are not scored, and don't impact the overall benchmark score.\n\nNext, decide whether the component falls within your responsibility.

If a pod goes down during the master outage, the pod can't be rescheduled until the worker node can reach the Kubernetes API server again.\n\nDuring a master outage, you can still run ibmcloud ks commands against the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API to work with your infrastructure resources, such as worker nodes or VLANs. If you change the current cluster configuration by adding or removing worker nodes to the cluster, your changes don't happen until the master is back up.\n\nDo not restart or reboot a worker node during a master outage. This action removes the pods from your worker node. Because the Kubernetes API server is unavailable, the pods can't be rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-debug_master"}]}

This ensures all request and response data between toolchains, pipelines, and IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager and IBM\u00ae Key Protect provider instances is kept within the in-boundary private IBM Cloud network and does not travel over any public network channels.\n\nIn addition to manually selecting chosen secrets on a one-by-one basis from any bound secrets integrations in a toolchain, the option of using a Secret Hint is also available. This option enables a toolchain template to be predefined with suggested secrets names (also known as Hints) that are a short form secret reference. The format of a secret hint is {vault::secret-name} whereby no secret integration name is included.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

When you set a secure property by using the console in your browser, by calling an API, or by configuring a Terraform resource, the plain text secret might be exposed on your local systems. Plain text secrets are also more difficult to rotate. When a secret, such as an API key, must be rotated, all secure properties that carry the secret value must also be located and updated.\n\nWhen you set a secure property with a secrets reference value, the value is a specially formatted string that refers to the location or address of a secret that is managed within a secrets storage service such as [IBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect), [IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager), or HashiCorp Vault. Although Continuous Delivery actively encrypts and stores the secrets reference value internally, the secret value is not exposed on the client side. When Continuous Delivery must retrieve the secret to perform processing on your behalf, it internally retrieves the value from the referenced secrets store. Secrets references are also resilient to rotation. Typically, when a secret is rotated within a secrets store, the location or address of the secret remains the same.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03729-1672-3956", "score": 0.7302484512329102, "text": "\nServices For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume.

Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03776-3313-5682", "score": 0.7266207337379456, "text": "\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice.

Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03798-0-2240", "score": 0.7205320596694946, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Understanding my invoice \n\nBillable accounts receive a monthly invoice for the usage charges and other fees that are incurred. At any time, you can view your invoice or expected invoiced charges by going to the [Invoices](https://cloud.ibm.com/billing/invoices) page from the billing and usage dashboard in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console.\n\nIf your account is billed through a separate billing platform, you can see the following message on the Invoices page:\n\nThe account is invoiced on a separate billing platform. This page reflects only classic infrastructure charges. To view your official invoice and for any pricing inquiries, visit IBM Invoices.

You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount.

Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}]}

With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-1042894-1044946", "score": 0.7303147315979004, "text": "\nContact an [IBM Cloud Sales](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?contactmodule) representative to request a quote for additional server bandwidth.\n* What's the difference between a Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription account?\n\nWith Pay-As-You-Go accounts, you're billed monthly for your resource usage.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-1033424-1035350", "score": 0.7226740121841431, "text": "\n* How am I charged for support?\n\nIf you have Advanced or Premium support, you can track your monthly support costs.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-1064600-1066235", "score": 0.7055894136428833, "text": "\n* How do I add a new commitment?\n\nContact your [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule) representative to add a new commitment to your account.\n* Why am I getting invoiced for a commitment I didn\u2019t use?\n\nSince you committed to a certain amount for a certain period of time and you didn't reach it, IBM Cloud\u00ae have the rights to charge you with the remaining amount.\n* Can I convert my US-based USD Pay-As-You-Go to a Subscription account?

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.
