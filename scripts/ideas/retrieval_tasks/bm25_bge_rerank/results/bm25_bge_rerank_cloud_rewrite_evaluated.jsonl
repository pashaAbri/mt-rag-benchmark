These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-3166-5282","score":0.7190731764,"text":"\nIt is accessed with an HTTP API and can therefore be accessed by any device on the internet that speaks HTTP: application code, web browser, IoT device, or mobile phone.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06501-7-1686","score":0.7148670554,"text":"\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

For more information, see [partitioned databases](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databasespartitioned-databases-database).\n\nThe [Grouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudantgrouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant) guide provides an example of how documents for an e-commerce application might be used within an IBM Cloudant database.\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases \n\nIBM Cloudant supports two types of databases:\n\n\n\n* Partitioned\n* Nonpartitioned\n\n\n\nA partitioned database offers significant query performance and cost advantages but requires you to specify a logical partitioning of your data. The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned. The default for partitioned is false, maintaining compatibility with an earlier version.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-7918-10060","score":0.7071944475,"text":"\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-6386-8382","score":0.7044415474,"text":"\nIt has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate.

By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

You can then copy and paste the HTML script element into any page or pages on your website where you want users to be able to ask your assistant for help.\n\nTo learn more about how web chat can help your business, read [this Medium blog post](https:\/\/medium.com\/ibm-watson\/building-an-engaging-virtual-assistant-cf39cd0c3730).\n\n\n\n Create a web chat instance to add to your website \n\nTo add the assistant to a web page on your company website, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the Assistants page, click to open the assistant tile that you want to deploy to your site.\n2. From the Integrations section, either click Integrate web chat, or click Add integration, and then choose the Web chat tile.\n\nThe web chat integration is added to your first assistant automatically. If you're using the My first assistant, click the Web chat tile to open the integration that was added for you.\n3. Optional: Change the web chat integration name from Web chat to something more descriptive.\n\nA preview pane is displayed that shows you what the web chat looks like when it is embedded in a web page. If a message is displayed that starts with, There is an error, it means you haven't added a conversational skill to your assistant yet. After you add a skill, you can test the conversation from the preview pane.\n4. Click Create to create a web chat instance.\n\nYou can skip this step if the web chat integration was created for you automatically.\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16334-28517-30318","score":0.66208148,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Create a web chat instance to add to your website](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-task).\n* Fixes to rendering of list items: The rendering of HTML list items in the web chat widget has been updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.1.0 \n\nRelease date: 8 April 2021\n\n\n\n* Home screen now generally available: Ease your customers into the conversation by adding a home screen to your web chat window.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

You can also use a WebView to embed the web chat in your mobile app.\n\nFor detailed reference information about the web chat API, see the web chat [developer documentation](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=).\n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website or a WebView in your mobile app, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source (for more information about the embed script, see [Embedding the web chat on your page](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-web-chat)). Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":0.7022538185,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Securing the web chat \n\nUnderstand what you need to do to secure your web chat integration.\n\nConfigure the web chat to authenticate users and send private data from your embedded web chat.\n\nAll messages that are sent from the web chat are encrypted. When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple. Its simplicity also means it can be misused. That's why it's important to verify that the messages sent to your assistant are coming from authorized users only.\n\nBefore you enable security, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Create a RS256 private\/public key pair.\n\nYou can use a tool such as the OpenSSL command line or PuTTYgen.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16368-14455-16070","score":0.6648876667,"text":"\nDepending on whether you have enabled security for the web chat, you can use either the [updateUserID](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodsupdateuserid) instance method or the [updateIdentityToken](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodsupdateidentity) method to specify user identity information.\n\nFor more information about how user identity information is specified and how it is used, see [Managing user identity information](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-userid).\n\n\n\n\n\n Security and administration \n\nSecuring the web chat\n: To secure the web chat, you can use JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate users and encrypt private data.

A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02855-1612-3501","score":0.6325907111,"text":"\nSets the color of interactive elements, including:\n\n\n\n* Chat launcher button that is embedded in your web page\n* Send button associated with the input text field\n* Input text field border when in focus\n* Marker that shows the start of the assistant\u2019s response\n* Border of a button after it is clicked\n* Border of the drop-down list field as the user chooses an option\n* Typing indicator that is shown to repesent a pause response\n\n\n\n* Assistant image: This image is displayed in the web chat header along with the assistant name to represent your assistant or organization.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03196-30333-32476","score":0.6951589584,"text":"\nIn the Message before link to web chat field, edit the introductory message to display to the user (in the originating channel) before the link that initiates the transfer.

The user must then click the link to initiate the transfer.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred from one channel to another, the session history and context are preserved, so the destination channel can continue the conversation from where it left off. Note that the message output that contains the Channel transfer response is processed first by the channel that initiates the transfer, and then by the target channel. If the output contains multiple responses (perhaps using different response types), these will be processed by both channels (before and after the transfer). If you want to target individual responses to specific channels, you can do so by editing the response using the JSON editor.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07175-1564-2340","score":0.6781065464,"text":"\nFor more about training requirements and options, see [Improving result relevance with the tooling](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-tooling).\n\n\n\n\n\n Query overview \n\nThe Query overview section displays:\n\n\n\n* The total number of queries made by users\n* The percentage of queries with one or more results clicked\n* The percentage of queries with no results clicked\n* The percentage of queries with no results returned\n* A graph that displays these results over time, so that you can track how adding more data and relevancy training are improving performance\n\n\n\nThese results are gathered using the Events and Feedback API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00623-7-1781","score":0.7998543978,"text":"\nWorking with IBM Cloudant Query \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query is a declarative JSON querying syntax for IBM Cloudant databases.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-39512-41555","score":0.7865164876,"text":"\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century. The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Indexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Indexing video \n\nLearn how indexing can speed up your query process.\n\n\n\n* Indexing video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 11 - Indexing.\n\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00472-15523-16659","score":0.7853004932,"text":"\nquery: ':',\nincludeDocs: true,\nlimit: 1\n}).then(response => {\nconsole.log(response.result);\n});\n\nfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1\n\nservice = CloudantV1.new_instance()\n\nresponse = service.post_search(\ndb='<db-name>',\npartition_key='<partition-key>',\nddoc='<ddoc>',\nindex='<index-name>',\nquery=':',\ninclude_docs=True,\nlimit=1\n).get_result()\n\nprint(response)\n\npostPartitionSearchOptions := service.NewPostPartitionSearchOptions(\n\"<db-name>\",\n\"<partition-key>\",\n\"<ddoc>\",\n\"<index-name>\",\n\":\",\n)\npostPartitionSearchOptions.SetIncludeDocs(true)\npostPartitionSearchOptions.SetLimit(1)\n\nsearchResult, _, err := service.PostPartitionSearch(postPartitionSearchOptions)\nif err != nil {\npanic(err)\n}\n\nb, _ := json.MarshalIndent(searchResult, \"\", \" \")\nfmt.Println(string(b))\n\nThe previous Go example requires the following import block:\n\nimport (\n\"encoding\/json\"\n\"fmt\"\n\"github.com\/IBM\/cloudant-go-sdk\/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to query a global index:\n\nGET \/$DATABASE\/_design\/$DDOC\/_search\/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1 HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Type: application\/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00472-1437-3360","score":0.7807187438,"text":"\nYou can query the API by using one of the following methods: URI, IBM Cloudant Dashboard, curl, or a browser plug-in, such as Postman or RESTClient.\n\nSee the following example design document that defines a search index:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"_design\/search_example\",\n\"indexes\": {\n\"animals\": {\n\"index\": \"function(doc){ ... }\"\n}\n}\n}\n\n\n\n Search index partitioning type \n\nA search index inherits the partitioning type from the options.partitioned field of the design document that contains it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Index functions \n\nIf you attempt to index by using a data field that doesn't exist, it fails.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

They provide a key feedback loop because a human annotator can capture things she learned while annotating a few documents, then as she or someone else annotates a few more documents, new tips and gotchas can be added to the guideline, and so on.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-ml"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16454-13234-15485","score":0.6870413423,"text":"\nAs you get started, define 10 to 40 entity types and relation types. Stay to the lower end of the range if the human annotators who will be working on the workspace are not highly specialized in the field. Do not define more than 50.\n\nPlan to spend a good amount of time defining the type system before your team begins any human annotation tasks. When the team does start to annotate documents, begin with a small set, perhaps no more than 50. Annotate only mentions initially, examine the results, and refine your annotation guidelines and the type system as needed. When you're satisfied with the results of mention annotation, move on to annotate relations and coreferences.\n\nWhile fundamental work is underway to define a set of entity types and mention-annotation guidelines, avoid putting a lot of effort into annotating relation mentions. Mention changes will undo relation annotation work. Do take some time to define a set of relation types and their allowable entity type pairs so that relation type needs are taken into consideration before the entity type inventory is finalized.\n\nExpect the type system to evolve with the experience of people trying to annotate to it. If you revise the type system after you create human annotation tasks, you must decide whether to apply the changes to each task. If you apply the changes, human annotators will have to revisit the documents that they annotated previously.\n\nWhen you test the model, you can review statistics that show how frequently the entity types and relation types occur in your sample documents. Be sure to review these statistics. To ensure that your application receives enough context to accurately annotate large collections of documents, your test data must include a large sampling of the most important entity types and relation types.\n\n> Important: After you train your first model, you will likely need to make modifications based on the performance statistics. However, to create a reliable statistical model for machine annotation, you want the type system to be as close to final as possible before you begin large-scale annotation tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n When to define roles \n\nUsing roles enables you to define more precise entity types.\n\nEvery entity that you add has a role.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-typesystem"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16507-3099-4772","score":0.6835885644,"text":"\nIt can incorporate some of the function of the dictionary pre-annotator if you enable it, by identifying class types for dictionary terms that it finds in the documents also.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can upload already-annotated documents, and use them to start training the machine learning model.

You can also add more metrics by creating custom metrics and adding integrations.\n\n\n\n Metrics and labels \n\nA metric is a quantitative measure that has one or more labels to define its characteristics.\n\nUse metrics to analyze statistically data that has numerical values.\n\nA metric is represented by time series. A time-series is a unique combination of a metric name and label key-value pairs. For example: website_failedRequest |region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'. A data-point is the value generated for a time-series at a given point in time.\n\nLabels are classified as infrastructure labels and metric descriptor labels. Each metric has a set of pre-defined labels. For custom metrics, you can configure more labels.\n\nYou can use labels to identify and differentiate characteristics of a metric, for example,\n\n\n\n* You can group infrastructure objects into logical hierarchies.\n* You can filter out data.\n* You can split aggregated data into segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Collecting default metrics by using the Monitoring agent \n\nWhen you configure a Monitoring agent, data for default metrics is automatically collected. These metrics include metadata that you can use to label, segment, and display metrics when you monitor them. You do not need additional instrumentation or configuration in your hosts to obtain metrics that are collected automatically by the agent to gain insight into what is happening in them.\n\nTo monitor your infrastructure, network, and applications with the IBM Cloud\u00ae Monitoring service, you can deploy Monitoring agents on supported hosts. The host determines the agent type that you can deploy. The agent type determines the metrics that are collected automatically for that host.\n\nTo start collecting default metrics, you must configure a Monitoring agent per environment that you want to monitor.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-collect-metrics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09801-5098-6808","score":0.5991116166,"text":"\nThe metric ipmi_sel_free_space_bytes reports the number of free bytes for new ystem event log entries.\n* IPMI sensor data\n\nThe IPMI exporter collects 2 metrics per sensor type: state and value.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift overview \n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform is a platform that is designed to orchestrate containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS.

To help protect your apps from zone failures, you can add zones to your cluster.\n\nWhen you create a cluster, the worker nodes are provisioned in a worker pool. After cluster creation, you can add more worker nodes to a pool by resizing it or by adding more worker pools. By default, the worker pool exists in one zone.

The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed.

Layer-7 attacks are challenging, because the traffic can be difficult to identify as malicious.\n\n\n\n\n\n Protocol attacks \n\nProtocol attacks utilize weaknesses in Layer 3 and Layer 4 of the ISO protocol stack to render the target inaccessible.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14311-3835-5367","score":0.6102133989,"text":"\n[Layer 2 bridge setup with a new bridge edge cluster](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/5bdb37c0149145723c5437e8176651928565e722\/vmwaresolutions\/images\/arch-pattern-l2-bridge-edge.svg)\n\nFigure 3.

In this case, you might disable the destination until its security is set up.\n* You do not want the service to be available to users because you are making some updates to the service. In this case, you might temporarily disable the necessary gateways and wait for the service to be updated.\n* You have set up all your gateways and destinations on the front end, but your backend is still building. In this case, you would disable your gateways or destinations until the backend build is complete.\n\n\n\nFor more information on disabling a gateway or a destination, see [how to manage your Secure Gateway service instance](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/SecureGateway?topic=SecureGateway-manage-sg-service).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the recommended approach to creation automation across multiple spaces? \n\nFor example, your environment has one org and three spaces.

If you can create multiple gateways, are there any considerations for reusing a Node.js application to create a gateway and destination in each space?\n\nThe approach is as follows:\n\n\n\n* You can create a single Secure Gateway instance for all three spaces.

PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture.

SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate\/show consistency with the organization\u2019s enterprise architecture and information security architecture.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-pl-8"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13878-17352-18831","score":0.5920945406,"text":"\n* Tutorial: [Apply end to end security to a cloud application](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-cloud-e2e-security)\n* Tutorial: [Best practices for organizing users, teams, applications](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-users-teams-applications)\n* Blog: [Cloud App Security: What Makes a Secure App?](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/cloud-app-security)\n* Blog: [Onboarding Cloud Projects: Security and Resource Considerations](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/onboarding-cloud-projects-security-and-resource-considerations)\n* Blog: [Use Your FIDO2 Key for 2FA on IBM Cloud Apps](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/use-your-fido2-key-for-2fa-on-ibm-cloud-apps)\n* Blog: [Going Passwordless on IBM Cloud Thanks to FIDO2](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/going-passwordless-on-ibm-cloud-thanks-to-fido2)\n* Blog: [IBM Cloud Security Hands-On: Share Your Chatbot Project](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/share-your-chatbot-project)\n* Blog: [Increase Information Security for Db2 on IBM Cloud](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/increase-information-security-for-db2-on-ibm-cloud)\n* IBM Architecture Center: [Security to safeguard and monitor your cloud apps](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture\/architectures\/securityArchitecture)\n* [IBM Cloud platform service CLIs and APIs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-platform-svc-cli-api)\n* [IBM Cloud Compliance Programs](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/compliance)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-extended-app-security"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02839-3583-5403","score":0.6773864031,"text":"\nIf your skill will support a language with right-to-left directional text, such as Hebrew, configure the bidirectional capabilities.\n\nClick the options icon from the skill tile ![Skill options icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/kebab.png), and then select Language preferences.

Some of these views are designated as output views, while others are non-output views. Non-output views can include some views that are imported into or exported from a module. It is important to note that output views and exported views are orthogonal. For example, a view that is exported does not qualify as a view that is output. In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module.

By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical.

The best way to flip a pancake is to stick a spatula under it, lift it at least 4 inches in the air, and quickly rotate the spatula 180 degrees.\n\n\n\n* Many how or why questions are only fully answered by much longer spans of text.

Query analysis transforms the user's original query in ways that improve the chances of finding the best search results. For example, it lemmatizing words, removes stop words, and adds query expansions. The search is performed and the resulting documents and passages are returned.\n\nAnswer finding is applied to the returned passages. Up to 60 passages are sent to the answer-finding service. How these 60 passages are chosen differs based on the passages.per_document parameter value.\n\n\n\n* If passages.per_document is false, the top 60 passages from all of the documents that are returned by search are chosen based on their passage scores only.\n* If passages.per_document is true, the returned documents are ranked first, and then the top 60 passages from these top documents are chosen.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03218-31027-32769","score":0.6255592108,"text":"\nIf you do not take action, the same text response is displayed a second time to let users know they have returned to the node they digressed away from.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07321-0-2419","score":0.6784133911,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Securing your data in Direct Link \n\nDirect Link does not store any customer data.

The DEK itself is never stored, but instead is wrapped by a second key known as the key encryption key (KEK) to create a wrapped DEK.\n\nTo decrypt data, the wrapped DEK must first be unwrapped to get the DEK. This process is possible only by accessing the KEK, which in this case is your root key stored in either [Key Protect](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about) or [Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview).\n\nYou own the KEK, which you create as a root key in the Hyper Protect Crypto Services or Key Protect service.

However, customer-managed keys are not supported for instance storage. For sensitive data, it is strongly recommended that users utilize software-based file system encryption such as LUKS for Linux\u00ae or BitLocker for Windows\u00ae. This technology allows end users to encrypt entirely within the instance, and can provide additional protection for sensitive data in-transit between the instances and the physical drive media. Some operating systems also provide FIPS certified encryption algorithms that may also be used.

This could be from the sharing of a machine (i.e., the sharing of applications by many users who are running on the same computer) to just sharing the data center and parts of the infrastructure. In the following, you learn how you can isolate runtime environments, network traffic and stored data to increase application security.\n\n\n\n Use dedicated resources and virtual private clouds \n\nTo isolate application runtime environments and related services, you can provision dedicated machines and enterprise-level service plans. Typically, entry-level, lower-priced plans run on shared infrastructure in a multi-tenant mode. The more advanced plans utilize dedicated environments and provide greater physical separation of data.

One example is when applications and compute environments have to live on the same corporate network. Another scenario is that security logs are collected in central storage. In a microservice architecture, it requires us to configure services to access and use external resources. In turn, the shared resources must authorize access, and the network between them is configured to support such collaboration, but not more.\n\nSome typical use cases of resource sharing are:\n\n\n\n* Central management of security-related infrastructure. Monitor security from a dedicated account, and aggregate security logs in a single place. Manage all encryption keys in central key management systems (KMS).\n* Coordination of network addresses and subnets. Applications and compute environments need to fit into the same network and require sharing of address ranges and domain names.\n* Central management of resources for disaster recovery, including backup services like [IBM Cloud Backup for Classic](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Backup?topic=Backup-getting-started). Applications and their services may be designed for high availability, but additional centrally organized resources might be available to fall back to in the worst case. This includes holding multiple resource copies available worldwide, e.g., stored in [replicated Object Storage buckets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-replication-overview).\n* Control costs by sharing more expensive services where possible. Not every development project needs to have all services deployed as dedicated instances. Often, it is enough to share service instances - within accounts or across. Even for production environments, service instances might be shared depending on their cost\/value factor and technical feasibility.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-resource-sharing"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14905-7-2029","score":0.7764899731,"text":"\nAbout networking \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network that is linked to your customer account. It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency.

A VPC is a public cloud offering that an enterprise uses to establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared [public cloud](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/public) infrastructure. A VPC gives an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\n\nImagine that a cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure is a residential apartment building with multiple families living inside. Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium. No one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission.\n\nA VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic\/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to quickly provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance.

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nIBM Cloud virtual or IBM Cloud bare metal server presented in your VPC is attached to subnets. Subnets within the VPC offer private connectivity, thus your servers can communicate within and between the subnets by using an implicit router.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region. A region is also often referred to a multizone region or MZR.\n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center, which hosts the compute, network, storage resources, and the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other, so to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the range of addresses in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vpc-ryo-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14759-2917-4957","score":0.7498545647,"text":"\nFor day two of operation, it is your responsibility to monitor and manage the vCenter and NSX-T, including backups, patching, configuration, and monitoring of the VMware software and the underlying vSphere hypervisor.\n\n\n\n\n\n Key benefits \n\nThe architecture provides fundamental building blocks, which include VMware vSphere, vCenter Server, VMware NSX-T, and shared storage options, such as VMware vSAN or IBM Cloud VPC file share.

If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

See the [Compound questions](https:\/\/sodoherty.ai\/2017\/02\/06\/compound-questions\/) entry from Simon O'Doherty's blog for strategies you can try. (Simon is a developer on the Watson Assistant team.)\n* Dealing with ambiguous intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish that is ambiguous enough that your assistant finds two or more nodes with intents that could potentially address it. How does the dialog know which dialog branch to follow? If you enable disambiguation, it can show users their options and ask the user to pick the correct one. See [Disambiguation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity. But, using @appliance:(air conditioner) gets expanded to entity['appliance'].contains('air conditioner'), which matches whenever there is at least one @appliance entity of value 'air conditioner' detected in the user input.\n* Hiding data from the log: You can prevent information from being stored in Watson logs by storing it in a context variable and nesting the context variable within the $private section of the message context. For example: $private.my_info. Storing data in the private object hides it from the logs only. The information is still stored in the underlying JSON object.

Doing so helps to establish a relationship between the intent and entities. It is a weak relationship, but it does inform the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotated mentions \n\nAs you define entities, you can annotate mentions of the entity directly from your existing intent user examples. A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value. And when you add the mention to an existing entity value, it is also added to that entity value as new synonym. Intent classification does use these types of dictionary references in intent user examples to establish a weak reference between an intent and an entity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

And after that, a channel, to complete the infrastructure of our network.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll be using recommended values for the various fields in the UI. These are the same values you\u2019ll find in the docs, which are cataloged in tables for the various tasks. These values are not mandatory, but if you\u2019re using the console for the first time, we do recommended them. In cases where you have to reenter a value, for example an enroll ID and secret, which are not stored in the console, you will be able to refer to the tables in the documentation to remember what you entered. If you do choose different values, make sure to write them down somewhere.\n\nAlright, so let\u2019s get started creating that peer. If you're unfamiliar with Hyperledger Fabric, which the IBM Blockchain Platform is based on, you might not realize you have to create a Certificate Authority before you create a peer. This is because before we can create a peer, we have to create some identities. These identities allow a network entity, whether it\u2019s an admin or a node, to sign its actions using a certificate. Those certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, also known as a CA. Therefore, our first step in creating a peer is to create a CA and use it to register identities for the peer admin and for the peer itself.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00487-7-1462","score":0.615301609,"text":"\nCreating a document \n\nThe steps that are shown here demonstrate how to create a document.\n\n\n\n1.

If you've watched our videos on creating a peer and an ordering service, you should have a deployment that looks similar to this one, with one peer org, two CAs and an ordering service.\n\nAs with our previous videos, the steps we'll be going through today are from our Build a network tutorial in the IBM Blockchain Platform documentation. This tutorial will complete the structure you see here, with Org1, which we created in our first video, creating a channel run on our ordering service, which we created in our second video.\n\nIf you don't know what channels are, they're the place where transactions involving assets happen in the IBM Blockchain Platform. And because channels can be created with a subset of the members of a network, channels are also a powerful tool to enable privacy. Only the members of a channel will know about that channel and have access to its ledger, enabling the related business partners who form networks a space to execute deals that only they know about. Whatever the reason, the process for creating a channel is the same.\n\nSince we\u2019re creating a channel, you might be tempted to click over to the channels tab. But there's actually a step we need to do first, which is to add org1 to the consortium. Now what is the consortium? A consortium is the list of organizations that are allowed to create channels on a particular ordering service. Once an organization is added to this list, which is maintained by the admins of the ordering service, an organization will be able to create a channel. To do that, we must click into the Ordering Service and click Add Organization under the Consortium members header. Then we must select the org1msp, as this is our peer organization. Then click submit. Easy as that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11893-130441-131891","score":0.6050632,"text":"\n* [Optional: Creating the IBM Cloud Object Storage service instance](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remotesat-storage-odf-remote-cos)\n\n\n\n* [Creating and assigning a configuration in the console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remoteodf-remote-config-create-console)\n* [Creating a configuration in the CLI](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remoteodf-remote-config-create-cli)\n* [Creating a configuration in the API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remoteodf-remote-config-create-api)\n* [Creating a storage assignment in the console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remotestorage-odf-remote-include-assignment-create-console)\n* [Creating an assignment in the CLI](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remotestorage-odf-remote-include-assignment-create-cli)\n* [Creating a storage assignment in the API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remotestorage-odf-remote-include-assignment-create-api)\n\n\n\n* [Optional: Adding additional worker nodes to your ODF configuration](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remoteadd-worker-nodes-odf-remote)\n\n\n\n* [Deploying an app that uses OpenShift Data Foundation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-storage-odf-remotesat-storage-odf-remote-deploy)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-sitemap&interface=cli"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09099-1674-3393","score":0.604318738,"text":"\nBefore you create a key ring for your Key Protect instance, keep in mind the following considerations:\n\n\n\n* Every Key Protect instance comes with a default key ring.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03218-11740-13217","score":0.7609689236,"text":"\n<-- <\/ul> --><-- <\/section \"id=\"section-dialog-runtime-disambig-choose-nodes\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-dialog-runtime-disambig-disable\" \"> --> Hiding nodes from disambiguation altogether You can prevent every node in a dialog or an individual dialog node from being included in the disambiguation list.<-- <ul> --> * To disable disambiguation entirely:\n<-- <ul> -->\n\n* From the Skills menu, click Options.\n* On the Disambiguation page, set the switch to Off.\n\n<-- <\/ul> -->\n\n* To prevent a single dialog node from being included in the disambiguation list:\n<-- <ul> -->\n\n* From the Skills menu, click Dialog.

When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application.

For example, you might be creating an application that gains insights from medical records. To build the type system, you start looking at patient records to see what kinds of information must be captured. The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system. And in making the decision to make this omission, recognize that this means that sections of your patient record documents will be left unannotated. That is alright and even expected.\n\nMentions annotate a span of text; they do not replace the text. A type system is not an ontology for a domain. Expect to have general entity types such as MEDICATION_NAME instead of having an entity type for each medicine type. The document text will continue to contain the specific medicine name. It will just be enhanced with an annotation that identifies its type, which makes the information easier to find and extract programmatically.\n\nAs you get started, define 10 to 40 entity types and relation types.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

Similar to other use cases, all considerations for scalability, and other Qualities of Services apply.\n\nSee the following example that includes a discussion of [using Serverless as an API backend](https:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/serverless.htmlACoupleOfExamples).\n\n\n\n\n\n Mobile back end \n\nMany mobile applications require server-side logic. However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills. Since mobile applications often have unpredictable load patterns, you want to use a Cloud Functions solution like IBM Cloud\u00ae. This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10852-45155-46272","score":0.6953932047,"text":"\n* [Configuring the mobile SDK](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkconfigure-mobile-sdk)\n\n\n\n* [Support for qualified names with mobile SDK](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkqualified-names-mobile-sdk)\n* [Invoking actions with mobile SDK from WhiskButton](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkinvoke-mobile-sdk-actions-whiskbutton)\n\n\n\n\n\n[Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstoragepkg_obstorage)\n\n\n\n* [Packages for Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstorageobstorage_packages)\n* [Setting up the IBM Cloud Object Storage trigger](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstoragepkg_obstorage_ev)\n\n\n\n* [Prerequisites for working with the IBM Cloud Object Storage trigger](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstoragecos_changes_pre)\n* [1.

For example, the SDK should ensure all required parameters have been supplied before invoking the API.\n\nHowever, validation of specific enum values SHOULD NOT be performed in the SDK, since this would preclude the SDK from being used with a later version of the service that supports new enum values for a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n Default values \n\nThe SDK SHOULD NOT supply default values for any parameter not supplied by the caller, even if a default value is clearly specified in the API documentation. Rather, the assignment of the default should be delegated to the service, so that the service can alter the default value when appropriate without impacting the SDK.\n\n\n\n\n\n Serialization and deserialization \n\nThe SDK MUST silently ignore additional properties in response payloads, to allow the SDK to work with newer versions of the service.\n\nThe SDK SHOULD silently ignore additional properties in dictionary- or map-type parameters. This is to allow values that may have been returned from a newer version of the service to be supplied on subsequent method invocations.\n\n\n\n\n\n Retry \n\nThe SDK MAY provide an automated retry mechanism provided that the user can specify:\n\n\n\n* The maximum number of retry attempts, including zero.\n* The minimum and maximum time interval between retry attempts.\n* The HTTP status codes or error classes that should be retried.\n\n\n\nThe retry mechanism should respect a \"retry-after\" response header if one is returned from the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logging","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sdk-handbook?topic=sdk-handbook-content"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10863-6347-7636","score":0.6866043806,"text":"\nresult: true,\nparams: {}\n});\n})\n.catch((error) => {\nconsole.log('An error occurred!

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdk"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10864-5549-7975","score":0.7393391132,"text":"\nAdditionally, Cloud Functions actions can be connected to an API Management tool of choice. Similar to other use cases, all considerations for scalability, and other Qualities of Services apply.\n\nSee the following example that includes a discussion of [using Serverless as an API backend](https:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/serverless.htmlACoupleOfExamples).\n\n\n\n\n\n Mobile back end \n\nMany mobile applications require server-side logic. However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills. Since mobile applications often have unpredictable load patterns, you want to use a Cloud Functions solution like IBM Cloud\u00ae. This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10762-7-1641","score":0.7373028994,"text":"\nInstalling the CLI and plug-in \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Functions offers a powerful plug-in for the IBM Cloud CLI that allows complete management of the Cloud Functions system.

Then, test your knowledge and [!take a quiz](https:\/\/quizzes.12dekrh4l1b4.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud\/functions\/terms_quiz\/quiz.php)\n\n\n\nTable 1. Cloud Functions Terms\n\n Term Description \n\n Namespace [Namespaces](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-namespaces) contain Cloud Functions entities, such as actions and triggers, and belong to a resource group. You can let users access your Cloud Functions entities by granting them access to the namespace. \n Action An [action](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions) is a piece of code that performs one specific task. An action can be written in the language of your choice, such as small snippets of JavaScript or Swift code or custom binary code embedded in a Docker container. You provide your action to Cloud Functions either as source code or a Docker image. An action performs work when it is directly invoked by using the Cloud Functions API, CLI, or iOS SDK. An action can also automatically respond to events from IBM Cloud services and third-party services by using a trigger. \n Sequence A set of actions can be chained together into a [sequence](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-sequences) without having to write any code. A sequence is a chain of actions, invoked in order, where the output of one action is passed as input to the next action. By creating a sequence, you can combine existing actions together for quick and easy reuse. A sequence can then be invoked just like an action, through a REST API or automatically in response to events.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-about"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00509-1572-3493","score":0.6326842308,"text":"\nCORS is supported by all current versions of commonly used browsers.\n\nVersions of Microsoft\u2122 Internet Explorer before version 10 offer partial support for CORS.

The irrelevance detection model helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore. This enhanced model helps your skill recognize irrelevant inputs earlier in the development process.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of the new algorithm, read the [Why Zero-Effort Irrelevance is Relevant](https:\/\/medium.com\/ibm-watson\/enhanced-offtopic-90b2dadf0ef1) blog post.\n\nThe new algorithm is enabled automatically for any English-language skills that you import or create.\n\nTo test the new detection mechanism in the Try it out pane, submit one or more utterances that have absolutely nothing to do with your training data. The new mechanism helps your skill to correctly recognize that the test utterances do not map to any of the intents defined in your training data, and classifies them as being Irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n How irrelevance detection works \n\nThe algorithmic models that help your assistant understand what your users say are built from two key pieces of information:\n\n\n\n* Subjects you want the assistant to address. For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03027-8135-10108","score":0.5873667598,"text":"\nThis setting is not reflected in the Try it out panel.\n\n![Bidi options](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/bidi-options.png)\n3. Click the X to close the page. Your changes are saved automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Working with accented characters \n\nIn a conversational setting, users might or might not use accents while interacting with the Watson Assistant service. As such, both accented and non-accented versions of words might be treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever for some languages, like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity might implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word \"barri\u00f3\", which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb \"barrer\" (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word \"barrio\" (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" vs. \"una\". In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13333-1778-4047","score":0.5872488618,"text":"\nYou can set a threshold below which such events are ignored.\n\n\n\nBy default, speech activity detection is configured to provide optimal performance for the general case for each model. For specific cases, the default settings might not be optimal and can lead either to slow transcription or to word insertions and deletions. You are encouraged to experiment with different settings to determine which values work best for your audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity \n\nUse the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter to adjust the sensitivity of speech activity detection. Use the parameter to suppress word insertions from music, coughing, and other non-speech events. The service biases the audio it passes for speech recognition by evaluating chunks of the input audio against prior models of speech and non-speech activity.\n\nSpecify a float value between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.5, which provides a reasonable compromise for the level of sensitivity. A value of 0.0 suppresses all audio (no speech is transcribed). A value of 1.0 suppresses no audio (speech detection sensitivity is disabled). The values increase on a monotonic curve of sensitivity versus speech. Specifying one or two decimal places of precision (for example, 0.55) is typically more than sufficient.\n\nThis parameter can affect both the quality and the latency of speech recognition:\n\n\n\n* Lower values can decrease latency because less audio is potentially passed for speech recognition. However, a low setting might discard chunks of audio that contain actual speech, losing viable content from the transcript.\n* Higher values can increase latency because more audio is potentially passed for speech recognition. However, a high setting might pass chunks of audio that contain non-speech events, adding spurious content to the transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity example \n\nThe following example request specifies a value of 0.6 for the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter with the synchronous HTTP interface.

These security groups are automatically created and attached to cluster workers, load balancers, and cluster-related VPE gateways. You can modify or replace these security groups to meet your specific requirements, however, any modifications must be made according to these guidelines to avoid network connectivity disruptions.\n\n\n\n VPC security groups \n\nDefault behavior\n: Virtual Private Cloud security groups filter traffic at the hypervisor level. Security group rules are not applied in a particular order. However, requests to your worker nodes are only permitted if the request matches one of the rules that you specify. When you allow traffic in one direction by creating an inbound or outbound rule, responses are also permitted in the opposite direction. Security groups are additive, meaning that if your worker nodes are attached to more than one security group, all rules included in the security groups are applied to the worker nodes. Newer cluster versions might have more rules in the kube-clusterID security group than older cluster versions. Security group rules are added to improve the security of the service and do not break functionality.\n\nLimitations\n: Because the worker nodes of your VPC cluster exist in a service account and aren't listed in the VPC infrastructure dashboard, you can't create a security group and apply it to your worker node instances. You can only modify the existing security group.\n\nIf you modify the default VPC security groups, you must, at minimum, include the required [inbound](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group&interface=uimin-outbound-rules-sg-workers) and [outbound](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group&interface=uimin-inbound-rules-sg-workers) rules so that your cluster works properly.\n\n\n\n Security groups applied to cluster workers \n\nDo not modify the rules in thekube-<cluster-ID> security group as doing so might cause disruptions in network connectivity between the workers of the cluster and the control cluster.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12170-1498-3591","score":0.7245596051,"text":"\nVPC VPC provides you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud. \n zones You must have one VPC subnet for each zone in your cluster.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price.

You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.\n\nWhen compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:\n\n\n\n* Centralized account management: View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view. Your subscription credit is pooled and shared among accounts in the enterprise.\n* Top-down usage reporting: From your enterprise account, you can view usage of all accounts in your enterprise, which is organized by account group.\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch and learn \n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nYour IBM Cloud account is your home for collaboration in the cloud. As you scale up your workloads, you might find that you're managing multiple IBM Cloud accounts. For example, your company might have many teams, each with one or more of their own accounts for development, testing, and production environments. Or, you might isolate certain workloads in separate accounts to meet security or compliance guidelines. As the number of accounts grows, it can become more difficult to track resource usage and associated costs.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises offer a simpler way to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you can create a multi-tiered hierarchy of accounts by adding new or existing accounts and nesting them in account groups. How you structure your enterprise is up to you. For example, for a large organization, you might organize your accounts by geography, or by department. You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12561-4-2339","score":0.7767138481,"text":"\n* UI\n* CLI\n* API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Viewing usage in an enterprise \n\nYou can track resource and support costs from accounts in your IBM Cloud\u00ae enterprise by viewing their usage. The accounts and account groups that you can view usage for depend on your assigned access.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises enable you to centrally manage multiple IBM Cloud accounts. As an enterprise user, you can keep an eye on resource usage and the associated costs for any account in the enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) for more information.\n\n\n\n Required access for viewing enterprise usage \n\nIn an enterprise, access to usage information is controlled by the Enterprise service. To view usage information, users must be invited to the enterprise account and have the Usage Reports Viewer, Editor, or Administrator role on the Enterprise service. The Usage Reports Viewer role provides access only to viewing usage reports, while the Editor and Administrator roles enable additional enterprise management actions. In keeping with security best practices, assign the least amount of access that is needed for the user to complete their task. For more information, see [Enterprise actions and roles](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management).\n\nYou can give users granular access so that they can view usage for a certain account or account group. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team. You can scope the access so that each enterprise user can see only the information that is needed to fulfill their job role.\n\n\n\n* Your financial officer needs to view usage for the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department, but they don't need to create accounts or account groups. Assign them the Usage Reports Viewer role for the enterprise.\n* Each department lead needs to view usage for their department, and they also need to create and manage accounts and account groups for their teams. Assign each department lead the Editor role for their department's account group.\n* Each team lead needs to view their team's usage, but you want them to get department approval to add new accounts to their team.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-enterprise-usage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10906-3434-5590","score":0.7761253119,"text":"\nThis checklist is for administrators who are responsible for creating and setting up an account structure in IBM Cloud and enabling users within their company to create and manage cloud resources.

This means the users who are invited to the enterprise and the users who are invited to the accounts within the enterprise remain entirely separate. This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources. If you add a user to an enterprise account that contains a number of accounts, those users do not automatically have access to manage those accounts as far as user management, billing, and more. The enterprise account users also don't have access to any resources in other accounts within the enterprise.\n\nIf you want a user to manage the enterprise and have access to resources within child accounts, you must invite them to both accounts.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice.

When the employee leaves the company, the indefinite retention is converted to a finite value of three years from the current time, as defined by company policy.

This policy is enforced until a specified date or the removal of any legal holds.\n\n\n\n Why use Object Lock? \n\nObject Lock helps customers govern data preservation and retention requirements by enforcing data immutability for their backup, disaster recovery, and cyber resiliency workloads.\n\nObject Lock ensures that data cannot be deleted by anyone and there is no way to suspend retention on an object. Read the documentation carefully before locking objects with a retention period.\n\nWhen using Object Lock, it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with any regulations that you (your organization) may be subject to when it comes to preservation and storage of data for long term retention.\n\nWhen using Object Lock, you are responsible for ensuring that your IBM Cloud Account is kept in good standing per IBM Cloud policies and guidelines for as long as the data is subject to a retention period. Refer to IBM Cloud Service terms for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nThere are two ways use Object Lock to protect data: retention periods and legal holds.\n\n\n\n* A retention period defines a time frame during which an object is unable to be modified or deleted.\n* A legal hold also prevents an object from being altered, but only remains in place until it is explicitly lifted.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to make use of any combination of these parameters - an object version can have one, both, or neither.\n\n\n\n Retain Until Date (Retention Period) \n\nIf you need to protect an object version for a fixed amount of time, you need to specify a Retain Until Date which determines the period in which it cannot be altered. The object version can be be deleted after this date is passed (assuming there are no legal holds on the object version).\n\nThe retention period for new objects can be inherited from the default value set on the bucket, or it can be explicitly defined when writing the object by specifying a Retain Until Date.\n\nWhen you use bucket default settings, you don\u2019t specify a Retain Until Date. Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04831-50613-52356","score":0.7267092466,"text":"\nX-Clv-Request-Id: 3e8bdf1e-b611-4b83-a404-e7d3e58e60b0\nServer: Cleversafe\/3.14.9.53\nX-Clv-S3-Version: 2.5\nx-amz-request-id: 3e8bdf1e-b611-4b83-a404-e7d3e58e60b0\n\nThe server responds with 204 No Content.\n\n\n\n\n\n Add a retention policy on an existing bucket \n\nImmutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only, see [Integrated Services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage\/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-availabilityservice-availability) for details.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13316-7-2183","score":0.7199473381,"text":"\nUpgrading custom models \n\nTo improve the quality of speech recognition, the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service occasionally updates base previous- and next-generation models.

In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules.

Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic.

So again, where are we going to store the secret that's ultimately going to give us access to give us access to authentication and ultimately to the set of permissions that we need here? So that's again going to be the secrets manager service provided, and that service needs to talk to Cloud IAM again. Now that we've got this established, what type of credential do we have here? The credential that we have is called DB config. So let's think about the scenario we just walked through: this DB config allows this lending application a service to be able to have read access or be able to take a specific set of information from a given table within a database that has some IP data and some other highly sensitive information in it. So, in a scenario in which these DB configs are not stored properly or the service that they stored in is compromised, what we ultimately get is a pretty catastrophic scenario for the provider, because the provider of this service of this lending application then has to go and tell its customer that a bad actor was able to take advantage of access that it got wrongfully to its DB config. And, that DB config ultimately allowed that bad actor to steal their data and do whatever they wanted with it against that customer. What we can do to mitigate it again is stored in a safe location or bad actors do not have access and you have the level of data isolation that you're comfortable with as an enterprise. That's where we have secrets manager services.\n\nAgain, secrets manager services help to ensure the secure storage of secrets so that you don't have to worry about data breaches from last credentials or from other types of secrets.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules.

How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done. What it needs, in the form of the secret here, is what we call \"DB configs.\" Again, this DB config is going to allow it to have the correct communication with the service by saying, this is who I am and this is what I came here to accomplish.\n\nBut now that we have our user credentials in our DB configs as examples of secrets, we realize the vulnerability that can be created here if these credentials were to fall into the wrong hands. And this is why it's so important to establish a centralized place to manage all these things as we build out more applications and microservices. As we have more of these, the problem becomes more complex. If it falls into the wrong hands, how is protected? How do we block it from getting to that point? How was that data isolated?\n\nWhen we look at the damage that this can cause, we're looking in the millions of dollars, for example, for a data breach.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06063-53153-55320","score":0.6898742914,"text":"\nImage Vulnerability Scanner: By default, Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities.

Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry. Then, [install the open source Portieris project](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) admission controller to block container deployments from unsigned images.\n3. Regularly scan running containers:. Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Depending on the app, to add extra security, you can establish a job that takes down vulnerable containers after they are detected.\n\n\n\nYou can use the built-in container registry to automate the container image build process from your source code in an external source repository to your internal registry. However, images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the internal registry.

The same package can list multiple vulnerabilities, and in this case, a single package update can address multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability Advisor returns vulnerabilities only when a package fix is published by the distributor. Declared vulnerabilities that aren't fixed yet, or are not going to be fixed, are not reported by Vulnerability Advisor.

Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI\/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret.

But when it comes to enterprise workloads, use a private registry, such as the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users. For private registries, use registry secrets to ensure that the credentials are available to gain access to the private registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

You can update the Kubernetes API server only to the next version ahead of its current version (n+1). Additionally, your worker nodes can be up to two versions behind the master version (n-2).\n\nFor example, if your current Kubernetes API server version is 1.18 (n) and you want to update to 1.20, you must first update to 1.19 (n+1) and then to 1.20 (n+2). Next, you can update the worker nodes up to two version ahead, such as 1.18 to 1.20 (n+2).\n\nIf your cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version, follow the [version archive instructions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsk8s_version_archive).

Pods are removed and replaced frequently and dynamically. Instead, use a Kubernetes service, which represents a group of pods and provides a stable entry point through the service's virtual IP address, called its cluster IP. For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation on [Services](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/service\/discovering-services).\n\n\n\n How can I make sure that my services are connected to the correct deployments and ready to go? \n\nFor most services, add a selector to your service .yaml file so that it applies to pods that run your apps by that label. Many times when your app first starts up, you don't want it to process requests immediately. Add a readiness probe to your deployment so that traffic is only sent to a pod that is considered ready. For an example of a deployment with a service that uses labels and sets a readiness probe, check out this [NGINX YAML](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/IBM-Cloud\/kube-samples\/master\/deploy-apps-clusters\/nginx_preferredAntiAffinity.yaml).\n\nSometimes, you don't want the service to use a label. For example, you might have an external database or want to point the service to another service in a different namespace within the cluster. When this happens, you have to manually add an endpoints object and link it to the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n How can I expose my services on the Internet? \n\nYou can create three types of services for external networking: NodePort, LoadBalancer, and Ingress.\n\nYou have different options that depend on your cluster type.

A ClusterIP service provides an in-cluster IP address that is accessible by other pods and services inside the cluster only. No external IP address is created for the app. To access a pod behind a cluster service, other apps in the cluster can either use the in-cluster IP address of the service or send a request by using the name of the service. When a request reaches the service, the service forwards requests to the pods equally, independent of pods' in-cluster IP addresses and the worker node that they are deployed to. Note that if you don't specify a type in a service's YAML configuration file, the ClusterIP type is created by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n NodePort \n\nWhen you expose apps with a [NodePort](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-nodeport) service, a NodePort in the range of 30000 - 32767 and an internal cluster IP address is assigned to the service. To access the service from outside the cluster, you use the public or private IP address of any worker node and the NodePort in the format <IP_address>:<nodeport>. However, the public and private IP addresses of the worker node are not permanent. When a worker node is removed or re-created, a new public and a new private IP address are assigned to the worker node.\n\nNodePorts are ideal for testing public or private access or providing access for only a short amount of time. Note: Because worker nodes in VPC clusters don't have a public IP address, you can access an app through a NodePort only if you are connected to your private VPC network, such as through a VPN connection.\n\nZoom\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

The parameters let you tailor aspects of your request, such as whether the data is streamed or sent all at once, and the information that the service includes in its response.\n\nThe following sections introduce the speech recognition parameters and their functionality. Some parameters are available only for some speech recognition interfaces or for some languages and models. For information about all parameters and their interface and language support, see the [Parameter summary](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-summary).\n\n\n\n Audio transmission and timeouts \n\n\n\n* [Audio transmission](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-inputtransmission) describes how you can pass audio as a continuous stream of data chunks or as a one-shot delivery that passes all of the data at one time. With the WebSocket interface, audio data is always streamed to the service over the connection. With the HTTP interfaces, you can stream the audio or send it all at once.\n* [Timeouts](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-inputtimeouts) are used by the service to ensure an active flow of data during audio streaming. When you initiate a streaming session, the service enforces inactivity and session timeouts from which your application must recover gracefully. If a timeout lapses during a streaming session, the service closes the connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interim results and low latency \n\n\n\n* [Interim results](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-interiminterim-results) are intermediate hypotheses that the service returns as transcription progresses.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-features"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13779-3555-3945","score":0.6522787809,"text":"\nvar access_token = '{access_token}';\nvar wsURI = '{ws_url}\/v1\/synthesize'\n+ '?access_token=' + access_token\n+ '&customization_id={customization_id}'\n+ '&voice=en-US_AllisonV3Voice';\nvar websocket = new WebSocket(wsURI);\n\nfunction onOpen(evt) {\nvar message = {\ntext: '<ibm:prompt id=\"goodbye\"\/>',\naccept: 'audio\/ogg;codecs=opus'\n};\nwebsocket.send(JSON.stringify(message));\n}\n\n. . .\nShow more","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-tbe-use"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13455-24911-26512","score":0.6513341665,"text":"\n\"content-type\": \"audio\/l16;rate=22050\",\n\"interim_results\": true\n}\n<binary audio data>\n{\n\"action\": \"stop\"\n}\n* The service responds:\n\n{\"results\": [{\"alternatives\": {\"transcript\": \"name \"}],\n\"final\": false}], \"result_index\": 0}\n{\"results\": [{\"alternatives\": {\"transcript\": \"name may \"}],\n\"final\": false}], \"result_index\": 0}\n{\"results\": [{\"alternatives\": {\"transcript\": \"name may flour \"}],\n\"final\": false}], \"result_index\": 0}\n{\"results\": [{\"alternatives\": {\"transcript\": \"name the mayflower \",\n\"confidence\": 0.91}], \"final\": true}], \"result_index\": 0}\n{\"state\":\"listening\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WebSocket return codes \n\nThe service can send the following return codes to the client over the WebSocket connection:\n\n\n\n* 1000 indicates normal closure of the connection, meaning that the purpose for which the connection was established has been fulfilled.\n* 1002 indicates that the service is closing the connection due to a protocol error.\n* 1006 indicates that the connection closed abnormally.\n* 1009 indicates that the frame size exceeded the 4 MB limit.\n* 1011 indicates that the service is terminating the connection because it encountered an unexpected condition that prevents it from fulfilling the request.\n\n\n\nIf the socket closes with an error, the client receives an informative message of the form {\"error\":\"{message}\"} before the socket closes. Use the onerror event handler to respond appropriately.

The WebSocket interface\n\n\n\n* Provides a single-socket, full-duplex communication channel. The interface lets the client send multiple requests to the service and receive results over a single connection in an asynchronous fashion.\n* Provides a much simpler and more powerful programming experience. The service sends event-driven responses to the client's messages, eliminating the need for the client to poll the server.\n* Allows you to establish and use a single authenticated connection indefinitely. The HTTP interfaces require you to authenticate each call to the service.\n* Reduces latency. Recognition results arrive faster because the service sends them directly to the client. The HTTP interface requires four distinct requests and connections to achieve the same results.\n* Reduces network utilization. The WebSocket protocol is lightweight. It requires only a single connection to perform live-speech recognition.\n* Enables audio to be streamed directly from browsers (HTML5 WebSocket clients) to the service.\n* Returns results as soon as they are available when you use a next-generation model or request interim results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using speech recognition parameters \n\nThe service's speech recognition interfaces share largely common parameters for transcribing speech to text.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-features"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13455-7-1568","score":0.6419353485,"text":"\nThe WebSocket interface \n\nThe WebSocket interface of the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service is the most natural way for a client to interact with the service.

A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

Follow the instructions on the Live agent tab in the web chat configuration for setting up those systems.

If User-to-User is specified in the transfer_headers list, the session history key is sent in the X-Watson-Assistant-Session-History-Key header.\n\nThe value of the SIP header is limited to 1024 bytes.\n\nHow this data is presented in the SIP REFER message also depends on the value of transfer_headers_send_method(as defined in [Generic Service Desk SIP Parameters](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsgeneric-service-desk-sip-parameters)).\n\nThe following example shows the data included as headers:\n\nREFER sip:b@atlanta.example.com SIP\/2.0\nVia: SIP\/2.0\/UDP agenta.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK2293940223\nTo: <sip:b@atlanta.example.com>\nFrom: <sip:a@atlanta.example.com>;tag=193402342\nCall-ID: 898234234@agenta.atlanta.example.com\nCSeq: 23 REFER\nMax-Forwards: 7\nRefer-To: sip:user@domain.com","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16250-5445-7809","score":0.6582181454,"text":"\nTo support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant.

An example is the [3-way merge](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Merge_%28version_control%29Three-way_merge).\n\n\n\nFor a practical example of how to implement these changes, see [this project with sample code](https:\/\/github.com\/glynnbird\/deconflict).\n\n\n\n\n\n Upload the new revision \n\nSee the following final revisions after you resolve and merge changes from the previous conflicting revisions:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"74b2be56045bed0c8c9d24b939000dbe\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-conflicts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05713-392150-393569","score":0.6080271006,"text":"\n* [Change log for 1.7.3, released 06 October 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog173)\n* [Change log for 1.7.2, released 23 September 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog172)\n* [Change log for 1.7.1, released 14 September 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog171)\n* [Change log for 1.7.0, released 02 September 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog170)\n\n\n\n* [Version 1.6 (unsupported)](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelogv16)\n\n\n\n* [Differences between version 1.6 of managed and community Istio](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelogdiff-managed-comm-16)\n* [Change log for 1.6.14, released 3 December 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog1614)\n* [Change log for 1.6.13, released 5 November 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog1613)\n* [Change log for 1.6.12, released 22 October 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog1612)\n* [Change log for 1.6.11, released 06 October 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog1611)\n* [Change log for 1.6.9, released 14 September 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog169)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05713-393186-394583","score":0.6073344946,"text":"\n* [Change log for 1.6.12, released 22 October 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog1612)\n* [Change log for 1.6.11, released 06 October 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog1611)\n* [Change log for 1.6.9, released 14 September 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog169)\n* [Change log for 1.6.8, released 12 August 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog168)\n* [Change log for 1.6.7, released 04 August 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog167)\n* [Change log for 1.6.5, released 17 July 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog165)\n* [Change log for 1.6, released 08 July 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog16)\n\n\n\n* [Version 1.5 (unsupported)](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelogv15)\n\n\n\n* [Differences between version 1.5 of managed and community Istio](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelogdiff-managed-comm)\n* [Change log for 1.5.10, released 1 September 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog1510)\n* [Change log for 1.5.9, released 12 August 2020](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-istio-changelog159)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02601-1302-3544","score":0.6035421491,"text":"\nDevelopment and Production catalogs behave differently:\n\n\n\n* Development catalog:\n\nIf you select the development mode, staging and publishing actions are forced. If you republish a Product, it is overwritten without warning. If conflicts are found, they are automatically resolved by the system. Unpublish actions happen automatically.\n\nNote: Approval boxes are not displayed for development Catalogs. You cannot enable the approval process for lifecycles.\n* Production catalog:\n\nYou will be prevented from publishing a Product to a Production Catalog if there is already a Product in the Catalog with the same name and version; you must create a new version of the Product for publication. If Spaces are enabled in a production Catalog, you cannot publish a Product with the same name and version to more than one Space in the Catalog.\n\nIf you create a new Product that contains one or more modified APIs, you must create new versions of those APIs for inclusion in the Product. If the Product contains a modified API and there is already a published API with the same name and version, your changes will not be published.\n\n\n\nb. If you want to enable automatic subscription for the Catalog, select Automatic subscription.\n\nEnabling automatic subscription makes testing your APIs easier because a test application is used. The test application includes a pre-supplied client ID and client secret. The test application is automatically subscribed to all of the Plans in the Catalog, so you don't have to specify a plan or application when testing.\n\nNote: Automatic subscription is available only for a development Catalog.\n\nc.

For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06004-15614-17542","score":0.6582825184,"text":"\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

Key Protect on Satellite connects to a user owned and managed hardware security module (HSM), which gives users full control of the encryption keys and its operations within the HSM FIPS boundary.\n\nIn this topic, references to \"Key Protect\" refer to the Key Protect on Satellite service.\n\nAs protecting data everywhere becomes increasingly critical for organizations transforming into hybrid Cloud IT, IBM Cloud is introducing the ability for Key Protect to support data encryption on the new Satellite environments. Key Protect on Satellite enables secure data services closer to where they are needed, with the additional security benefit of allowing customers to have separate and direct control of their \"root of trust\" with Bring Your Own Hardware Security Module (BYOHSM) capability.\n\nTo deploy Key Protect on Satellite, you must be added to the allowlist. [Contact IBM](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/contact\/us\/en\/) to learn more.\n\nBecause Key Protect on Satellite features both a Satellite location with services (such as Key Protect) managed by IBM Cloud and infrastructure controlled by the user (including two fully user-controlled HSMs), it is designed for users who either desire or require closer control over their infrastructure (and keys) than is available with a fully managed service offering deployed on IBM Cloud. This offering includes single tenant Key Protect on Satellite that connects to two user-controlled HSMs, in contrast to the multi-tenant fully managed Key Protect in IBM Cloud.\n\nThis level of control is designed for users who want to promote internal best practices or satisfy relevant legal requirements. Users can use the same key management service on IBM Cloud Key Protect, on-prem Key Protect on Satellite, and in future hybrid cloud environments, depending on the use case. This level of control is designed for businesses and industries where closer control over infrastructure satisfies business or regulatory needs (for example, a banking consortium subject to data residency rules).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-satellite-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01494-54686-56173","score":0.6210877895,"text":"\n* [About Vulnerability Advisor](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexabout)\n\n\n\n* [Data protection](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexabout_data_protection)\n\n\n\n* [Types of vulnerabilities](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indextypes)\n\n\n\n* [Vulnerable packages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexpackages)\n* [Configuration issues - version 3 only](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexapp_configurations)\n\n\n\n* [Setting the Vulnerability Advisor version](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_set_version)\n* [Reviewing a vulnerability report](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_reviewing)\n\n\n\n* [Reviewing a vulnerability report by using the console - version 3 only](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_reviewing_gui)\n* [Reviewing a vulnerability report by using the CLI](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_registry_cli)\n\n\n\n* [Setting organizational exemption policies](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_managing_policy)\n\n\n\n* [Setting exemption policies by using the console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_managing_policy_gui)\n* [Setting exemption policies by using the CLI](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_managing_policy_cli)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting up Terraform for Container Registry","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07949-18458-20752","score":0.6208458543,"text":"\n[IBM Cloud\u00ae Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hyper-protect-dbaas-for-mongodb?topic=hyper-protect-dbaas-for-mongodb-overview) offers highly secure database environments that have technology-enforced protection and high availability.\n\nBuilt on IBM LinuxONE technology, Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB helps you to alleviate data security and compliance concerns with built-in encryption and tamper protection for data at rest and in flight.

Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI\/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10906-16826-18553","score":0.6199485064,"text":"\n<br><br> * Encrypt and protect your data<br><br><br> You can choose from various secrets management and data protection products that help you to protect your sensitive data and centralize your secrets.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret.

Cloud Functions serverless architecture reduces the constraint on the granularity of your microservices architecture.\n\nWhen not in use, Cloud Functions costs nothing. Your code runs only when a specific action occurs, such as an HTTP call, database state change, or other type of event that triggers the execution of your code. You get billed by millisecond of execution time rounded up to the nearest 100 MS, not per hour of VM utilization regardless of whether that VM was doing useful work. Because you pay only when events are consumed and not based on the number of environments, you can break down your app into 100, 1000, or even more microservices.\n\n\n\n\n\n Run actions in any region \n\nIn traditional architectures, code must be running in each region to be executed there and the infrastructure for that region must also be paid for.

You can increase the availability and resiliency of your code without the traditional cost restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Redundancy by design \n\nIn traditional architectures, apps must be redundant.

An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running. You can develop and deploy Spark SQL, data transformation, data science, or machine learning jobs using the Spark application API.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the advantages of IBM Analytics Engine serverless instances? \n\nWith IBM Analytics Engine serverless, compute and memory resources are allocated on demand when Spark workloads are deployed. When an application is not in running state, no computing resources are allocated to the IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the instance, billed on a per second basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark support Hadoop? \n\nNo, currently, the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark only supports Apache Spark.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change the instance home storage of a serverless instance? \n\nNo, you can't. After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries. Changing instance home would result in the loss of the Spark history data and custom libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is user management and access control managed in a serverless instance? \n\nUser management and access control of an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance and its APIs is done through IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM). You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges. See [Granting permissions to users](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I define the size of the cluster to run my Spark application? \n\nYou can specify the size of the cluster either at the time the instance is created or when submitting Spark applications.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-faqs-serverless"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.25,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.1510196182,"ndcg_cut_10":0.268535723}}

Given this common terminology, you can create dictionaries to help you categorize and filter the data.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00029-8568-9861","score":0.7460207343,"text":"\n\"spark.hive.metastore.client.auth.mode\":\"PLAIN\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.use.SSL\":\"true\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.stats.autogather\":\"false\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.client.plain.username\":\"<CHANGEME-CRN-DATA-ENGINE-INSTANCE>\",\n for spark 3.3\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"\/opt\/ibm\/jdk\/lib\/security\/cacerts\",\n for spark 3.1, spark 3.2\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"file:\/\/\/opt\/ibm\/jdk\/jre\/lib\/security\/cacerts\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars\":\"\/opt\/ibm\/connectors\/data-engine\/hms-client\/\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.version\":\"3.0\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\":\"file:\/\/\/tmp\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hadoop.metastore.catalog.default\":\"spark\"\n},\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"application\": \"cos:\/\/mybucket.ALIAS NAME\/select_query_data_engine.py\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n}\nShow more\n\nParameter values:\n\n\n\n* ALIAS NAME: specify the data engine endpoint for your region.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-3313-5682","score":0.6810652614,"text":"\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period.

The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

This page reflects only classic infrastructure charges. To view your official invoice and for any pricing inquiries, visit IBM Invoices. To sign up and view your invoices, you must provide your IBM customer number.

Review the following differences for billing based on your account type:\n\n\n\n*  Subscription: The billed interval is contractual and depends on a negotiated payment for usage credits.\n*  Pay-As-You-Go: An estimation of your charges is found on the [Usage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/usage) page.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01705-7074-9036","score":0.6641104221,"text":"\nAlso, with a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can order Advanced or Premium support plans to get extra help with your production workloads.

In addition, Subscription accounts provide discounts for platform services and support and more consistent billing through subscriptions. You can also [set up spending notifications](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending) to get notified when your account or a particular service reaches a specific spending threshold that you set.\n\nWhen you purchase a subscription, you commit to a minimum spending amount for a certain period of time and receive a discount on the overall cost. For example, if you commit to spend $1,000 a month for 6 months, you might get a 5% discount. For the duration of the subscription, you get $6,000 of usage but pay only $5,700 for it. The larger the subscription, the better the discount.\n\nLarge organizations and other users with large cloud workloads can benefit from the savings and predictable billing that are provided by subscriptions.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03765-2725-4571","score":0.6600033045,"text":"\n[Actions icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1\/icons\/action-menu-icon.svg) > Set as default.\n2.
