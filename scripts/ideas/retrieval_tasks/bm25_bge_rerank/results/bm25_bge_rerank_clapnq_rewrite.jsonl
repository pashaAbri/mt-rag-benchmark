McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 .

Collier added 0.5 % phenol to the vaccine to reduce the number of bacterial contaminants but the key stage was to add 5 % peptone to the liquid vaccine before it was dispensed into ampoules . This protected the virus during the freeze drying process . After drying the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen . Like other vaccines , once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1 -- 2 days at ambient temperatures . However , the dried vaccine was 100 % effective when reconstituted after 6 months storage at 37 \u00b0 C ( 99 \u00b0 F ) allowing it to be transported to , and stored in , remote tropical areas .

Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations .

Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel .

His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church in Boston , Massachusetts . His mother , who loved to spend time with her children , played games with Cummings and his sister , Elizabeth . From an early age , Cummings 's parents supported his creative gifts . Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child , and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood . He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce . Many of Cummings ' summers were spent on Silver Lake in Madison , New Hampshire , where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore .

Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football , it is much slower - paced than the more hectic rugby league , in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play . Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league ; defending players interfering with any other attacking player ( and vice versa ) will incur a penalty . Passing in the two sports also differs : while backward passing is common to both sports , in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal . Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield . To score a try or touchdown in rugby league , the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone , whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line . American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment , including helmets , gloves and padding around the body , whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league , usually amounting to light padding ( if any ) and soft head gear ( hard helmets being illegal ) .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color .

In 48 BC , Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers , which made his person sacrosanct , allowed him to veto the Roman Senate , and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council .

Thus , he could hold Censorial powers , while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks that the ordinary Censors were subject to , and he used these powers to fill the senate with his own partisans .

Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders .

'' Andrew Collins of Radio Times agreed , writing that Aniston `` seems trapped , perpetually playing variations of Rachel '' . According to TV Guide , Aniston is `` usually called upon to play a variation of her neurotic and adorable Friends character '' .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel . '' Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position . The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends . '' Ultimately , Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes , two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired , thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show , becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25 .", "title": "Rachel Green", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "826231264_30317-32490-0-2173", "score": 0.6836104393005371, "text": "Rachel Green\nWithin the first two seasons of Friends , the character became extremely popular among women .

Writing for TalkTalk , Dominic Wills agreed that while Rachel established herself as `` the general favourite ... No one had a bad word to say about Jennifer Aniston '' , with whose performance audiences instantly fell in love . Aniston 's performance has been consistently praised since her debut in the pilot , about which Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker wrote that the actress portrays Rachel with `` prickly intelligence '' . Writing for The Baltimore Sun , David Zurawik cited Aniston among the show 's `` very strong cast '' , while Variety 's Tony Scott agreed that `` All six of the principals ... appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills '' ; Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised the work of show 's female cast equally . TV Guide wrote that Aniston `` instantly charmed audiences with her perfect looks and endearingly flawed persona '' , while Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast referred to Aniston 's tenure on Friends as not `` a leading lady performance '' but instead `` the work of a brilliant character actress . '' The Guardian 's Ryan Gilbey highlighted Aniston as the cast member `` least reliant on goofball caricature '' , observing that `` Playing the only character with whom a sane viewer might reasonably identify also meant that she got the lion 's share of attention '' .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ?

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed .

Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other . That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers ' language : Juliet , for example , speaks of `` my only love sprung from my only hate '' and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo 's death .

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , an event he famously called `` a date which will live in infamy '' , Roosevelt obtained a declaration of war on Japan the next day , and a few days later , on Germany and Italy .

Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy , making the defeat of Germany a priority over that of Japan . He also initiated the development of the world 's first atomic bomb and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions .
