These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00513-7-2197", "score": 0.7076270580291748, "text": "\nDatabase overview \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae databases contain JSON objects.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time.

The Standard plan also charges for the amount of storage you use. Capacity is measured with the following metrics:\n\n\n\nTable 2. Capacity metrics\n\n Metric Description \n\n Reads per second The rate when simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its _id, or querying against a partitioned database that uses a partition key. \n Writes per second The rate when data is written to the database.

This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance. The Standard plan's smallest capacity has 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 20 GB of storage for USD$76.65 per month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-migrating-to-ibm-cloudant-on-ibm-cloud"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00576-7385-9302", "score": 0.6695342063903809, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly. Deleting an IBM Cloudant document leaves a tombstone document behind, so don't rely on deleting documents to recover disk space. Instead, you must rely on deleting whole databases.\n\nJSON doesn't offer a native way to store dates or timestamps.

Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Exceeding this limit causes a [413 error](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).\n\nIBM Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem) model for data. If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

However, a few hard and fast rules exist.\n\nOne rule is that every document must contain a unique identifier that is called _id, which is a string. Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant. The ID is a meaningless sequence of numbers and letters that are guaranteed to be unique.\n* A string that is defined by you (if you know something unique about your data).\n\n\n\nThe following examples show how to supply your own document _id:\n\nUsing it to store something that you know is unique that is, the email address of a user. Your registration mechanism can enforce a one-user-per-email address policy. Some users choose to encode the document type in the _id, for example, user:56, book:55. The last example shows with a 32-digit string (generated in your app) that is designed to sort in approximate date and time order. This method makes it easy to retrieve the latest documents from the database, without a secondary index.\n\nIBM Cloudant takes your document _ids and stores them in an index (like the contents page of book).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-449817-451754", "score": 0.6843547821044922, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Migrating from a Lite plan to a Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-migrating-from-a-lite-plan-to-a-standard-plan).\n* Can I back up my data before I migrate?\n\nThe IBM Cloudant team advises that you use the [couchbackup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-backup-and-recoveryibm-cloudant-backup-and-recovery) utility to export data to disk.

You can then import at another time.\n* To quickly make a backup, use the Web console, run a query, then download the results to a CSV file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change the email I use for reactivation? \n\nCreate a new Lite instance with the email you want to use going forward. If needed, first back up your data, delete your current Lite plan instance to create a new one, then load your data. You cannot change the email address associated with an existing Db2 Lite instance if you have only a Lite account with community support.\n\n\n\n\n\n I am having trouble with reactivation.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16295-7-1721", "score": 0.68269282579422, "text": "\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16383-0-2125", "score": 0.6719449758529663, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Controlling the web chat version \n\nThe web chat JavaScript code follows semantic versioning practices. Starting with web chat version 2.0.0, you can set the version of the web chat that you want to use as a configuration option.\n\nIf you don't specify a version, the latest version is used automatically (clientVersion: \"latest\"). When you apply the latest version, you benefit from the continuous improvements, feature additions, and bug fixes that are made to the web chat regularly.\n\nHowever, if you apply extensive customizations to your deployment, such as overriding the theme with your own custom theme, you might want to lock your deployment to a specific version. Locking on a version enables you to test new versions before you apply them to your live web chat.\n\nTo use a specific version (clientVersion: \"major.minor.patch\"), specify it as follows:\n\nThe following examples show what to specify when the current version is 2.3.1.\n\n\n\n*  If you want to stay on a major version, but get the latest minor and patch releases, specify clientVersion: \"2\".\n*  If you want to stay on a minor version, but get the latest patch releases, specify clientVersion: \"2.3\".\n*  If you want to lock on to a specific minor version and patch release, specify clientVersion: \"2.3.1\".\n\n\n\nTo test the updates in a version release of the web chat before you apply the version to your live web chat, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.  Lock the web chat that is running in your production environment to a specific version.\n2.  Embed your web chat deployment into a new page in a test environment, and then override the version lock setting. For example, specify clientVersion: \"latest\".\n3.  Test the web chat, and make adjustments to the configuration if necessary.\n4.  Update your production deployment to use the latest version and apply any other configuration changes that you determined to be necessary after testing.\n\n\n\nFor more information about features that were introduced in previous web chat versions, see the [Web chat release notes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-release-notes-chat).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-versions"}]}

Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03188-4819-6738", "score": 0.6772816181182861, "text": "\nFor more information about how to pass data, see [Passing sensitive data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt).\n\nTo access the payload data, you can reference the context.integrations.chat.private.user_payload object from the dialog node condition.\n\nYou must know the structure of the JSON object that is sent in the payload.\n\nFor example, if you passed the value \"mvp:true\" in the JSON payload, you can add a dialog flow that checks for this value to define a response that is meant for VIP customers only.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-110490-112399", "score": 0.6102972626686096, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configure the search](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-search-addskill-search-add-configure).\n\n\n\n\n\n 25 August 2020 \n\nGive the web chat integration a try!\n: You can now use the web chat integration with a Lite plan.

For example, you must keep up with browser support changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and design the layout and styling. The time you spend designing and maintaing a UI can be better spent building a quality assistant instead. When you use the web chat integration, you can rely on us to manage the user interface, so you can focus on designing conversational exchanges that address the unique business needs of your customers. Cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research is incorporated into the web chat to deliver an exceptional user experience.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy the web chat, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Global audience support", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16334-17373-19365", "score": 0.5927227735519409, "text": "\n* Home screen: The web chat home screen has been updated to have a more modern look. For more information about the home screen, see [Configuring the home screen](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-configweb-chat-configure-home-screen).\n* Agent events: New events are now fired by the web chat when interacting with a human agent using a service desk integration. If you are using a custom service desk integration based on the [starter kit](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-web-chat-service-desk-starter), you can use these events to create a pre-chat form before the agent escalation occurs, to create a post-chat form after the agent conversation ends, or to specify what happens if an agent isn\u2019t available (like create a ticket submission form). For more information, see [Agent events summary](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-eventssummary).\n* Markdown support: The web chat now fully supports common Markdown formatting in messages received from an assistant. You might need to review existing assistant output that contains strings that might be recognized as Markdown. (For example, a line of text that begins with a greater-than (>) character is interpreted as a block quote.)\n* Time zone: The time zone set in the context by the web chat no longer overrides any time zone set by the assistant.\n* Locale: Any locale configured for the web chat is now sent to the assistant as part of the context.\n* Window open events: The window:pre:open and window:open events now fire any time the chat window is opened, regardless of the reason. In previous releases, these events only fired if the window was opened by the customer clicking on the built-in launcher. Other methods of opening the chat window, such as session history or custom launchers, did not fire these events.\n\nThe event data passed to the listener has a new reason property that indicates the reason the window was opened.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-release-notes-chat"}]}

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

Starting with web chat version 2.0.0, you can set the version of the web chat that you want to use as a configuration option.\n\nIf you don't specify a version, the latest version is used automatically (clientVersion: \"latest\"). When you apply the latest version, you benefit from the continuous improvements, feature additions, and bug fixes that are made to the web chat regularly.\n\nHowever, if you apply extensive customizations to your deployment, such as overriding the theme with your own custom theme, you might want to lock your deployment to a specific version. Locking on a version enables you to test new versions before you apply them to your live web chat.\n\nTo use a specific version (clientVersion: \"major.minor.patch\"), specify it as follows:\n\nThe following examples show what to specify when the current version is 2.3.1.\n\n\n\n*  If you want to stay on a major version, but get the latest minor and patch releases, specify clientVersion: \"2\".\n*  If you want to stay on a minor version, but get the latest patch releases, specify clientVersion: \"2.3\".\n*  If you want to lock on to a specific minor version and patch release, specify clientVersion: \"2.3.1\".\n\n\n\nTo test the updates in a version release of the web chat before you apply the version to your live web chat, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.  Lock the web chat that is running in your production environment to a specific version.\n2.  Embed your web chat deployment into a new page in a test environment, and then override the version lock setting. For example, specify clientVersion: \"latest\".\n3.  Test the web chat, and make adjustments to the configuration if necessary.\n4.  Update your production deployment to use the latest version and apply any other configuration changes that you determined to be necessary after testing.\n\n\n\nFor more information about features that were introduced in previous web chat versions, see the [Web chat release notes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-release-notes-chat).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-versions"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16295-7-1721", "score": 0.658955454826355, "text": "\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04709-3574-5709", "score": 0.6436722278594971, "text": "\nGateway routing Use a virtual or physical network appliance (Virtual Router Appliance, Vyatta, Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA) Traffic routing is handled by public gateway and floating IP services \n Network address translation (NAT) Use a virtual or physical network appliance (Virtual Router Appliance, Vyatta, Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA) Supported by the Bring-your-own-IP (BYOIP) functionality \n IPsec Virtual private network (VPN) Use a virtual or physical network appliance (Virtual Router Appliance, Vyatta, Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA) Supported by the VPN-as-a-service offering \n Elastic load balancing Cloud Load Balancer Load Balancer for VPC \n Global load balancing Cloud Internet Services, Citrix Netscaler MPX Cloud Internet Services \n Hybrid connectivity NAT solution to bridge between IBM Cloud and your IT environment Bring your own private IP address without NAT or IPSec tunnels <br>Note: You can enable your VPC to access classic infrastructure resources. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage differentiators \n\nSee the following table for the storage differences between classic and VPC.\n\n\n\nTable 3.

You can run up to five queries simultaneously with a Standard plan instance of Data Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sample queries \n\nWhat does a typical query look like? The following sample queries give you an idea to get you started:\n\n\n\n Example of a table exploration query \n\nThe following query selects all columns of a table and limits the result to 50 rows. Use it to explore a particular table.\n\nSELECT \nFROM cos://us-geo/sql/customers.csv STORED AS CSV\nORDER BY CustomerID\nLIMIT 50\n\n\n\n\n\n Example of an exact target path specification \n\nThe following query writes an SQL result into an exact result path. Normally, Data Engine always appends jobid=<jobid> to the provided target path to ensure a unique result location with each query execution. However, in the following sample query, this suffix is eliminated by adding JOBPREFIX NONE to the path in the INTO clause.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-running"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02522-12274-13749", "score": 0.6382196545600891, "text": "\nSELECT COUNT() AS logLines FROM cos://eu-de/results-at/jobid=f178778e-7707-46a9-982d-1e89261b63a5 STORED AS PARQUET\nINTO cos://eu-de/results-marisa STORED AS CSV\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 3.6.

Good for general-purpose queries across one, some, or all indexed fields.\n\n\n\nA type=text index is created with an index definition like this:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n{ \"name\": \"firstname\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n{ \"name\": \"surname\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n{ \"name\": \"date\", \"type\": \"string\"}\n]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"textindexes\",\n\"name\": \"byNameAndDate\",\n\"type\": \"text\"\n}\n\nNotice that the fields array requires each attribute to be named and typed (unlike type=json indexes).\n\nThe resultant index can be used by queries that contain one or more of the indexed fields:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"sort\": [\"date\"],\n\"limit\": 10,", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07120-22745-24224", "score": 0.6103824973106384, "text": "\n[Shows that multiple responses are returned for the query.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/discovery-data/images/tut-sdu-rule-response.png)\n\nFigure 26.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09994-7-1823", "score": 0.6049122214317322, "text": "\nTime travel query syntax and timestamps \n\n\n\n Query syntax \n\nA SELECT query with one or more temporal clauses is a time travel query.

Calling this API with the appropriate information when a user performs an action sends a signal back to Discovery, which can then be viewed in the logs.\n\nEvents can help gather information on computing metrics (like clickthrough rate) to measure how effective the application is at helping end users find relevant information, or can be used to help seed training by reviewing the queries and clicks to start to build ground truth.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-usage"}]}

They deprecated v1 when they released v2. They also ensured that existing v1 consumers were aware that they had a certain timeline to move to v2. As this deadline approaches, ACME wants to see how quickly consumers are moving off v1, so they can offer assistance to valued partners.\n\nUsing a visualization similar to the one we just built, ACME has this information available at a glance.\n\nIn this tutorial, we walked through a number of activities to help you create useful combinations of API and consumer data.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-tut_insights_analytics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07163-7-1995", "score": 0.6462526321411133, "text": "\nImproving result relevance with the API \n\nYou can train Discovery to improve the relevance of query results for your particular organization or subject area.

In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 0.7865164279937744, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century. The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Indexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Indexing video \n\nLearn how indexing can speed up your query process.\n\n\n\n* Indexing video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 11 - Indexing.\n\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00512-28883-30259", "score": 0.7805413007736206, "text": "\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nAll Go examples require the service object to be initialized.

The selector is only slightly more complicated, but still the same as an equivalent global query.\n\n\n\n Query for recent results assuming today is 13 December 2018 \n\nThe partition is embedded in the HTTP path when issuing the request to IBM Cloudant:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl -X POST \"$SERVICE_URL/readings/_partition/bridge-9876/_find\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{\n\"selector\": {\n\"deviceID\": {\n\"$eq\": \"device-123456\"\n},\n\"ts\": {\n\"$gte\": \"20181213\"\n}\n}\n}'\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.FindResult;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostPartitionFindOptions;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.Selector;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nMap equalWithDeviceID = new HashMap<>();\nequalWithDeviceID.put(\"$eq\", \"device-123456\");\n\nMap greaterThanOrEqualWithTs = new HashMap<>();", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00539-6216-7731", "score": 0.7791566848754883, "text": "\nIf in doubt, use the [POST /{db}/_explain](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=javapostexplain) endpoint to check that an index is used, and the execution_stats: true parameter to measure the efficiency of each query.\n\nFor a type=json index to be used to support a query, it must match the fields that are used in the selector and sort parameters.

IBM Cloudant Query supports two types of indexes:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\" - a fixed-order index powered by IBM Cloudant's MapReduce API. Good for fixed, boilerplate queries that match every term in the index.\n* \"type\": \"text\" - a Lucene index powered by IBM Cloudant's Search API.

If you like, you can use the dictionary to pre-annotate document sets or annotation sets that you add later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lesson 3: Creating an annotation task \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to create annotation sets and use annotation tasks to track the work of human annotators in Knowledge Studio.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nAn annotation set is a subset of documents from an uploaded document set that you assign to a human annotator. The human annotator annotates the documents in the annotation set. To later use inter-annotator scores to compare the annotations that are added by each human annotator, you must assign at least two human annotators to different annotation sets. You must also specify that some percentage of documents overlap between the sets.\n\n> Note: In a realistic scenario, you would create as many annotation sets as needed, based on the number of human annotators who are working in the workspace. In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

Enabling a system entity makes it possible to quickly populate your skill with training data that is common to many use cases.\n\nSystem entities can be used to recognize a broad range of values for the object types they represent. For example, the @sys-number system entity matches any numerical value, including whole numbers, decimal fractions, or even numbers written out as words.\n\nSystem entities are centrally maintained, so any updates are available automatically.

You can't recover your server because your boot disk can't be resized.\n\n\n\n\n\n File system characteristics \n\nThe Hyper Protect Virtual Servers file system layout consists of one file system for the root and one file system for the /data mount points.\n\nIf the file system is full, your instance can break, which means you can no longer log on to your instance. The Hyper Protect Virtual Servers do not come with swap space configured, and it is not supported to add swap to the system.\n\nWithin /tmp is a tmpfs, which can use a large volume of RAM. Use /var/tmp for your applications when you need large volumes of temporary storage. Insufficient RAM can cause your system to behave unpredictably.\n\n\n\n Configuring logging for the Ubuntu server \n\nYou must manually configure logrotate and journald to leave a small percentage of the file systems free. To do this, configure SystemKeepFree=15% in /etc/systemd/journald.conf.\n\nCheck regularly that a percentage of the file system is still free. For the logrotatation configuration, make sure that your log files do not get too large. Compress and remove log files (or move them to your data volume) before they break your system.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-protect_vs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06178-0-1673", "score": 0.6424010396003723, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Why does the Ingress status show an ESSEF error? \n\nVirtual Private Cloud\n\nClassic infrastructure\n\nSatellite\n\n  What\u2019s happening \n\nWhen you check the status of your cluster's Ingress components by running the ibmcloud ks ingress status-report get command, you see an error similar to the following example.\n\nThe Opaque secret field expired or will expire soon (ESSEF).\n\n  Why it\u2019s happening \n\nYou have secrets in your cluster that have fields which are either expired or are about to expire in the next 5 days.\n\n  How to fix it \n\nReview the secrets in your cluster and update or remove them.\n\n\n\n1.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14311-3835-5367", "score": 0.6102133989334106, "text": "\n[Layer 2 bridge setup with a new bridge edge cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/5bdb37c0149145723c5437e8176651928565e722/vmwaresolutions/images/arch-pattern-l2-bridge-edge.svg)\n\nFigure 3.

If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires.

Data Security Broker Manager constructs a privacy schema that maps key IDs to data columns, thus enabling encryption in a simplified manner. Data Security Broker Shield carries out de-identification, masking, and encryption tasks for cloud databases.\n\nData Security Broker integrates with key management stores through a key virtualization layer. It also provides for a local key store, so you can use your own keys for data protection in the cloud.\n\nIs the instance hosted by Data Security Broker?\n\nData Security Broker software is hosted entirely in the customer's environment. Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield may be hosted on-premises or on cloud platforms such as IBM Cloud.\n\nWhat size instance is good for getting set up?\n\n30 gigabytes are sufficient for Data Security Broker Manager because it controls the Shields and the memory needed stays static. Sizing for Data Security Broker Shield depends on the number of shields and the number of concurrent users.\n\nWhat are the prerequisites for installing Data Security Broker?\n\nMake sure you meet the following requirements before configuring Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield:\n\n\n\n* Admin privileges for your platform\n* The user account used to log in to the Data Security Broker Shield host machine must have a home directory on that system\n* SSH client\n* Private key pair\n* Database privileges for encryption and migration\n\n\n\nDo Data Security Broker Manager and Shield run on different instances?\n\nTechnically, it is possible for the Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield to both run on the same host. However, it is recommended that separate host instances are provisioned for the Data Security Broker Manager and Data Security Broker Shield, to accommodate different workloads.\n\nWhich OS is necessary to set up the Data Security Broker Shield?\n\nData Security Broker Shield can be installed on instances running with Ubuntu 18 for IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster (IKS) or RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 for IBM Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes cluster (ROKS).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14690-4276-6282", "score": 0.5463916063308716, "text": "\nset security address-book global address-set SERVICE address SL19\nset security address-book global address-set SERVICE address SL20\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen icmp ping-death\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen ip source-route-option\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen ip tear-drop\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen tcp syn-flood alarm-threshold 1024\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen tcp syn-flood attack-threshold 200\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen tcp syn-flood source-threshold 1024\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen tcp syn-flood destination-threshold 2048\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen tcp syn-flood queue-size 2000\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen tcp syn-flood timeout 20\nset security screen ids-option untrust-screen tcp land\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone trust policy default-permit match source-address any\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone trust policy default-permit match destination-address any\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone trust policy default-permit match application any\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone trust policy default-permit then permit\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy default-permit match source-address any\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy default-permit match destination-address any\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy default-permit match application any\nset security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy default-permit then permit\nset security zones security-zone trust tcp-rst\nset security zones security-zone trust interfaces reth0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services all\nset security zones security-zone untrust screen untrust-screen\nset security zones security-zone untrust interfaces reth1.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services all\nset interfaces ge-0/0/1 gigether-options redundant-parent reth0", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vcsvsrx-iaas-def-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16016-9350-11500", "score": 0.545268177986145, "text": "\nUse Case 2: Customizing security groups and security group policies when creating a new resource \n\nThe following diagram illustrates the potential customization options when you create a new resource.

Security group and security group policy customization options when creating a new resource\n\n\n\n\n\n Use Case 3: Allow traffic between members of a security group \n\nThe more conventional way to set up your security group policy is to control traffic to and from your targets with specific rules that filter by IP addresses and ports.\n\nA more dynamic way you can set up your security group policy is to allow all inbound traffic from other targets that are also part of the security group. When you permit traffic between members of a security group, as resources are added or deleted from the security group, you don't have to set up individual permissions between each current member and each new member of a security group.\n\nFor example, say you have host A and host B in a security group, and you add a new host C. Normally, you would have to perform maintainance to allow host A and host B to send traffic to and from host C after you add host C to the security group.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-security-groups&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14953-5907-7890", "score": 0.5428117513656616, "text": "\nsecurity-group is.security-group.security-group.create Security Group was created \n security-group is.security-group.security-group.delete Security Group was deleted \n security-group is.security-group.security-group.update Security Group was updated \n security-group is.security-group.security-group.read One or more security groups were retrieved \n security-group is.security-group.security-group-rule.create Rule was added to Security Group \n security-group is.security-group.security-group-rule.delete Rule was removed from Security Group \n security-group is.security-group.security-group-rule.update Security Group Rule was updated \n security-group is.security-group.security-group-rule.read One or more security group rules was retrieved \n security-group is.security-group.security-group-interface.attach Interface was attached to Security Group \n security-group is.security-group.security-group-interface.detach Interface was removed from Security Group \n security-group is.security-group.security-group-interface.read One or more security group interfaces was retrieved \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Subnet events \n\n\n\nTable 8.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00962-3246-5702", "score": 0.5870978832244873, "text": "\nThe Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements.

The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds. Over time, the traffic that is sent to the new version is increased until all of the traffic is sent there, at which point you can stop the old production environment. For rapid rollback while deployment is in progress, you can route all of the traffic to the original production environment. Since this strategy requires two full production environments only during deployment, the overall resource usage is lower than for the Blue-Green deployment. The Canary release deployment strategy is the slowest to move from a previous release to a current release of the software that is being deployed. Canary deployments allow organizations to test two different software versions side by side in production.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you start this tutorial, make sure that you have the following resources in place:\n\n\n\n* An [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration), with a Standard plan.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-vpc"}]}

To differentiate between engine and network stalls, results are periodic rather than event-based.\n\n\n\nThe metrics can also help you estimate response jitter by examining the periodic arrival times. Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds. The level of precision is not restricted, so you can specify values such as 0.25 and 0.125. The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request. The service calculates and returns metrics in real-time at the requested interval.\n* With the asynchronous HTTP interface, you specify query parameters with a speech recognition request. The service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events. If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number. If the interval is larger than the duration of the audio, the service returns processing metrics only for transcription events.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding processing metrics", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00324-12617-14618", "score": 0.6539341807365417, "text": "\nMetrics with graphical views \n\nMetrics for an individual CDN are provided on the Overview tab of the customer portal for that CDN mapping. Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions. All objects in the bucket must be set with anonymous read or public read access.\n\nFor more information, see [Accelerate delivery of static files using a CDN](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-static-files-cdn).\n\n\n\n\n\n Path-based CDN mappings", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00331-35683-37392", "score": 0.647775411605835, "text": "\nReturns the real-time metrics for the current account, including the total data (bandwidth and hits) over the given period of time and the detailed data divided with the given time interval.

However, because the user's input includes the word tomorrow and the reservation node with slots is being processed, your assistant assumes the user is providing or updating the reservation date instead. The current node always gets priority. If you define a clear confirmation statement, such as, Ok, setting the reservation date to tomorrow, the user is more likely to realize there was a miscommunication and correct it.\n\nConversely, while filling slots, if the user provides a value that is not expected by any of the slots, there is a chance it will match against a completely unrelated root node that the user never intended to digress to.\n\nBe sure to do lots of testing as you configure the digression behavior.\n* When to use digressions instead of slot handlers: For general questions that users might ask at any time, use a root node that allows digressions into it, processes the input, and then goes back to the flow that was in progress. For nodes with slots, try to anticipate the types of related questions users might want to ask while filling in the slots, and address them by adding handlers to the node.\n\nFor example, if the node with slots collects the information required to fill out an insurance claim, then you might want to add handlers that address common questions about insurance. However, for questions about how to get help, or your stores locations, or the history of your company, use a root level node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disambiguation \n\nWhen you enable disambiguation, you instruct your assistant to ask users for help when it finds that more than one dialog node can respond to their input. Instead of guessing which node to process, your assistant shares a list of the best node options with the user, and asks the user to pick the correct one.\n\n![Shows a sample conversation between a user and the assistant, where the assistant asks for clarification from the user.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/disambig-demo.png)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-154863-157273", "score": 0.537898600101471, "text": "\n: The median conversation time metric, and corresponding filters, are being temporarily removed from the Overview page of the Improve section.

And you can subsequently change the node name without impacting how the node is referenced internally. The name you specify is saved as a title attribute of the node in the workspace JSON file and the system uses a unique ID that is stored in the name attribute to reference the node.\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 August 2017 \n\nUpdates to Korean, Japanese, and Italian\n: Language support has been enhanced for Korean, Japanese, and Italian.

As such, an update has been made to the algorithm so that accented and non-accented versions of words are treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever, for some languages like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word barri\u00f3, which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb barrer (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word barrio (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents.

This might be as simple as saying hello, or it might involve asking some questions to gather data the assistant needs before it can do anything else. Starting a new conversation is handled by the Greet customer action, which is automatically created (with a default greeting) when you create an assistant.\n\nThe Greet customer action is triggered in situations where your assistant initiates the conversation and then waits for input from the user. Depending on how users connect to your assistant, the Greeting action might not be triggered. (For more information, see [When the greeting action is triggered](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-start-conversationgreeting-triggered).)\n\n\n\n Customizing the greeting \n\nThe Greet customer action is automatically provided for any assistant. To customize this action:\n\n\n\n1. In the left-hand navigation pane of the actions editor, click Actions to expand the list.\n2. Click Set by assistant to see a list of built-in actions that are automatically provided when you create an assistant.\n3. Click Greet customer to edit the greeting action.\n\nNotice that for this action, you cannot specify the customer input that starts the action. That's because the greeting action is automatically sent when the assistant starts the conversation, before any user input is received.\n4. Under Conversation steps, click the first step. In the Assistant says field, edit the default text to specify the greeting text you want to use. For example, if you want your assistant to use a more casual tone, you might specify the text Hi! What can I do for you?\n5. To see your new greeting in action, click Preview. In the Preview pane, you should see your customized greeting appear.\n\n\n\n![Preview of customized greeting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/greeting-preview.png)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-start-conversation"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16321-1374-3426", "score": 0.7358434200286865, "text": "\n* [Send a text message during a phone conversation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsphone-actions-sms)\n\n\n\nIn some cases, you might want to combine response types to perform multiple actions.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}]}

When overlap occurs, it retains the leftmost, longest, non-overlapping span. This policy emulates the overlap-handling policy of most regular expression engines.\n\n\n\n* <priority_column>\n\nSpecifies a column of type Text, String, Integer, or Float. Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy.\n* <priority_order>\n\nSpecifies either ascending or descending order. Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy. The ascending order ensures that if a tuple T1 has priority 1 and a tuple T2 has priority 2, T1 has a higher priority than T2. By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical. All inputs with a null <consolidate target> result in a single output tuple, which is chosen randomly among those inputs. This behavior is similar to how tuples are consolidated with an identical span in the target column. The exception to resulting in a single output tuple is if the policy is ContainsButNotEqual. In that case, the null <consolidate target> outputs all inputs with null consolidate target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nExample 1: Consolidate on single column\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the field Person.name of all output tuples and to use the ContainedWithin consolidation policy to resolve overlap.\n\nconsolidate on Person.name\nusing 'ContainedWithin'\n\nExample 2: Consolidate on expression, involving multiple columns\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the result of applying the CombineSpans scalar function to fields Person.firstname and Person.lastname in each output tuple.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04161-8611-9846", "score": 0.6158698797225952, "text": "\n\"clientCountryName\": \"US\"\n}\n]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Query for the next page using filter \n\nTo get the next n results, specify a filter to exclude the last result from the previous query.

Different operating systems and code page conversion programs handle letter shaping in different ways. Unshaped storage is a standard for Windows systems, and Knowledge Studio presumes that Arabic text is stored unshaped. If you want to upload shaped text into Knowledge Studio, you must first convert the text to unshaped form by using standard tools, such as the International Components for Unicode (ICU) API (see the ArabicShaping Class at [http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/ArabicShaping.html](http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/ArabicShaping.html)).\n\n> Important: In some cases, lack of proper Arabic character shaping might cause content to be displayed incorrectly in the ground truth editor.\n\nWith respect to numeric shaping, Knowledge Studio treats numeric shaping as a storage-level property, similar to how Arabic content is handled on the iOS platform. Because a lot of Arabic content is created on platforms like Windows, which treat numeric shaping as a display-level property, you need to either convert content to make numeric shaping a storage-level property or use a Firefox browser when you use Knowledge Studio. Firefox supports the ability to set numeric shaping preferences explicitly at the browser level and enforce the appropriate display for all content shown in the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo configure numeric shaping in the Firefox browser:\n\n\n\n1. In the browser URL field, enter about:config. If you are shown a warning from Firefox, click the action to disregard the warning and continue.

If you have large amounts of confidential data, it is often helpful to use a Key Management System to assist in keeping your data secure. Key Protect uses the envelope encryption technique to keep your data resilient. Envelope encryption is the process of using encrypted keys, Data Encryption Keys and Root Keys, to protect your sensitive data.\n\nImagine that you plan to send a letter to a colleague. You want to discuss information that is highly sensitive, so you generate a secret code (Data Encryption Key) that is used to write (encrypt) the message in the letter.

Anyone who does not have an exact copy of the key will be unable to open the mailbox and see it's contents. When your colleague uses the key to unlock (unencrypt) the mailbox, they will need to know the secret code that the letter is written in to be able to understand the message.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08766-5724-7551", "score": 0.6601962447166443, "text": "\n[Application encryption by using PKCS #11](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/217f108cc44e2ce15fb692d4b57b4c628464e908/hs-crypto//images/application-encryption-pkcs11.svg)\n\nFigure 3.

Application-level encryption can be implemented by including a database proxy that intercepts and encrypts sensitive data in accordance with the pre-established data protection policy.\n\nData Security Broker encryption has some restrictions, like any other approaches to the application-level encryption implementation. The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location. Alternatively, you can secure the information with a password, but this reduces security, depending on the level of your password's strength.\n\nAccessibility If your key file is lost, your data is also lost. So, make a backup of your data and your key.\n\nDatabase operations carried out on encrypted versions of the data The information is kept in encrypted form in the database and the database engine and, consequently, the database administrator is never permitted to see the information in form of the plaintext.\n\nMany of today's server and network technologies allow for easier configuration and implementation to minimize the impact on utilization.

Locations can be made up of communications endpoints such as a Docker container, or of compute resources called hosts, which are used to form separate availability zones out of a given x86 infrastructure. \n Satellite Connector A Satellite Connector is a deployment model that enables only the secure communications from IBM Cloud to on-prem resources with a light weight container, deployed on the client's container platform hosts, such as Docker hosts. This option brings all the security and auditability of Satellite communication, but with much less resources required. \n Satellite hosts A Satellite host is a compute source that resides in your infrastructure provider or even locally. After you attach your hosts to a Satellite location, assign the hosts to the location control plane or to a Satellite-enabled IBM Cloud services to provide the computing power to run your service workloads. See [Attaching hosts to your location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-attach-hosts). \n Satellite-enabled service An IBM Cloud service that you can set up in a Satellite location, such as a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. The service is managed from the IBM Cloud region that your location is managed from, but you provide the infrastructure hosts to run the service's resources in your location.

They allow users to run quantum programs, which require specialized quantum hardware that is coupled closely with traditional \u201cclassical\u201d, computer hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is IBM launching Qiskit Runtime service? \n\nIBM made quantum computers available through the cloud in 2016. In 2022, IBM integrates with IBM Cloud\u00ae accounts to offer Qiskit Runtime API access. This access creates a smoother customer experience and the ability to combine Qiskit Runtime with other kinds of cloud compute resources for their particular workflow or application.\n\n\n\n\n\n What can Qiskit Runtime service not do? \n\nQiskit Runtime service provides access to IBM Quantum systems. Today\u2019s quantum systems are somewhat constrained in the size of problems that they can address due to available scale and quantum volume. Nonetheless, these systems can already be used to solve small problems and to explore this new and exciting field.\n\n\n\n\n\n What skills are required to use the Qiskit Runtime service? \n\nThe Qiskit Runtime service is meant to be accessible to anyone comfortable with Python. Use of Qiskit Runtime primitives requires expressing a problem as quantum circuits. The Qiskit application modules can facilitate this task for various application domains such as optimization, chemistry, finance, and machine learning. Creation of novel Qiskit Runtime programs requires more knowledge of the Qiskit backend interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the benefits of using Qiskit Runtime? \n\nQiskit Runtime provides access to industry-leading quantum hardware, closely coupled with IBM Cloud resources to enable optimized computing. Qiskit Runtime enables clients to experiment, learn, and prepare for a quantum-accelerated future.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are Qiskit Runtime primitives? \n\nThe Qiskit Runtime primitives define abstract interfaces for common tasks that are found in quantum applications.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-qiskit-runtime-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10835-22529-24347", "score": 0.5770721435546875, "text": "\nTo minimize these dependencies on your local environment, use the [Packaging Python code with a Docker virtual environment in a compressed file](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_python_virtenv) approach.

When the migration process is complete, you will see a success message.\n\n\n\nNetworking Bandwidth Metering for Classic\n\n\n\n* How is bandwidth metering priced?\n\n\n\n* Public bandwidth egress (or bandwidth allocation) pricing depends on regions. To learn more, visit [Bandwidth packages from IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/bandwidth) and contact a specialist.\n* Public bandwidth usage over GB allocation is charged per GB.\n\n\n\n* What IMS permissions do I need to view and change bandwidth allocations (or add and remove devices to and from bandwidth pools)?\n\nThe BANDWIDTH_MANAGE IMS infrastructure classic permission is the only required permission for bandwidth metering. After you allow this permission, you can complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* Create a bandwidth pool\n* Move a device into or out of a pool\n* Void a device\u2019s move into a pool\n* Cancel a pool\n\n\n\nCertain actions pertaining to bandwidth pools, including visibility, might be constrained based on device-level permission. Reconcile your device-level permissions on specific devices to manage their bandwidth and membership in pools.\n* Why don't I see the same number of devices as displayed on the devices count?\n\nThis issue might be due to permission restrictions because some users do not have permission to view specific devices. This issue might also be the result of devices that were reclaimed in the middle of the billing cycle, but are still contributing to the cost of the pool.\n* What kind of devices generate bandwidth?\n\nCompute devices use bandwidth.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-258172-260367", "score": 0.5621107220649719, "text": "\nThe improved process now offers:\n\n\n\n1. Faster copy of stock image to your private project.\n2. The stock image cannot be exported. One can do VM capture and export on a deployed VM that uses the stock image.\n3. Storage pool and tier of a stock image shows \"Empty\" (API) or \"Any\" (UI) as VM can be deployed to any tier/pool by using the stock image.\n\n\n\n* Can I select a specific resource group when I create a cloud connection?\n\nNO. When you create a cloud connection by using Power Systems Virtual Server, the cloud connection is always created in the default resource group even if you choose a specific resource group.\n\n\n\nQiskit Runtime\n\n\n\n* What is Qiskit Runtime service?\n\nQiskit Runtime service is a runtime environment through the IBM Cloud that provides access to the IBM Quantum processors and simulators. They allow users to run quantum programs, which require specialized quantum hardware that is coupled closely with traditional \u201cclassical\u201d, computer hardware.\n* Why is IBM launching Qiskit Runtime service?\n\nIBM made quantum computers available through the cloud in 2016. In 2022, IBM integrates with IBM Cloud\u00ae accounts to offer Qiskit Runtime API access. This access creates a smoother customer experience and the ability to combine Qiskit Runtime with other kinds of cloud compute resources for their particular workflow or application.\n* What can Qiskit Runtime service not do?\n\nQiskit Runtime service provides access to IBM Quantum systems. Today\u2019s quantum systems are somewhat constrained in the size of problems that they can address due to available scale and quantum volume. Nonetheless, these systems can already be used to solve small problems and to explore this new and exciting field.\n* What skills are required to use the Qiskit Runtime service?\n\nThe Qiskit Runtime service is meant to be accessible to anyone comfortable with Python. Use of Qiskit Runtime primitives requires expressing a problem as quantum circuits. The Qiskit application modules can facilitate this task for various application domains such as optimization, chemistry, finance, and machine learning. Creation of novel Qiskit Runtime programs requires more knowledge of the Qiskit backend interface.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs"}]}

To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response. This means that if you define three conditioned responses for a dialog node, each conditioned response can have no more than 5 response types added to it.\n\nYou cannot add more than one Connect to human agent or more than one Search skill response type to a single dialog node.\n\nDo not add more than one option response type to a single dialog node because both lists are displayed at once, but the customer can choose an option from only one of them.\n3.

For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating intents \n\n\n\n1.

You provide information about the subjects or tasks that your users need help with, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n* Actions skill : Offers a simple interface where anyone can build a conversational flow for your assistant to follow. The complex process of training data creation occurs behind the scenes automatically. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-addskill-add-actions-skill)\n* Dialog skill: Offers a set of editors that you use to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree. You use the graphical dialog editor to create a script of sorts for your assistant to read from when it interacts with your customers. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses.

If a dedicated language model is not available for your target language, create a skill that uses the universal language model. The universal model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from training data written in the target language that you add to it.

The coverage metric looks for occurrences of nodes with the anything_else condition being processed in the user conversation logs. It uses this information to determine the frequency with which your dialog is able to match user requests to intents that can address them. The node is registered by the metric if it conditions on anything_else alone or when it's used in combination with another condition, such as anything_else && positive_feedback.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-start"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02882-33778-35796", "score": 0.7182802557945251, "text": "\nFor example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers.

If you choose to create a type system from scratch, follow these guidelines.\n\nFocus on creating an inventory of entity types and relation types that cover the information that is needed by the application in which the type system will be used. Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application. For example, if the source document contains the sentence Murder on the Orient Express made headlines, then how you define entity types to capture the key information in the sentence differs depending on the type of application that will use the model that you build with the type system.\n\n\n\n* For a literary application, you might create types that capture this information:\n\n[NOVEL] [CRITICAL_RECEPTION]\n\n[Murder on the Orient Express] [made headlines]\n* For a public safety application, you might create these types:\n\n[EVENT_CRIME] [LOCATION]\n\n[Murder] on the [Orient Express] made headlines", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-typesystem"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16454-11402-13678", "score": 0.6266767978668213, "text": "\nFor example, if the source document contains the sentence Murder on the Orient Express made headlines, then how you define entity types to capture the key information in the sentence differs depending on the type of application that will use the model that you build with the type system.\n\n\n\n* For a literary application, you might create types that capture this information:\n\n[NOVEL] [CRITICAL_RECEPTION]\n\n[Murder on the Orient Express] [made headlines]\n* For a public safety application, you might create these types:\n\n[EVENT_CRIME] [LOCATION]\n\n[Murder] on the [Orient Express] made headlines\n\n\n\nThe structure is often driven by characteristics of the documents from which information will be extracted, but should always be tempered by what information the application will actually use from those documents. For example, you might be creating an application that gains insights from medical records. To build the type system, you start looking at patient records to see what kinds of information must be captured. The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system. And in making the decision to make this omission, recognize that this means that sections of your patient record documents will be left unannotated. That is alright and even expected.\n\nMentions annotate a span of text; they do not replace the text. A type system is not an ontology for a domain. Expect to have general entity types such as MEDICATION_NAME instead of having an entity type for each medicine type. The document text will continue to contain the specific medicine name. It will just be enhanced with an annotation that identifies its type, which makes the information easier to find and extract programmatically.\n\nAs you get started, define 10 to 40 entity types and relation types. Stay to the lower end of the range if the human annotators who will be working on the workspace are not highly specialized in the field. Do not define more than 50.\n\nPlan to spend a good amount of time defining the type system before your team begins any human annotation tasks. When the team does start to annotate documents, begin with a small set, perhaps no more than 50.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-typesystem"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07411-14782-16101", "score": 0.6221736669540405, "text": "\nName _sip._tcp.video.example.com\nType SRV\nCreated On 2020-04-10 09:15:56.940189115 +0000 UTC\nModified On 2020-04-10 09:15:56.940189115 +0000 UTC\nTTL 900\nData\nport 953\npriority 10\ntarget media.example.com\nweight 10\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating type 'TXT' resource record \n\nUse the ibmcloud dns resource-record-create command with --type TXT option to create a type TXT resource record. --name and --text are mandatory options.\n\n$ ibmcloud dns resource-record-create $DNS_ZONE_ID --type TXT --name text --text \"This is a text record.\"\nCreating resource record in zone 'example.com:f7f40364-a5e6-48f7-9fc9-387434c579ae' for service instance 'DNS Services-km' ...\nOK\n\nID TXT:92648285-c7e5-49ef-bf8b-a5be91d5c5d3\nName text.example.com\nType TXT\nCreated On 2020-04-10 09:16:50.169135062 +0000 UTC\nModified On 2020-04-10 09:16:50.169135062 +0000 UTC\nTTL 900\nData\ntext This is a text record.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating type 'MX' resource record \n\nUse ibmcloud dns resource-record-create command with --type MX option to create a type MX resource record. --name and --exchange are the mandatory options.\n\n$ ibmcloud dns resource-record-create $DNS_ZONE_ID --type MX --name mail --preference 10 --exchange exchange.example.com\nCreating resource record in zone 'example.com:f7f40364-a5e6-48f7-9fc9-387434c579ae' for service instance 'DNS Services-km' ...\nOK", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dns-svcs?topic=dns-svcs-managing-dns-records"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05590-15026-16874", "score": 0.6022577881813049, "text": "\nibmcloud cbr rule-create --api-types crn:v1:bluemix:public:containers-kubernetes::::api-type:cluster --description \"privateAccess=allowAll, publicAccess=oneIP\" --service-name containers-kubernetes --service-instance CLUSTER-ID --context-attributes endpointType=private --context-attributes endpointType=public,networkZoneId=allow-client-ip\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating rules from the console \n\n\n\n1.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00962-3246-5702", "score": 0.5870978832244873, "text": "\nThe Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements.

The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds. Over time, the traffic that is sent to the new version is increased until all of the traffic is sent there, at which point you can stop the old production environment. For rapid rollback while deployment is in progress, you can route all of the traffic to the original production environment. Since this strategy requires two full production environments only during deployment, the overall resource usage is lower than for the Blue-Green deployment. The Canary release deployment strategy is the slowest to move from a previous release to a current release of the software that is being deployed. Canary deployments allow organizations to test two different software versions side by side in production.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you start this tutorial, make sure that you have the following resources in place:\n\n\n\n* An [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration), with a Standard plan.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-vpc"}]}

Similar to other use cases, all considerations for scalability, and other Qualities of Services apply.\n\nSee the following example that includes a discussion of [using Serverless as an API backend](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.htmlACoupleOfExamples).\n\n\n\n\n\n Mobile back end \n\nMany mobile applications require server-side logic. However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills. Since mobile applications often have unpredictable load patterns, you want to use a Cloud Functions solution like IBM Cloud\u00ae. This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications.

After a new push destination is created, you see an entry IBM Cloud push service in the Destination list. You must configure your push destination by adding credentials for Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).\n\nEach application and platform requires a separate push destination.\n\nYou can use Pre-production destination, as low-cost push destination, for your development and test environments.

The subscription also needs a topic to filter events of interest from your sources. When an event lands in the topic, Event Notifications immediately routes the event notification to your registered devices.\n\nThe push service works along with an app on your users' mobile devices. You must instrument the app with the Event Notifications push SDK. The app must ensure that users consent to notifications, and then the SDK helps to register their mobile devices.

Multiple instances of App Configuration within a single environment are all considered separate application instances, as are individual App Configuration instances in multiple environments (such as test, development, staging, or production).\n\nA single instance of App Configuration can serve multiple environments, and in fact the service is designed to do so.\n\nActive Entity ID - An active entity ID is a unique identifier for each entity that interacts with the App Configuration service. For example, an entity might be an instance of an app that runs on a mobile device, a microservice that runs on the cloud, or a component of infrastructure that runs that microservice. For any entity to interact with App Configuration, it must provide a unique entity ID. This task is most easily accomplished by programming your app or microservice to send the Entity ID by using the App Configuration SDK.\n\nAPI Call - An API call is the invocation of the App Configuration through a programmable interface.\n\nExactly what constitutes an API call varies depending on the entity type (for example, a microservice or a mobile app). For server-side entities like microservices, when the state of a feature flag or property changes in the App Configuration, a websocket connection notifies the SDK in the microservice that a state change occurred. The microservice then calls back into the App Configuration to retrieve the update. This action is an API call.\n\nAn API call also occurs on startup to the retrieve the initial configuration state.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods.

Similar to other use cases, all considerations for scalability, and other Qualities of Services apply.\n\nSee the following example that includes a discussion of [using Serverless as an API backend](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.htmlACoupleOfExamples).\n\n\n\n\n\n Mobile back end \n\nMany mobile applications require server-side logic. However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills. Since mobile applications often have unpredictable load patterns, you want to use a Cloud Functions solution like IBM Cloud\u00ae. This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02731-4670-6607", "score": 0.6982012987136841, "text": "\n: Server SDK: You can protect your back-end resources that are hosted on IBM Cloud and your web apps by using the server SDK.

You have an appointment for 10:00 AM on Sep 12. See you then!\n\nSuccess! The application now uses the Watson Assistant service to understand natural-language input, and it displays the appropriate responses.\n\nThis simple example illustrates how you can build a custom client app to communicate with the assistant. Of course, a real-world application would use a more sophisticated user interface, and it might integrate with other applications such as a customer database or other business systems. It would also need to send additional data to the assistant, such as a user ID to identify each unique user. But the basic principles of how the application interacts with the Watson Assistant service would remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the v1 runtime API \n\nUsing the v2 API is the recommended way to build a runtime client application that communicates with the Watson Assistant service. However, some older applications might still be using the v1 runtime API, which includes a similar method for sending messages to the workspace within a dialog skill. Note that if your app uses the v1 runtime API, it communicates directly with the workspace, bypassing the skill orchestration and state-management capabilities of the assistant.\n\nFor more information about the v1 /message method and context, see the [v1 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1message).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03118-4-2208", "score": 0.6496058702468872, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience. To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Watson Assistant API overview \n\nYou can use the Watson Assistant REST APIs, and the corresponding SDKs, to develop applications that interact with the service.\n\n\n\n Client applications \n\nTo build a virtual assistant or other client application that communicates with an assistant at run time, use the new v2 API. By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy /message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

If you configure one of the supported contact center integrations, the web chat can open a separate chat window in which the customer can communicate with a live agent.\n\nYour assistant can then initiate a transfer in situations when the assistant is unable to handle a customer's requests.

As such, both accented and non-accented versions of words might be treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever for some languages, like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity might implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word \"barri\u00f3\", which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb \"barrer\" (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word \"barrio\" (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" vs. \"una\". In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13333-1778-4047", "score": 0.5872489213943481, "text": "\nYou can set a threshold below which such events are ignored.\n\n\n\nBy default, speech activity detection is configured to provide optimal performance for the general case for each model. For specific cases, the default settings might not be optimal and can lead either to slow transcription or to word insertions and deletions. You are encouraged to experiment with different settings to determine which values work best for your audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity \n\nUse the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter to adjust the sensitivity of speech activity detection. Use the parameter to suppress word insertions from music, coughing, and other non-speech events. The service biases the audio it passes for speech recognition by evaluating chunks of the input audio against prior models of speech and non-speech activity.\n\nSpecify a float value between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.5, which provides a reasonable compromise for the level of sensitivity. A value of 0.0 suppresses all audio (no speech is transcribed). A value of 1.0 suppresses no audio (speech detection sensitivity is disabled). The values increase on a monotonic curve of sensitivity versus speech. Specifying one or two decimal places of precision (for example, 0.55) is typically more than sufficient.\n\nThis parameter can affect both the quality and the latency of speech recognition:\n\n\n\n* Lower values can decrease latency because less audio is potentially passed for speech recognition. However, a low setting might discard chunks of audio that contain actual speech, losing viable content from the transcript.\n* Higher values can increase latency because more audio is potentially passed for speech recognition. However, a high setting might pass chunks of audio that contain non-speech events, adding spurious content to the transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity example \n\nThe following example request specifies a value of 0.6 for the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter with the synchronous HTTP interface.

Keyword matching is case-insensitive, so Speech to Text is effectively equivalent to speech to text.\n\nFor US English, the service normalizes each keyword to match spoken versus written strings. For example, it normalizes numbers to match how they are spoken as opposed to written. For other languages, keywords must be specified as they are spoken.\n* Use the keywords_threshold parameter to specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0 for a keyword match. The threshold indicates the lower bound for the level of confidence the service must have for a word to match the keyword. A keyword is spotted in the transcript only if its confidence is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.\n\nSpecifying a small threshold can potentially produce many matches. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. Omit the parameter to return no matches.\n\n\n\nThe following limits apply to keyword spotting:\n\n\n\n* You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request.\n* A single keyword can have a maximum length of 1024 characters. The maximum effective length for double-byte languages might be shorter.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13741-6046-8162", "score": 0.5794650912284851, "text": "\nYou can use the parameter to direct the service to spell out individual characters more slowly, in groups of one, two, or three characters.

Timing information is useful for synchronizing the input text and the audio.\n\nYou can use the SSML <mark> element to identify specific locations, such as word boundaries, in the audio.

The speech that they produce, in addition to having a very conversational style, reflects the mood of the text. You can embellish the voices' natural tendencies by indicating that all or some of the text is to emphasize a specific style: cheerful, empathetic, neutral, or uncertain. You use SSML to indicate the style and the text to which it is to be applied.

The following JSON example shows a response that includes text and an image:\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"text\",\n\"text\": \"OK, here's a picture of a dog.\"\n},\n{\n\"response_type\": \"image\",\n\"source\": \"http://example.com/dog.jpg\"\n}\n],\n\"text\" : [\"OK, here's a picture of a dog.\"]\n},\n\"user_id\": \"faf4a112-f09f-4a95-a0be-43c496e6ac9a\"\n}\nShow more\n\nAs this example shows, the text response (OK, here's a picture of a dog.) is also returned in the output.text array. This is included for backward compatibility for older applications that do not support the output.generic format.\n\nIt is the reponsibility of your client application to handle all response types appropriately. In this case, your application would need to display the specified text and image to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n Response types", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03184-4-2189", "score": 0.6560741662979126, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

A client action defines a request for a client-side process, in a standardized format that your external client application can understand. Your external client application must use the provided information to carry out the requested action, which can be a local programmatic function, a call to an external service, or any other action the client can perform. The client then returns the result from the action to the dialog, which can process it further, display it to the user, or use it as a condition to determine subsequent flow.\n\nUnlike other action types, a client action does not make a direct call itself. Instead, it simply makes a request for the client application to do something, in the form of an action object that is included in a response from the dialog (along with any output text). This object includes a name identifying the requested action, along with any required parameters and the name of a context variable where the result should be stored. It is the responsibility of the client application to carry out the requested action, store the result in the context, and send it back to the dialog with the next message.\n\nYou might call a client application to do the following types of things:\n\n\n\n* Validate information that you collected from the user.\n* Do calculations or string manipulations on user input that are too complex for supported SpEL expression methods to handle.\n* Get data from another application or service.\n\n\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how client actions work, using the example of an action to get a weather forecast.\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-actions-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03114-14238-16113", "score": 0.6547032594680786, "text": "\n\"object_1\": {\n\"property_1\": \"Another string value\"\n}\n}\n}\n]\n},\n\"user_id\": \"faf4a112-f09f-4a95-a0be-43c496e6ac9a\"\n}\nShow more\n\nYour application can parse and display the data in any way you choose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example: Implementing option responses \n\nTo show how a client application might handle option responses, which prompt the user to select from a list of choices, we can extend the client example described in [Building a client application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-client). This is a simplified client app that uses standard input and output to handle three intents (sending a greeting, showing the current time, and exiting from the app):\n\nWelcome to the Watson Assistant example!\n>> hello\nGood day to you.\n>> what time is it?\nThe current time is 12:40:42 PM.\n>> goodbye\nOK! See you later.\n\nIf you want to try the example code shown in this topic, you should first set up the required workspace and obtain the API details you will need. For more information, see [Building a client application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-client).\n\n\n\n Receiving an option response \n\nThe option response can be used when you want to present the user with a finite list of choices, rather than interpreting natural language input. This can be used in any situation where you want to enable the user to quickly select from a set of unambiguous options.\n\nIn our simplified client app, we will use this capability to select from a list of the actions the assistant supports (greetings, displaying the time, and exiting). In addition to the three intents previously shown (hello, time, and goodbye), the example workspace supports a fourth intent: menu, which is matched when the use asks to see a list of available actions.\n\nWhen the workspace recognizes the menu intent, the dialog responds with an option response:\n\n{\n\"output\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02872-1338-3179", "score": 0.6544042229652405, "text": "\n* Get data from another application or service.\n\n\n\nFor information about how to call an external service, such as a Cloud Functions web action, see [Making a programmatic call from a dialog node](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-webhooks).\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how you can use a client call to get weather forecast information, and return it to the user.\n\n![Shows someone asking for a weather forecast, the dialog sending a request to a client app, which sends it to the external service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/forecast.png)\n\nNote that the client action calls the MyWeatherFunction program, which is a program that the client application runs. The client application makes the call to the external web service (/weather) to get the actual forecast information. The client application then returns the response to the dialog. When you add a client action to a dialog, a client application must exist that either does the processing itself or that passes information between your dialog and any external back-end services that you want to use.\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo make a programmatic call to a client application from a dialog node, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The application now uses the Watson Assistant service to understand natural-language input, and it displays the appropriate responses.\n\nThis simple example illustrates how you can build a custom client app to communicate with the assistant. Of course, a real-world application would use a more sophisticated user interface, and it might integrate with other applications such as a customer database or other business systems. It would also need to send additional data to the assistant, such as a user ID to identify each unique user. But the basic principles of how the application interacts with the Watson Assistant service would remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the v1 runtime API \n\nUsing the v2 API is the recommended way to build a runtime client application that communicates with the Watson Assistant service. However, some older applications might still be using the v1 runtime API, which includes a similar method for sending messages to the workspace within a dialog skill. Note that if your app uses the v1 runtime API, it communicates directly with the workspace, bypassing the skill orchestration and state-management capabilities of the assistant.\n\nFor more information about the v1 /message method and context, see the [v1 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1message).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}]}

Therefore, you need to manually install and configure the required VMware components, such as ESXi hosts, vCenter, vSAN or NSX-T components.\n\nThis tutorial walks you through creating your own IBM Cloud VPC with multiple subnets as required to support vSphere networking and the provisioning of IBM Cloud Bare Metal Servers for Virtual Private Cloud (BMS) for a basic VMware vSphere deployment. After the IBM Cloud VPC and Bare Metal Servers for VPC have been provisioned, the tutorial covers a manual deployment of the vCenter, creating VMware compute cluster with vSAN or NFS shared storage options.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.

Pricing plans\n\n Plan Inclusions Capabilities \n\n Lite This plan is a free evaluation plan that includes 10 active entity IDs and 5,000 API calls. <br>Lite plan services are deleted after 30 days of inactivity. Includes all App Configuration capabilities for evaluation only. Not to be used for production. \n Standard The monthly instance price includes 1000 active entity IDs and 100,000 API calls. This plan includes feature flags in addition to the property management capabilities. \n Enterprise The monthly instance price includes 10,000 active entity IDs and 1,000,000 API calls. This plan includes percentage rollout and targeting segments in addition to property management and feature flags that are found in the Standard plan. \n\n\n\n* What are the charges to use App Configuration?\n\nThe fundamental pricing metrics for App Configuration are Application Instance, Active Entity ID, and API Call.\n\nApplication Instance - An Application Instance is a uniquely named copy of App Configuration created by you but managed by IBM. Multiple instances of App Configuration within a single environment are all considered separate application instances, as are individual App Configuration instances in multiple environments (such as test, development, staging, or production).\n\nA single instance of App Configuration can serve multiple environments, and in fact the service is designed to do so.\n\nActive Entity ID - An active entity ID is a unique identifier for each entity that interacts with the App Configuration service.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}]}

To convert an account, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule).\n\nEach enterprise supports only a single billing currency. All accounts must use the enterprise billing currency before you add them to the enterprise. Existing accounts that are imported into the enterprise no longer separately manage their billing. As a result, subscription credit can't be added to individual child accounts. Subscription credit must be added to the enterprise account, where it becomes part of the enterprise credit pool.\n\n\n\n Billing transition when importing accounts \n\nWhen you import an existing account to an enterprise, its billing and invoicing transitions to being managed by the enterprise account. This transition includes the following changes to the account.\n\n\n\n* For Subscription accounts that are added, the account type is changed to Pay-As-You-Go. This change reflects that the account does not have its own subscriptions, but it still has full access to production-ready, billable services.\n* Subscriptions and promotions from each account are moved to the enterprise account, where they become part of the credit pool. After the move, each subscription has the same remaining credit and term period, but the subscription is given a new unique ID.\n* Access to billing and payment information for future billing periods is restricted to users in the enterprise account. Users in a child account can't access billing and payment information, such as invoices, payments, or subscriptions, even if they previously had access in the account. To view or manage billing, users need to be invited to the enterprise account and given access to the Billing service in that account.\n* Usage is invoiced to the enterprise account for the entire month when the account was added. For example, if you add an account to the enterprise on 15 June, all of the usage for the month of June is reflected in the July invoice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shared credit pool \n\nThe enterprise credit pool consolidates credit from all accounts in the enterprise and shares it with the accounts.

Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts.

The object version can be be deleted after this date is passed (assuming there are no legal holds on the object version).\n\nThe retention period for new objects can be inherited from the default value set on the bucket, or it can be explicitly defined when writing the object by specifying a Retain Until Date.\n\nWhen you use bucket default settings, you don\u2019t specify a Retain Until Date.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.7063528299331665, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6511023044586182, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04175-0-1274", "score": 0.7018718719482422, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04183-0-2205", "score": 0.658804178237915, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Securing your data in CIS \n\nTo ensure that you can securely manage your data when you use IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services, it is important to know exactly what data is stored and encrypted and how to delete any stored personal data.\n\n\n\n  How your data is stored and encrypted in CIS \n\nCIS interacts with Cloudflare services using a channel that is fully encrypted end-to-end using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. CIS does not store any customer data. Configuration data about your specific CIS configuration is encrypted in transit and at rest. CIS configuration data is deleted on your request through the UI, CLI, or API.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Protecting your sensitive data in CIS \n\nAll data related to CIS configuration is not considered sensitive data.

The data retention policy is included in the CIS service description, which you can find in [IBM Cloud Terms](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-terms). When a CIS instance is deleted by the UI, CLI, or API, the instance data is retained for seven days from deletion.\n\nBefore deleting an instance, all the domains in the instance must be removed.\n\nDeleting the CIS instance removes all data.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Restoring deleted data for CIS \n\nCIS can currently restore the deleted instance. After you delete an instance of CIS, you can restore the deleted service instance within the data retention period of seven days. After the seven-day period expires, the service instance is permanently deleted.\n\nTo view which service instances are available for restoration, use the ibmcloud resource reclamations command.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "score": 0.6670485734939575, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6624189615249634, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6694908142089844, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "score": 0.6610467433929443, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

So that's again going to be the secrets manager service provided, and that service needs to talk to Cloud IAM again. Now that we've got this established, what type of credential do we have here? The credential that we have is called DB config. So let's think about the scenario we just walked through: this DB config allows this lending application a service to be able to have read access or be able to take a specific set of information from a given table within a database that has some IP data and some other highly sensitive information in it. So, in a scenario in which these DB configs are not stored properly or the service that they stored in is compromised, what we ultimately get is a pretty catastrophic scenario for the provider, because the provider of this service of this lending application then has to go and tell its customer that a bad actor was able to take advantage of access that it got wrongfully to its DB config. And, that DB config ultimately allowed that bad actor to steal their data and do whatever they wanted with it against that customer.

Protecting your cloud network by using firewalls and intrusion prevention system devices is imperative for protecting your cloud-based workloads.\n\n\n\n Firewall configuration \n\nKubernetes clusters should be secured by a firewall to protect the network from unauthorized access from internet traffic. By default IBM Cloud Kubernetes service clusters are preconfigured with a Calico network plug-in that secures the public network interface of every worker node in the cluster. By configuring Kubernetes and Calico network policies you can easily control the inbound and outbound network traffic.

In version 3, a vulnerability report (scan result) is generated when the image is pushed to the registry (and is regenerated regularly thereafter). When Vulnerability Advisor is queried, a scan result is retrieved that might be up to 5 days old. Scan results are deleted 30 days after they are generated.\n\nIn version 4, the image is indexed when it is first pushed to Container Registry registry, and that index report is stored in the database. When Vulnerability Advisor is queried, the image index report is retrieved, and a vulnerability assessment is produced. This action happens dynamically every time Vulnerability Advisor is queried. Therefore, no pregenerated scan result exists that requires deleting.

If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16242-3349-4513", "score": 0.585059642791748, "text": "\n[Action response mode](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/response-mode-modal.png)\n\nAction response mode\n2.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

It's important to distinguish how each action is triggered. When a user enters a question or request, the phrase is evaluated across all the Customer starts with examples in every action. If two actions have similar phrase examples, then the wrong action might get triggered by your user's question.\n\n\n\n Confidence scoring \n\nBehind the scenes, Watson Assistant determines a confidence score for each phrase. The score is absolute, meaning that a confidence score is assigned based on a predetermined scale, and not relative to other customer phrases.

The customer configures their servers and uses gateways and firewalls to route traffic between servers to protect workloads from network threats. Protecting your cloud network by using firewalls and intrusion prevention system devices is imperative for protecting your cloud-based workloads.\n\n\n\n Firewall configuration \n\nKubernetes clusters should be secured by a firewall to protect the network from unauthorized access from internet traffic. By default IBM Cloud Kubernetes service clusters are preconfigured with a Calico network plug-in that secures the public network interface of every worker node in the cluster. By configuring Kubernetes and Calico network policies you can easily control the inbound and outbound network traffic.

These recommendations allow CIS to connect to your origin servers properly. They\u2019ll help you prevent any issues with API or HTTPS traffic, and help your logs capture the correct IP addresses of your customers, rather than the protective CIS IP addresses.\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to set up:\n\n\n\n* Restore the originating IPs of your customers\n* Incorporate CIS IP addresses\n* Make sure your security settings don't interfere with API traffic\n* Configure your security settings as strictly as possible\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 1: Know how to restore the originating IPs of your customers \n\nAs a reverse proxy, CIS provides the origination IP in these headers:\n\n\n\n* CF-Connecting-IP\n* X-Forwarded-For\n* True-Client-IP (optional)\n\n\n\nYou can restore user IP addresses using a variety of tools, for infrastructures such as Apache, Windows IIS, and NGINX.\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: Incorporate CIS IP addresses to make integration smoother \n\nHere are the two steps to take:\n\n\n\n* Remove any rate limiting of CIS IP addresses\n* Set up your ACLs to allow only CIS IP addresses and other trusted parties\n\n\n\nYou can find the updated list of IP ranges for IBM CIS [at this location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-cis-allowlisted-ip-addresses).\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 3: Review your security settings to make sure they don\u2019t interfere with API traffic \n\nIBM CIS usually accelerates API traffic by removing connection overhead.

When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02590-7911-9371", "score": 0.6775263547897339, "text": "\nTo prevent [dangerous client bugs and backward-compatibility hazards](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-robustnesssanitation-and-validation), unrecognized query parameters SHOULD and invalid parameter values MUST result in a 400 status code and appropriate error response model.\n\n\n\n\n\n Case insensitivity \n\nQuery parameter names SHOULD NOT be case-normalized to support case insensitivity; a parameter that does not match the case of a defined parameter but otherwise matches its name SHOULD be treated as any other extraneous input\n\n[4].\n\nHowever, parameter name case normalization MAY be supported for backward compatibility with existing clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n Parameter duplication \n\nRequests that provide a query string with duplicate single-value\n\n[5]query parameters of the same name and differing values[6] MUST result in a 400 status and appropriate error response model.

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more.

The WebSocket interface\n\n\n\n* Provides a single-socket, full-duplex communication channel. The interface lets the client send multiple requests to the service and receive results over a single connection in an asynchronous fashion.\n* Provides a much simpler and more powerful programming experience. The service sends event-driven responses to the client's messages, eliminating the need for the client to poll the server.\n* Allows you to establish and use a single authenticated connection indefinitely. The HTTP interfaces require you to authenticate each call to the service.\n* Reduces latency. Recognition results arrive faster because the service sends them directly to the client. The HTTP interface requires four distinct requests and connections to achieve the same results.\n* Reduces network utilization. The WebSocket protocol is lightweight. It requires only a single connection to perform live-speech recognition.\n* Enables audio to be streamed directly from browsers (HTML5 WebSocket clients) to the service.\n* Returns results as soon as they are available when you use a next-generation model or request interim results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using speech recognition parameters \n\nThe service's speech recognition interfaces share largely common parameters for transcribing speech to text.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-features"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13455-7-1568", "score": 0.6419353485107422, "text": "\nThe WebSocket interface \n\nThe WebSocket interface of the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service is the most natural way for a client to interact with the service.

To use the WebSocket interface for speech recognition, you first use the /v1/recognize method to establish a persistent connection with the service. You then send text and binary messages over the connection to initiate and manage recognition requests.\n\nBecause of their advantages, WebSockets are the preferred mechanism for speech recognition. For more information, see [Advantages of the WebSocket interface](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-featuresfeatures-websocket-advantages). For more information about the WebSocket interface and its parameters, see the [API & SDK reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n Managing a WebSocket connection \n\nThe WebSocket recognition request and response cycle has the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The method is available at the following endpoint:\n\nwss://api.{location}.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id}/v1/synthesize\n\nwhere {location} indicates where your application is hosted:\n\n\n\n* us-south for Dallas\n* us-east for Washington, DC\n* eu-de for Frankfurt\n* au-syd for Sydney\n* jp-tok for Tokyo\n* eu-gb for London\n* kr-seo for Seoul\n\n\n\nAnd {instance_id} is the unique identifier of the service instance.\n\nThe examples in the documentation abbreviate wss://api.{location}.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id} to {ws_url}. So all WebSocket examples call the method as {ws_url}/v1/synthesize.\n\nA WebSocket client calls the /v1/synthesize method with the following query parameters to establish an authenticated connection with the service:\n\naccess_token (required string)\n: Pass a valid access token to authenticate with the service.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-usingWebSocket"}]}

For more information, see [Configuring backup call center support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-transfer-service).\n* Call failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent.\n\n\n\nIf, after you transfer the call to a human, the connection to a live agent fails for any reason, you can configure what to do.\n\n\n\n* Transfer failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller if transfer to a live agent fails. The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues.

If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-31953-34073", "score": 0.5825196504592896, "text": "\nDeploy your assistant on the phone in minutes\n: We have partnered with [IntelePeer](https://intelepeer.com/) to enable you to generate a phone number for free within the phone integration.

Depending on the IVR service provider, you might need to configure call transfer to use a SIP BYE request instead. Use the transfer_method attribute to specify how to transfer the call, using either refer or hangup. When transfer_method is set to hangup instead of refer, the behavior of the transfer action changes. Instead of sending a SIP REFER request, the phone integration plays back any associated text and then hangs up the call by sending a SIP BYE request.\n\nAfter the hangup, the phone integration passes the transfer destination that is specified in the url attribute to the call anchor in the BYE message. The header field that contains the transfer target is determined by the transfer_target_header attribute.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages.

This ensures all request and response data between toolchains, pipelines, and IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager and IBM\u00ae Key Protect provider instances is kept within the in-boundary private IBM Cloud network and does not travel over any public network channels.\n\nIn addition to manually selecting chosen secrets on a one-by-one basis from any bound secrets integrations in a toolchain, the option of using a Secret Hint is also available. This option enables a toolchain template to be predefined with suggested secrets names (also known as Hints) that are a short form secret reference. The format of a secret hint is {vault::secret-name} whereby no secret integration name is included. This provides flexibility to the toolchain author in that all required secret names can be prepopulated into a toolchain.yml and then these names are automatically resolved against whatever secrets integrations are configured for the toolchain.\n\nAs previously described, you can configure Secrets Manager to reference secrets by CRN. For more information, see [Cloud Resource Names (CRN)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-crn).

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Depending on the app, to add extra security, you can establish a job that takes down vulnerable containers after they are detected.\n\n\n\nYou can use the built-in container registry to automate the container image build process from your source code in an external source repository to your internal registry. However, images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the internal registry. To set up image scanning, set up a registry namespace and push your images to the managed IBM Cloud Container Registry instead.\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-4546-6910", "score": 0.5982640981674194, "text": "\nTo find out more about the issues, click the link in the Security status column.\n\nThe Vulnerability Advisor dashboard provides an overview and assessment of the security for an image.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret.

When it comes to managing API keys, you want the ability to create your credentials dynamically so that they exist only when you need them to. You also want to lease an API key to someone else on your team and ensure that it is automatically revoked after a time duration that you specify.\n\nWith Secrets Manager, you can create a\n\ndynamic secretthat you can use to access a protected resource, such as deployment logs that you store in a Cloud Object Storage bucket.

Later, a developer wants to access the contents of your storage bucket. The developer sends a request to retrieve the value of your IAM credential.\n4. Secrets Manager validates the request and generates a single-use API key that the developer can use to authenticate to Cloud Object Storage.

To view usage information, users must be invited to the enterprise account and have the Usage Reports Viewer, Editor, or Administrator role on the Enterprise service. The Usage Reports Viewer role provides access only to viewing usage reports, while the Editor and Administrator roles enable additional enterprise management actions. In keeping with security best practices, assign the least amount of access that is needed for the user to complete their task. For more information, see [Enterprise actions and roles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management).\n\nYou can give users granular access so that they can view usage for a certain account or account group.

Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the instance, billed on a per second basis.\n* Does the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark support Hadoop?\n\nNo, currently, the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark only supports Apache Spark.\n* Can I change the instance home storage of a serverless instance?\n\nNo, you can't. After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries. Changing instance home would result in the loss of the Spark history data and custom libraries.\n* How is user management and access control managed in a serverless instance?\n\nUser management and access control of an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance and its APIs is done through IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM). You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges. See [Granting permissions to users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless).\n* How do I define the size of the cluster to run my Spark application?\n\nYou can specify the size of the cluster either at the time the instance is created or when submitting Spark applications.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}]}

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

For example, you can define three different Plans for a single Product. Each Plan can have a different subscription cost and a different rate limit that targets different customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Products \n\nPlans and APIs are grouped in Products.

Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources.\n\nWith Subscription accounts, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For more information about the differences between account types, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota? \n\nWhen you reach any quota for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended.

The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03797-4528-6268", "score": 0.6622517108917236, "text": "\n[A view of the invoices page in the IBM Cloud console.

However, VMs have a performance tradeoff when compared to bare metal specs, such as networking Gbps, RAM and memory thresholds, and storage options. Keep in mind these factors that impact your VM costs.\n\n\n\n* Shared versus dedicated: If you share the underlying hardware of the VM, the cost is less than dedicated hardware, but the physical resources are not dedicated to your VM.\n* Hourly billing only: Hourly billing offers more flexibility to order and cancel VMs quickly. You are charged an hourly rate that is metered for only the time that that the worker node is provisioned. The time is not rounded up or down to the nearest hour, but is metered in minutes and charged at the hourly rate.

The Standard plan is best suited for workloads that have large amount of storage and relatively small Outbound bandwidth (Outbound bandwidth < 20% of Storage capacity). The plan offers flexible choices for storage class based on data access patterns (lower the cost, the less frequently data is accessed). The Standard plan bills for every stored capacity ($/GB/month), Outbound bandwidth ($/GB), class A ($/1,000), class B ($/10,000) and retrieval ($/GB) metrics, where applicable.\n* One Rate plan is suited for active workloads with large amounts of Outbound bandwidth (or varying Outbound bandwidth) as a percent of their Storage capacity (Outbound bandwidth > 20% of Storage capacity). Typical workloads belong to large enterprises and ISVs which may have sub-accounts with multiple divisions/departments or end-users. The plan offers a predictable TCO with an all-inclusive flat monthly charge ($/GB/month) that includes capacity, and built-in allowances for Outbound bandwidth and Operational requests. The built-in allowances for Outbound bandwidth and Operational requests (Class A, Class B) depend on the monthly stored capacity. There is no data retrieval charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How are the allowance thresholds (for Outbound bandwidth, class A and class B) calculated for the One-Rate plan? \n\nFor each of the One-Rate plan pricing regions(North America, Europe, South America,and Asia Pacific), the total aggregated Storage capacity across all instances (within a region) is used to determine the allowance thresholds.\n\n\n\n* Outbound bandwidth: No charge if Outbound bandwidth \u2264 100% of Storage capacity in GB, then list prices apply ($0.05/GBfor North America and Europe, $0.08/GB for South America and Asia Pacific).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-faq-onerate"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03704-7-1987", "score": 0.6359380483627319, "text": "\nFAQs for billing and usage \n\nFAQs for billing and usage might include questions about credit cards, promo codes, or other billing-related issues. To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud\u00ae, see our [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a GB-hour? \n\nRuntime and container usage is charged based on the following variables:\n\n\n\n* How much memory your runtime or container uses, in gigabytes (GB).\n* The duration that memory is used.\n\n\n\nMultiply the two values together, and the result is the GB-hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n How are bandwidth overage charges calculated for Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers? \n\nIBM Cloud systems monitor all inbound and outbound traffic for a server regardless of the type of traffic. Based on the allocated bandwidth for a server, overages are assessed for excess traffic, which is monitored at the network switch level. Monitor your bandwidth usage with bandwidth graphs. For information, see [Viewing bandwidth graphs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-view-bandwidth-graphs).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I prevent bandwidth overages? \n\nIf you provision multiple servers, you can potentially reduce future bandwidth overage charges by pooling your servers' bandwidth.

The set of virtual server instances that you provision to your reserved capacity must be the same size as your reservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Is my payment upfront or monthly? \n\nReserved capacity and instances are purchased for a 1 or 3-year term. After that point, you're committed to a monthly payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What happens at the end of my contract? \n\nDepending on whether you choose hourly or monthly billing, the billing price for the CPU and RAM converts to the current list price, with any account discounts applied.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09887-1649-3273", "score": 0.6623184680938721, "text": "\nA billable queue manager is charged based on the number of Virtual Processor Core (VPC) hours that it is active - for example, a Large size queue manager is charged at four times (4x) the rate of a Small size queue manager.

You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console.

If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03765-2725-4571", "score": 0.6600032448768616, "text": "\n[Actions icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/action-menu-icon.svg) > Set as default.\n2.

Each feature flag must belong to a collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n Properties \n\nProperties are configuration parameters that don't change often, but that still need centralized management. Consolidate properties for all your app and environment components into one central cloud dashboard, with App Configuration, thus avoiding the hassle of managing multiple parameter files.

Each group is called a segment. Members of a segment share one or more common attributes as defined by a set of segment rules. Segments are optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n Attribute \n\nAn attribute is a parameter that is used to define a segment. Attributes are used to create segment rules on the App Configuration dashboard, but names of the attributes and values of each attribute are defined in your code.
