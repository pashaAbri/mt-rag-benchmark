The older population is declining over time due to a shorter life expectancy of sixty years . However , there are still more females than males in these ranges since women have a longer life expectancy .

Populations with a big base , young population , or a big top , an older population , shows that there is a higher dependency ratio .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 .

The more `` recent '' argument of a `` moral shift '' ( the basis of the previous lines of this article ) is described by Hardt and Negri as an `` ideological '' apparatus in order to eliminate the sentiment of guilt in western society . Although moral arguments did play a secondary role , they usually had major resonance when used as a strategy to undercut competitors ' profits . This argument holds that Eurocentric history has been blind to the most important element in this fight for emancipation , precisely , the constant revolt and the antagonism of slaves ' revolts .

Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones .

This is essentially what happened in the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal . There was a concerned client -- in this case , an Indian casino -- worried about possible ill - effects of legislation on its gambling business ; and there were lobbyists such as Jack Abramoff who knew how to exploit these fears . The lobbyists actively lobbied against their own casino - client as a way to ratchet up their fears of adverse legislation as well as stoke possible future contributions ; the lobbyists committed other violations such as grossly overbilling their clients as well as violating rules about giving gifts to congresspersons . Numerous persons went to jail after the scandal . The following are factors which can make fraud a fairly easy - to - do activity : that lobbyists are paid only to try to influence decision - makers , and may or may not succeed , making it hard to tell if a lobbyist did actual work ; that much of what happens regarding interpersonal relations is obscure despite rather strict disclosure and transparency requirements ; that there are sizable monies involved -- factors such as these almost guarantee that there will be future scandals involving fraudulent lobbying activity , according to one assessment . A fraud similar to Abramoff 's was perpetrated in Maryland by lobbyist Gerard E.

This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent .

One alteration concerned politeness ; Wright noted that while Austen 's work had characters waiting before speaking , he believed that `` particularly in big families of girls , everyone tends to speak over each other , finishing each other 's sentences , etc . So I felt that the Bennet family 's conversations would be overlapping like that .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Research is being conducted in an attempt to discover what kinds of nutritional choices result in better sleep quality . A study in the Western Journal of Nursing Research in 2011 compared how sleep quality was affected by four different diets : a high - protein diet , a high - fat diet , a high - carbohydrate diet , and a control diet . Results indicated that the diets high in protein resulted in fewer wakeful episodes during night - time sleep . The high carbohydrate diet was linked to much shorter periods of quiescent or restful sleep . These results suggest that ingested nutrients do play a role in determining sleep quality . Another investigation published in Nutrition Research in 2012 examined the effects of various combinations of dietary choices in regard to sleep . Although it is difficult to determine one perfect diet for sleep enhancement , this study indicated that a variety of micro and macro nutrients are needed to maintain levels of healthful and restful sleep .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

While Toby is mainly a passive victim to Micheal 's abuse who tries his best to remain calm , Toby himself has shown on a few occasions in the series that he enjoys seeing Michael in misery such as when he injures his foot and collapses and struggles in the restroom ( where Michael is disgusted by the idea of Toby helping him instead of Ryan , and Toby gets to mock Michael 's wimpiness and notes with disdain `` you only grilled your foot '' ) and when Toby viciously beats Michael in a game of poker , in which he says he will chase the feeling of taking Michael 's money . Toby has also laughed at Michael 's misfortune on occasion such as in `` The Deposition '' when Toby learns that Michael thinks Ryan is hot and also in `` Koi Pond '' when he learns Michael has fallen into two fountains . Toby once even instructed Pam on how to hit Michael harder after he gave her the opportunity to do so for dating and dumping her mother , showing that he enjoys seeing Michael suffer to a degree . Toby has on occasion stood up to Michael such as in `` Classy Christmas '' when Michael tries to accuse Toby of destroying Holly 's beloved Woody doll to which Toby immediately responds that the vandalism is something that Michael would do , to which everyone agrees . Toby seems to have a strong ability to absorb Michael 's abuse as seen in `` Goodbye Toby '' where he is given a potential opportunity to complain about Michael 's antics and after Michael threatens to kill him ( though he does so in a situation where Holly and Pam would be able to listen to Toby 's issues if he wanted to present them , as they either do n't know how awful Michael has been to him or , in Pam 's case , know it very well ) , Toby claims that everything in the office is fine , and later shrugs to the camera that he has survived Michael 's abuse long enough and that disclosing it is pointless .", "title": "Toby Flenderson", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "822159927_17294-18081-0-787", "score": 0.7462297081947327, "text": "Toby Flenderson\nIn `` Goodbye , Michael , '' when Michael wants to give everyone in the office a proper goodbye , he somewhat makes up for all the times he has berated and insulted Toby by listening to him without insulting him once , possibly showing that he will miss Toby somewhat .

This can be viewed as Michael 's final comeuppance for his treatment of Toby as even though he is moving away to Colorado , he will still not escape Toby and will have to endure annoyance from Toby 's brother Rory ( who seems to be virtually identical to him and whom Toby encourages to be friends with Michael ) .", "title": "Toby Flenderson", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "822159927_56012-56549-0-537", "score": 0.7443640232086182, "text": "Toby Flenderson\nIn the episode `` Koi Pond '' , Toby is present in the meeting where Michael wants to talk about insults in the office and as usual when Toby simply makes a point Michael insults him by calling him a waste of life , though corrects himself claiming that 's what he would like to say but the meeting is an insult free zone .

'' When Andy hosts a motivational exercise involving a tightrope , he insults Toby and Nellie in front of the staff . Since that time , Andy has been rude towards Toby in a manner that echoes Michael Scott 's hatred of his harmless HR rep , though Toby seems much less affected by Andy 's behavior than he was by Michael 's . When Andy went off on his long boat trip , Toby 's time in the last season was devoted to his unrequited romantic interest in Nellie Bertram and his belief that he 'd convicted an innocent man during his jury time on the Scranton Strangler case ( a theory he put to rest when he went to visit the convict in prison and was , in fact , strangled and nearly killed by him ) . In the series finale , it 's revealed that Toby was fired immediately after Dwight fired Kevin Malone ( it 's likely that the Corporate office fired Toby and Dwight simply had the burden of telling him ) and Toby then moved to New York where he 's trying to become a novelist and has six roommates .

If the overall level of debt is rising each year , then aggregate demand exceeds Income by that amount . However , if the level of debt stops rising and instead starts falling ( if `` the bubble bursts '' ) , then aggregate demand falls short of income , by the amount of net savings ( largely in the form of debt repayment or debt writing off , such as in bankruptcy ) . This causes a sudden and sustained drop in aggregate demand , and this shock is argued to be the proximate cause of a class of economic crises , properly financial crises . Indeed , a fall in the level of debt is not necessary -- even a slowing in the rate of debt growth causes a drop in aggregate demand ( relative to the higher borrowing year ) .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

On the giant 's return from seven years visiting his friend the Cornish Ogre , he takes offence at the children and builds a wall to keep them out . He put a notice board `` TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED '' . The garden falls into perpetual winter . One day , the giant is awakened by a linnet , and discovers that spring has returned to the garden , as the children have found a way in through a gap in the wall . He sees the error of his ways , and resolves to destroy the wall . However , when he emerges from his castle , all the children run away except for one boy who was trying to climb a tree . The giant helps this boy into the tree and announces : `` It is your garden now , little children , '' and knocks down the wall . The children once more play in the garden , and spring returns . But the boy that the Giant helped does not return and the Giant is heartbroken . Many years later after happily playing with the children all the time , the Giant is old and feeble . One winter morning , he awakes to see the trees in one part of his garden in full blossom . He descends from the castle to discover the boy that he once helped lying beneath a beautiful white tree that the Giant has never seen before . The Giant sees that the boy bears the stigmata . He does not realise that the boy is actually the Christ Child and is furious that somebody has wounded him .", "title": "The Happy Prince and Other Tales", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Indeed , there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment .

In addition to these results , improvements of memory , and information - processing speed , as well as slight improvements of sensorimotor speed were observed , which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance . However , while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency , the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency .

However , high - dose supplementation of pregnant women should be avoided because it can cause miscarriage and birth defects . Food fortification is also useful for improving VAD . A variety of oily and dry forms of the retinol esters , retinyl acetates and retinyl palmitate are available for food fortification of vitamin A.

Beta - carotene and retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate are used as a form of vitamin A for vitamin A fortification of fat - based foods . Fortification of sugar with retinyl palmitate as a form of vitamin A has been used extensively throughout Central America .

However , caution is needed in interpreting such findings , because of the problems of extreme spatial heterogeneity , and the need to compare samples from equivalent water masses , which is to say that , if an examination of the same parcel of water a week apart is conducted , an order of magnitude change in plastic concentration could be observed .", "title": "Great Pacific garbage patch", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836420850_37166-37772-0-606", "score": 0.5484791994094849, "text": "Godavari River\nHigh alkalinity water is discharged from the ash dump areas of many coal fired power stations into the river which further increases the alkalinity of the river water whose water is naturally of high alkalinity since the river basin is draining vast area of basalt formations .

A contract 's terms are what was promised . Yet it is up to the courts to construe evidence of what the parties said before a contract 's conclusion , and construe the terms agreed . Construction of the contract starts with the express promises people make to one another , but also with terms found in other documents or notices that were intended to be incorporated . The general rule is that reasonable notice of the term is needed , and more notice is needed for an onerous term . The meaning of those terms must then be interpreted , and the modern approach is to construe the meaning of an agreement from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the whole context . The courts , as well as legislation , may also imply terms into contracts generally to ' fill gaps ' as necessary to fulfil the reasonable expectations of the parties , or as necessary incidents to specific contracts . English law had , particularly in the late 19th century , adhered to the laissez faire principle of `` freedom of contract '' so that , in the general law of contract , people can agree to whatever terms or conditions they choose . By contrast , specific contracts , particularly for consumers , employees or tenants were built to carry a minimum core of rights , mostly deriving from statute , that aim to secure the fairness of contractual terms . The evolution of case law in the 20th century generally shows an ever - clearer distinction between general contracts among commercial parties and those between parties of unequal bargaining power , since in these groups of transaction true choice is thought to be hampered by lack of real competition in the market . Hence , some terms can be found to be unfair under statutes such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 or the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 and can be removed by the courts , with the administrative assistance of the Competition and Markets Authority .", "title": "English contract law", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "797649934_20601-20968-0-367", "score": 0.518467128276825, "text": "Social exchange theory\nA generalized exchange involves indirect reciprocity between three or more individuals .

This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .", "title": "Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846282869_1580-2418-0-838", "score": 0.6069176197052002, "text": "Great Wall of China\nThe Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone , brick , tamped earth , wood , and other materials , generally built along an east - to - west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe with an eye to expansion .

Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them .

However , the episode nearly went unwritten because , at the time , few Friends writers were expecting the couple 's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became . The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows ; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple 's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive `` he 's pining , she 's oblivious '' pattern , using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel . Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high , `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' became Friends ' most reworked episode . The couple 's first kiss at the end of season two 's `` The One Where Ross Finds Out '' was met with deafening applause from the studio audience . Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging . Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by `` dangl ( ing ) the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together .

Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) .

Pope Urban II , more prudent than Gregory sidestepped the issue using a Crusade to gather Christian Europe together under his authority . A compromise was reached in Worms in 1122 , by which the emperor abandoned investiture `` by ring and staff '' to the pope , and promised to respect the freedom of elections and consecrations , but kept for himself the right to invest bishops with the temporalities of their sees `` by scepter '' . Though the Emperor retained some power over imperial churches , his power was damaged irreparably because he lost the religious authority that previously belonged to the office of the king . In France , England , and the Christian state in Spain , the king could overcome rebellions of his magnates and establish the power of his royal demesne because he could rely on the Church , which , for several centuries , had given him a mystical authority .

Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China .

Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market .
