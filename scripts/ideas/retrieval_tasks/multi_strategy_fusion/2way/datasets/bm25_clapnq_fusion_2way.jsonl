This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

However , high - dose supplementation of pregnant women should be avoided because it can cause miscarriage and birth defects . Food fortification is also useful for improving VAD . A variety of oily and dry forms of the retinol esters , retinyl acetates and retinyl palmitate are available for food fortification of vitamin A. Margarine and oil are the ideal food vehicles for vitamin A fortification . They protect vitamin A from oxidation during storage and prompt absorption of vitamin A. Beta - carotene and retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate are used as a form of vitamin A for vitamin A fortification of fat - based foods . Fortification of sugar with retinyl palmitate as a form of vitamin A has been used extensively throughout Central America . Cereal flours , milk powder , and liquid milk are also used as food vehicles for vitamin A fortification . Genetic engineering is another method of food fortification , and this has been achieved with golden rice , but opposition to genetically modified foods has prevented its use as of July 2012 . Dietary diversification can also control VAD . Non-animal sources of vitamin A which contain pre-formed vitamin A account for greater than 80 % of intake for most individuals in the developing world . The increase in consumption of vitamin A-rich foods of animal origin in addition to fruits and vegetables has beneficial effects on VAD . Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service have been able to identify genetic sequences in corn that are associated with higher levels of beta - carotene , the precursor to vitamin A. They found that breeders can cross certain variations of corn to produce a crop with an 18-fold increase in beta - carotene .

Diana goes with Steve to take part in the War , and he acts as her guide into the world outside of Themyscira and how mankind functions .

After the signing of the Gandhi -- Irwin Pact , Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi -- here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties .

During this term of imprisonment , Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other , and the two developed a close bond of affection , trust , and frankness .

Even today he is remembered as the man who united India . He is , in this regard , compared to Otto von Bismarck of Germany , who did the same thing in the 1860s . Under the plan of 3 June , more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan , or choosing independence . Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede , most of the people and territory would be fragmented . The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion . Gandhi had said to Patel , `` ( T ) he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it '' . Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task . He asked V. P. Menon , a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India , to become his right - hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry . On 6 May 1947 , Patel began lobbying the princes , attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts . Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs , inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi . At these meetings , Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order . Patel invoked the patriotism of India 's monarchs , asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people . He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic , especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects . He proposed favourable terms for the merger , including the creation of privy purses for the rulers ' descendants . While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism , Patel did not rule out force . Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith , he set a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

Romeo and Juliet is not considered to be exceedingly psychologically complex , and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses . Norman Holland , writing in 1966 , considers Romeo 's dream as a realistic `` wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of Romeo 's adult world and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral , phallic and oedipal '' -- while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of the author . Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other . That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers ' language : Juliet , for example , speaks of `` my only love sprung from my only hate '' and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo 's death . This leads on to speculation as to the playwright 's psychology , in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare 's grief for the death of his son , Hamnet .", "title": "Romeo and Juliet", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass ( dynamic mutations ) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat . This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations , such that an unaffected parent with an `` intermediate '' number of repeats ( 28 -- 35 ) , or `` reduced penetrance '' ( 36 -- 40 ) , may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD . Such increases in the number of repeats ( and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease ) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation . Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis ; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length , whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length .

Over this period , the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India , importing these from Britain 's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations , while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms , and of agricultural exports from India . Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade . In London , the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India , and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

The difference in neuroticism was the most prominent and consistent , with significant differences found in 49 of the 55 nations surveyed . Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous , healthy , and more gender - egalitarian cultures . A plausible explanation for this is that acts by women in individualistic , egalitarian countries are more likely to be attributed to their personality , rather than being attributed to ascribed gender roles within collectivist , traditional countries . Differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were due to differences between men , not women , in these respective regions . That is , men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic , extraverted , conscientious and agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions . Women , on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions . The most simple explanation for this gender data is that women remain relatively resource - poor , regardless of the circumstances of males within a first - world country . However , the authors of this study speculated that resource - poor environments ( that is , countries with low levels of development ) may inhibit the development of gender differences , whereas resource - rich environments facilitate them . This may be because males require more resources than females in order to reach their full developmental potential . The authors also argued that due to different evolutionary pressures , men may have evolved to be more risk taking and socially dominant , whereas women evolved to be more cautious and nurturing . Ancient hunter - gatherer societies may have been more egalitarian than later agriculturally oriented societies . Hence , the development of gender inequalities may have acted to constrain the development of gender differences in personality that originally evolved in hunter - gatherer societies . As modern societies have become more egalitarian , again , it may be that innate sex differences are no longer constrained and hence manifest more fully than in less - developed cultures . Currently , this hypothesis remains untested , as gender differences in modern societies have not been compared with those in hunter - gatherer societies .", "title": "Big Five personality traits", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801197945_35186-35556-0-370", "score": 0.016129032258064516, "text": "Egg donation\nThere are also some Christian leaders ( especially Catholic ) who are concerned about all in vitro fertility therapies because they disrupt the natural act of conceiving a child where gamete donations , both egg and sperm donations , are seen to `` compromise the marital bond and family integrity '' . and they encourage infertile couples to consider adoption instead .", "title": "Egg donation", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "827733959_11072-11467-0-395", "score": 0.015873015873015872, "text": "Bipolar junction transistor\nA BJT consists of three differently doped semiconductor regions : the emitter region , the base region and the collector region .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel .

The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows ; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple 's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive `` he 's pining , she 's oblivious '' pattern , using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel . Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high , `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' became Friends ' most reworked episode . The couple 's first kiss at the end of season two 's `` The One Where Ross Finds Out '' was met with deafening applause from the studio audience . Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging . Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by `` dangl ( ing ) the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together . '' According to Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb , Ross and Rachel 's ever - changing relationship `` converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama . '' Meanwhile , writing for The New York Review of Books , Elaine Blair agreed that Friends created `` a sense of chemistry between two characters while also putting obstacles in their way , setting us up for a long - deferred union .

According to this theory , the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power . Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups , such as an individual having superiority over another .

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

In the following year , 214 BC , Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

In the following year , 214 BC , Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north .

In this way , Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe . In addition to rebuilding the walls , archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu 's reign . The fortifications here include embankments , beacon stations , and forts , all constructed with a combination of tamped - earth cores and stone frontages . From the Ordos Loop , the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei , Zhangye , and Jiuquan , leading into the Juyan Lake Basin , and terminating in two places : the Yumen Pass in the north , or the Yang Pass to the south , both in the vicinity of Dunhuang .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

Grates with long narrow slots parallel to traffic flow are of particular concern to cyclists , as the front tire of a bicycle may become stuck , causing the cyclist to go over the handlebars or lose control and fall . Storm drains in streets and parking areas must be strong enough to support the weight of vehicles , and are often made of cast iron or reinforced concrete .

This was preceded by the founding of the Turkish Petroleum Company , which was created with the intention of exploring and extracting oil within the Ottoman Empire . Eventually , after the discovery of a large oil field in Iraq in 1928 , the issue of distribution arose . Each of the large powers -- France , the United Kingdom , and the United States -- worried about being edged out by the other two . The Red Line Agreement was eventually signed , giving the Near East Development Corporation , the Anglo - Persian Oil Company , Royal Dutch / Shell , and the Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles each 23.75 % of any oil that was produced by the Turkish Petroleum Company . The Near East Development Corporation represented American interests and included Jersey Standard Oil , Socony - Vacuum Oil Company , Gulf Oil , the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company , and Atlantic Refining . The remaining 5 % share went to an Armenian businessman , Calouste Gulbenkian , who had previously owned shares within TPC . The more important provision of the Red Line Agreement was that none of the four parties could develop any oilfields from the Suez Canal to the Iran , with the exception of Kuwait ( the area that the TPC had jurisdiction over ) , unless that party gained support and approval from the other three . Thus , the United States broke into the oil market in Iraq and later into the rest of the Middle East . Eventually , due to the aligning of Prime Minister Rashid al - Gilani with Germany , the West , particularly Great Britain , gained open access to Iraq . However , WWII left the UK weakened and unable to retain its dominance in the region , and as such the Truman and Roosevelt administrations were able to achieve their top priority , monopolizing oil in the region .", "title": "History of United States\u2013Middle East economic relations", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "799491879_7857-8351-0-494", "score": 0.015151515151515152, "text": "Attack on Pearl Harbor\nIn 1940 , Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China .

The middle of the third decade , in an effort to counter other networks ' efforts to counterprogram the game , saw the introduction of popular music acts such as New Kids on the Block , Gloria Estefan , Michael Jackson , Clint Black , Patti LaBelle , and Tony Bennett .

Steam power -- the efficiency of steam engines increased so that they used between one - fifth and one - tenth as much fuel . The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses . The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio , making it suitable for transportation . Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800 . Iron making -- the substitution of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production . Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces , resulting in economies of scale . The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760 . It was later improved by making it double acting , which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures . The puddling process produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the finery forge . The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron . Hot blast ( 1828 ) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .

They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses . The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective .

The German word for them is Meerschweinchen , literally `` little sea pig '' , which has been translated into Polish as \u015bwinka morska , into Hungarian as tengerimalac , and into Russian as \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 .

Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) .
