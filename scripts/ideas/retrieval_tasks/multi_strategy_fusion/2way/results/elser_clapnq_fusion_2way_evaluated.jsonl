Studies from 2007 -- 2010 applied molecular markers and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals , thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be Cavia tschudii . Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_12432-13339-0-907","score":0.0322580645,"text":"Guinea pig\nDomesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more ; groups of sows , or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations , but boars can sometimes live together .

A constant supply of hay is generally recommended , as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop bad habits if food is not present , such as chewing on their hair . Because their teeth grow constantly ( as do their nails , like humans ) , they routinely gnaw on things , lest their teeth become too large for their jaw ( a common problem in rodents ) . Guinea pigs chew on cloth , paper , plastic , and rubber , if they are available .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_1090-1588-0-498","score":0.0310096154,"text":"Guinea pig\nThe domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean groups , especially as a food source , but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies .

Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"856541500_5949-6364-0-415","score":0.0151515152,"text":"Bell pepper\nBell peppers contain 94 % water , 5 % carbohydrates , and negligible fat and protein ( table ) .

She did not appear to be angered at this . After an awkward silence , Toby announces his move to Costa Rica . In `` Goodbye , Toby '' Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her ( because she took the picture herself ) for when he leaves for Costa Rica . Toby , unsatisfied by the lack of her presence , shouts at the office staff asking for a camera ( possibly the loudest he 's ever spoken ) . When no one responds , he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together . Pam also helps Toby take revenge against Michael in this episode after his insulting farewell gift is exposed during a meeting and she gets him to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby , which he does ( Pam potentially may have disclosed Michael 's abuse of Toby if he did n't do what she said ) . At the end of the episode , Pam comments ( though not to Toby ) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot . In `` Niagara '' Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding .

During `` Roy 's Wedding '' , while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there 's anything they do n't know about each other , Toby correctly answers facts about Pam . Everyone notices him , and Toby , clearly embarrassed , attempts to cover it up . There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby offered his help and notably in `` Paper Airplane '' after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing ( to which Toby apologizes ) . Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporally blinding Toby . In the series finale , while dancing with Pam , Toby began sobbing . Pam questions Toby with `` Is it me ? Is it Nellie ? '' Toby shakes his head , and responds with `` It 's everything .

Michael then attempts to get Toby fired by giving Pam a fake letter to give to Toby , asking him to hug and kiss her no matter how much she resisted , and taunting the HR rep into punching him , but both plans fail . Michael then tries out Dwight 's idea of planting drugs in Toby 's desk ( unknowingly buying basil from a caprese salad from warehouse workers who he thinks sold him marijuana ) . However , he does feel guilty about what he has done and , when the police are investigating the `` drugs , '' Michael tells the police that it 's a mistake and tries to stop them from arresting Toby .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV . Games use the Accelerometer and Gyroscope along with the touchpad found on the Siri Remote for control . External Bluetooth Game controllers : ( such as the SteelSeries Nimbus , or the HORIPAD ULTIMATE Wireless Gaming Controller ) can also be paired .","title":"Apple TV","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"826429162_12868-17425-3140-4557","score":0.0163934426,"text":"Xbox Live\n( requires Gold membership ) Dailymotion allowing users to access television and movie content ( requires Gold membership and Dailymotion account ) UFC on Xbox Live allows users to view pay - per - view events in 1080p HD , access a library of live and on - demand video content , connect with friends to predict fight results and have the ability to compare fighter statistics and records MLB.tv offering out - of - market Major League Baseball games ( requires Gold membership and MLB.tv subscription ) Live event streaming , including video game announcements , award shows , concerts , sports , beauty pageants and news events ( most events require Gold membership and fees ) Sports Picks allowing users to predict the outcome of sporting events , including UFC , NBA and NHL games , with future support for MLB games and Miss Universe Organization pageants ( requires Gold membership ) Various TV on - demand services which are available to all users ( no Gold subscription required ) , albeit restricted by region .

But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing `` fullest peace '' for having done `` their duty '' . Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British had employed ruthless means of suppression , the Quit India movement was `` by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857 '' , as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill . More than 100,000 people were arrested and many were killed in violent struggles with the police . Strikes , protests , and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India .

Doug McAdam explains the success of the mass mobilization of volunteers for Freedom Summer in terms of `` Biographical Availability '' , where individuals must have a certain degree of social , economic , and psychological freedom to be able to participate in large scale social movements . This explanation can also be applied to the Anti-War Movement because it occurred around the same time and the same biographical factors applied to the college - aged anti-war protesters . David Meyers ( 2007 ) also explains how the concept of personal efficacy affects mass movement mobilization . For example , according to Meyers ' thesis , consider that American wealth increased drastically after World War II . At this time , America was a superpower and enjoyed great affluence after thirty years of depression , war , and sacrifice . Benjamin T. Harrison ( 2000 ) argues that the post World War II affluence set the stage for the protest generation in the 1960s . His central thesis is that the World Wars and Great Depression spawned a ' beat generation ' refusing to conform to mainstream American values which lead to the emergence of the Hippies and the counterculture . The Anti-war movement became part of a larger protest movement against the traditional American Values and attitudes . Meyers ( 2007 ) builds off this claim in his argument that the `` relatively privileged enjoy the education and affirmation that afford them the belief that they might make a difference . '' As a result of the present factors in terms of affluence , biographical availability ( defined in the sociological areas of activism as the lack of restrictions on social relationships of which most likely increases the consequences of participating in a social movement ) , and increasing political atmosphere across the county , political activity increased drastically on college campuses .","title":"Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"843615184_10824-11202-0-378","score":0.0153846154,"text":"Samoa\nThe second major incident arose out of an initially peaceful protest by the Mau ( which literally translates as `` strongly held opinion '' ) , a non-violent popular movement which had its beginnings in the early 1900s on Savai'i , led by Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe , an orator chief deposed by Solf .

At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors , who would act as go - betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm . The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural realm were shamans . Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan ( oracular ) priests . Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies , which are hallucinogenic in high doses . As the Maya civilization developed , the ruling elite codified the general concepts held by Maya society , and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule . In the Late Preclassic , the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king , the k'uhul ajaw . Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief system through archaeology , some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces . These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits , shrines , and burials and their associated funerary offerings .

The Black Death originated in Central Asia and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries .

Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region , where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia . The Mongols had cut off the trade route , the Silk Road , between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe . The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants ' last trading station in the region , Caffa in the Crimea . In late 1346 , plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town . When spring arrived , the Italian merchants fled on their ships , unknowingly carrying the Black Death . Carried by the fleas on rats , the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another .","title":"Bubonic plague","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836809496_59329-60090-0-761","score":0.0149253731,"text":"History of West Africa\nEbola virus disease , first identified in 1976 , typically occurs in outbreaks in tropical regions of Sub-Saharan Africa , including West Africa .

After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur . Based on population genetic models , Galvani and Slatkin ( 2003 ) argue that the intermittent nature of plague epidemics did not generate a sufficiently strong selective force to drive the allele frequency of CCR5 \u039432 to 10 % in Europe .","title":"CCR5","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"855533381_10785-11590-0-805","score":0.0305361305,"text":"Virus\nThe second half of the 20th century was the golden age of virus discovery and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal , plant , and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays . Some of Shakespeare 's plays , particularly the history plays , were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto ( i.e. pamphlet ) form ; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition .","title":"Shakespeare's reputation","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"840297813_30551-31009-0-458","score":0.0322580645,"text":"Shakespeare's reputation\nClearly there were some exceptions to the official approval of Shakespeare , and the great patriotic plays , most notably Henry V were shelved .

Performances in the 19th century , including Charlotte Cushman 's , restored the original text and focused on greater realism . John Gielgud 's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare 's text and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama . In the 20th and into the 21st century , the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor 's 1935 film Romeo and Juliet , Franco Zeffirelli 's 1968 version Romeo and Juliet , and Baz Luhrmann 's 1996 MTV - inspired Romeo + Juliet .","title":"Romeo and Juliet","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"806376271_12542-13384-0-842","score":0.0158730159,"text":"Romeo and Juliet\nDa Porto gave Romeo and Juliet most of its modern form , including the names of the lovers , the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti , and the location in Verona .

Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other .

The resource hypothesis , for example , was meant to explain the trade - off between maintenance and processing : The more information must be maintained in working memory , the slower and more error prone concurrent processes become , and with a higher demand on concurrent processing memory suffers . This trade - off has been investigated by tasks like the reading - span task described above . It has been found that the amount of trade - off depends on the similarity of the information to be remembered and the information to be processed . For example , remembering numbers while processing spatial information , or remembering spatial information while processing numbers , impair each other much less than when material of the same kind must be remembered and processed . Also , remembering words and processing digits , or remembering digits and processing words , is easier than remembering and processing materials of the same category . These findings are also difficult to explain for the decay hypothesis , because decay of memory representations should depend only on how long the processing task delays rehearsal or recall , not on the content of the processing task . A further problem for the decay hypothesis comes from experiments in which the recall of a list of letters was delayed , either by instructing participants to recall at a slower pace , or by instructing them to say an irrelevant word once or three times in between recall of each letter . Delaying recall had virtually no effect on recall accuracy . The interference theory seems to fare best with explaining why the similarity between memory contents and the contents of concurrent processing tasks affects how much they impair each other .

CAG is the 3 - letter genetic code ( codon ) for the amino acid glutamine , so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a polyglutamine tract ( or polyQ tract ) , and the repeated part of the gene , the PolyQ region .","title":"Huntington's disease","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834242094_3560-4384-0-824","score":0.0289855072,"text":"Huntington's disease\nThe first likely description of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters .

Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China . However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate . The average size of land holdings is very small , with 70 % of holdings being less than one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) in size . Irrigation facilities are inadequate , as revealed by the fact that only 46 % of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016 , resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall , specifically the monsoon season , which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit . These inputs were easily available in at least parts of the states of Punjab , Haryana , and western Uttar Pradesh ; thus , yields increased most in these states .","title":"Green Revolution in India","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846588693_3711-4082-0-371","score":0.029877369,"text":"Green Revolution in India\nThe production of wheat has produced the best results in fueling self - sufficiency of India .

Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China . However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate . The average size of land holdings is very small , with 70 % of holdings being less than one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) in size . Irrigation facilities are inadequate , as revealed by the fact that only 46 % of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016 , resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall , specifically the monsoon season , which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country . In an effort to bring an additional two crore hectares ( 20 million hectares ; 50 million acres ) of land under irrigation , various schemes have been attempted , including the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme ( AIBP ) which was provided \u20b9 80,000 crore ( \u20b9 800 billion ) in the union budget .

Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted .

In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom .

Gerson therapy : A form of alternative medicine , the diet is low salt , low fat and vegetarian , and also involves taking specific supplements . It was developed by Max Gerson , who claimed the therapy could cure cancer and chronic , degenerative diseases . These claims have not been scientifically proven , and the American Cancer Society claims that elements of the therapy have caused serious illness and death . The Graham Diet : A vegetarian diet which promotes whole - wheat flour and discourages the consumption of stimulants such as alcohol and caffeine . Developed by Sylvester Graham in the 19th century . Hay diet : A food - combining diet developed by William Howard Hay in the 1920s . Divides foods into separate groups , and suggests that proteins and carbohydrates should not be consumed in the same meal . High - protein diet : A diet in which high quantities of protein are consumed with the intention of building muscle . Not to be confused with low - carb diets , where the intention is to lose weight by restricting carbohydrates . High residue diet : A diet in which high quantities of dietary fiber are consumed . High - fiber foods include certain fruits , vegetables , nuts and grains .

About 92 out of 100 couples who are trying to get pregnant do so within two years . Women become less fertile as they get older .

This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ? ' '' However , the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends , which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston 's busy film schedule .","title":"Rachel Green","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6508205186,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6508205186}}

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_28455-29218-0-763","score":0.0303030303,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nAs Northern Wei became more economically dependent on agriculture , the Xianbei emperors made a conscious decision to adopt Chinese customs , including passive methods of frontier defence .

Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling . The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin ; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls , such as those in Gubeikou , often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them . The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass : instead of laying siege , the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates . In 1215 , Genghis Khan besieged , captured , and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing ( modern - day Beijing ) . The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234 .

More positions were set up in the years up Hongwu 's death in 1398 , and watchtowers were manned from the Bohai Sea to Beijing and further onto the Mongolian steppes . These positions , however , were not for a linear defence but rather a regional one in which walls did not feature heavily , and offensive tactics remained the overarching policy at the time . In 1421 , the Ming capital was relocated from Nanjing in the south to Beijing in the north , partly to better manage the Mongol situation . Thus defenses were concentrated around Beijing , where stone and earth began to replace rammed earth in strategic passes . A wall was erected by the Ming in Liaodong to protect Han settlers from a possible threat from the Jurched - Mongol Oriyanghan around 1442 .

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today .

In the north , the state of Wei and the Yiqu built walls to protect themselves from Qin aggression , but were still unable to stop Qin from eating into their territories . The Qin reformist Shang Yang forced the Wei out of their walled area west of the Yellow River in 340 BC , and King Huiwen of Qin ( r . 338 -- 311 BC ) took 25 Yiqu forts in a northern offensive . When King Huiwen died , his widow the Queen Dowager Xuan acted as regent because the succeeding sons were deemed too young to govern . During the reign of King Zhaoxiang ( r . 306 -- 251 BC ) , the queen dowager apparently entered illicit relations with the Yiqu king and gave birth to two of his sons , but later tricked and killed the Yiqu king . Following that coup , the Qin army marched into Yiqu territory at the queen dowager 's orders ; the Qin annihilated the Yiqu remnants and thus came to possess the Ordos region . At this point the Qin built a wall around their new territories to defend against the true nomads even further north , incorporating the Wei walls .

These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

In this way , Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe . In addition to rebuilding the walls , archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu 's reign . The fortifications here include embankments , beacon stations , and forts , all constructed with a combination of tamped - earth cores and stone frontages . From the Ordos Loop , the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei , Zhangye , and Jiuquan , leading into the Juyan Lake Basin , and terminating in two places : the Yumen Pass in the north , or the Yang Pass to the south , both in the vicinity of Dunhuang . Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications -- further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass , about 460 kilometres ( 290 mi ) to the east .

This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 , which provided for comprehensive planning , technical services , research , and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure . The Act was amended in 1965 , establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so . Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s , in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns . In 1970 EPA was created by the Richard Nixon administration , and authority for managing various environmental programs was transferred to the new agency . In 1972 , Congress passed the Clean Water Act , requiring industrial plants and municipal sewage plants to proactively improve their waste treatment practices in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources . In 1974 , the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems . This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed . From then on , drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal , state , and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations . The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion in research and construction grants for municipal sewage treatment . The funds initially provided an incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure for municipalities , instead of decentralized systems . However , the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems , and financial assistance was made available for such alternatives . In the mid-1990s decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population , and approximately 37 percent of new housing developments .","title":"Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834226571_364-764-0-400","score":0.0298573975,"text":"Storm drain\nA storm drain , storm sewer ( U.S. and Canada ) , surface water drain \/ sewer ( United Kingdom ) , or stormwater drain ( Australia and New Zealand ) is designed to drain excess rain and ground water from impervious surfaces such as paved streets , car parks , parking lots , footpaths , sidewalks , and roofs .

The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth , and the west was considered the place of death , as the god Ra , the Sun , underwent birth , death , and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky .

The need for irrigation led the Sumerians , and later the Akkadians , to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers . Major cities , such as Ur and Uruk , took root on tributaries of the Euphrates , while others , notably Lagash , were built on branches of the Tigris . The rivers provided the further benefits of fish ( used both for food and fertilizer ) , reeds , and clay ( for building materials ) . With irrigation , the food supply in Mesopotamia was compabale to the Canadian prairies . The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the Fertile Crescent , which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile . Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops , portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable . This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia . Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts . Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley , onions , grapes , turnips , and apples . Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine . As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian , farmers did not depend on slaves to complete farm work for them , but there were some exceptions . There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical ( i.e. the escape \/ mutiny of the slave ) . Although the rivers sustained life , they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities . The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers ; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept . Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils , leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad , further north .","title":"Mesopotamia","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"808202938_11387-12015-0-628","score":0.0307765152,"text":"History of agriculture\nThe civilization of Ancient Egypt was indebted to the Nile River and its dependable seasonal flooding .

The metaphor of a `` lifeline '' suggested that Manchuria was crucial to the functioning of the Japanese economy , which explains why the conquest of Manchuria was so popular and why afterwards Japanese public opinion was so hostile towards any suggestion of letting Manchuria go . At the time , censorship in Japan was nowhere near as stringent as it later became , and Young noted : `` Had they wished , it would have been possible in 1931 and 1932 for journalists and editors to express anti-war sentiments '' . The liberal journal Kaiz\u014d criticized the war with the journalist Got\u014d Shinobu in the November 1931 edition accusing the Kwangtung Army of a `` two-fold coup d'\u00e9tat '' against both the government in Tokyo and against the government of China .

Such was the extent of `` war fever '' in Japan in 1931 that even Akiko succumbed , writing a poem in 1932 praising bushid\u014d , urging the Kwantung Army to `` smash the sissified dreams of compromise '' and declared that to die for the Emperor in battle was the most `` purest '' act a Japanese man could perform .","title":"Japanese invasion of Manchuria","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836237489_7124-7992-0-868","score":0.0153846154,"text":"Third World\nBy the end of the 1960s , the idea of the Third World came to represent countries in Africa , Asia and Latin America that were considered underdeveloped by the West based on a variety of characteristics ( low economic development , low life expectancy , high rates of poverty and disease , etc . ) .

With the war in Europe occupying the attention of the major colonial powers , Japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the Dutch East Indies , French Indochina , and British Malaya .

Focused on domestic policy , Roosevelt largely acquiesced to Congress 's non-interventionist policies in the early - to - mid 1930s . In the interim , Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia , and the Italians joined Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in supporting General Francisco Franco and the Nationalist cause in the Spanish Civil War . As that conflict drew to a close in early 1939 , Roosevelt expressed regret in not aiding the Spanish Republicans . When Japan invaded China in 1937 , isolationism limited Roosevelt 's ability to aid China , despite atrocities like the Nanking Massacre and the USS Panay incident . The","title":"Franklin D.

At a wedding reception , the father of the bride , in his role as host , regularly offers the first toast , thanking the guests for attending , offering tasteful remembrances of the bride 's childhood , and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together . The best man usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds . A best man 's toast takes the form of a short speech ( 3 -- 5 minutes ) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity . The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom 's expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom , amongst others . The actual `` toast '' is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy , healthy , loving life together . The maid of honor may follow suit , appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride . The groom may offer the final toast , thanking the bride 's parents for hosting the wedding , the wedding party for their participation , and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids .","title":"Toast (honor)","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834188205_42701-43467-0-766","score":0.0163934426,"text":"Defense of Marriage Act\nAlthough individual members of Congress have every right to express their views and the views of their constituents with respect to their religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom , this court can not conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views , legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day .

Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies , particularly in Haiti , but Haitian cotton production was halted by the Haitian Revolution in 1791 . The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable , leading to widespread growth of cotton plantations in the United States and Brazil . ( A strain of cotton seed brought to Natchez in 1806 , Gossypium hirsutum , would become the parent genetic material for over 90 % of world cotton production to come : it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to pick . ) The Americas , particularly the U.S. , had labor shortages and high priced labor , which made slavery attractive . America 's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable , and able to keep up with demand . The U.S. Civil war created a `` cotton famine '' that lead to increased production in other areas of the world , including new colonies in Africa .","title":"Industrial Revolution","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801059786_12890-13145-0-255","score":0.0307692308,"text":"United Kingdom and the American Civil War\nBritain 's shortage of cotton was partially made up by imports from India and Egypt by 1863 .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_8563-10133-0-1570","score":0.0292110874,"text":"Guinea pig\nSpanish , Dutch , and English traders brought guinea pigs to Europe , where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty , including Queen Elizabeth I .

One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea , leading people to think they had originated there . `` Guinea '' was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far - off , unknown country , so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal 's exotic appeal . Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America . A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 . Others believe `` guinea '' may be an alteration of the word coney ( rabbit ) ; guinea pigs were referred to as `` pig coneys '' in Edward Topsell 's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_4356-5985-0-1580","score":0.0322580645,"text":"Guinea pig\nThe animal 's name alludes to pigs in many European languages . The German word for them is Meerschweinchen , literally `` little sea pig '' , which has been translated into Polish as \u015bwinka morska , into Hungarian as tengerimalac , and into Russian as \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 . This derives from the Middle High German name merswin . This originally meant `` dolphin '' and was used because of the animals ' grunting sounds ( which were thought to be similar ) . Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_3168-3898-0-728","score":0.0317460317,"text":"Guinea pig\nThe scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus , with porcellus being Latin for `` little pig '' .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_588-1089-0-501","score":0.0303030303,"text":"Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also known as cavy or domestic cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia .

Using the same techniques , they calculated the length of the Nile as 6,853 kilometres ( 4,258 mi ) , which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon . They made it possible by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of Canal do Sul and then , after a sharp turn back , following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the R\u00edo Par\u00e1 bay in its entire length . Guido Gelli , director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE ) , told the Brazilian TV network Globo in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world . However , other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001 , and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these Brazilian scientists .

Ships were the fastest vehicles at the time , as trains and automobiles were still being developed . In order to facilitate shipping throughout the country 's interior , numerous canals were constructed between internal bodies of water in the 1800s . One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal , built to link the Midwest to the Port of New York , a significant seaport during that time . The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West , allowing settlers to travel west , send goods to markets in frontier cities , and export goods via the Hudson River and New York City . The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation , surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts . After the completion of the Erie Canal , smaller canals were built to connect it with the new system . The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain . This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway , and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City . Another major canal was the Oswego Canal , which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario , and could be used to bypass Niagara Falls . The Cayuga - Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake . Farther south , the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale , Pennsylvania , and the Hudson River at Kingston , New York . This canal enabled the transportation of coal , and later other goods as well , between the Delaware and Hudson River watersheds .

The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end - of - season World Championship Game between the two league champions ( later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game ) . Still another city received an NFL franchise thanks to the AFL , as New Orleans was awarded an NFL team after Louisiana 's federal Congressmen pushed for the passage of Public Law 89 - 800 , which permitted the merger and exempted the action from Anti-Trust restrictions . The monopoly that would be created needed to be legitimized by an act of Congress . In 1970 , the leagues fully merged under the name National Football League and divided into two conferences of an equal number of teams . Since the pre-merger NFL had six more teams than the AFL , three NFL teams -- the Pittsburgh Steelers , Cleveland Browns , and Baltimore Colts -- moved to the AFC , the conference containing the AFL teams . Two other teams , the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers , were also added to the NFL as part of the merger agreement . ( These two teams were not added until 1976 ; during the early 1970s , there were some concerns that several of the newly transplanted teams did not have stadiums big or modern enough to accommodate the NFL , and Seattle and Tampa Bay unsuccessfully attempted to court teams such as the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots to their cities .

The game of hockey , though much in vogue on the ice in New England and other parts of the United States , is not much known here , and in consequence the game of last evening was looked forward to with great interest . Hockey is played usually with a ball , but last night , in order that no accident should happen , a flat block of wood was used , so that it should slide along the ice without rising , and thus going among the spectators to their discomfort . The game is like Lacrosse in one sense -- the block having to go through flags placed about 8 feet apart in the same manner as the rubber ball -- but in the main the old country game of shinty gives the best idea of hockey . The players last night were eighteen in number -- nine on each side -- and were as follows : -- Messrs. Torrance ( captain ) , Meagher , Potter , Goff , Barnston , Gardner , Griffin , Jarvis and Whiting . Creighton ( captain ) , Campbell , Campbell , Esdaile , Joseph , Henshaw , Chapman , Powell and Clouston . The match was an interesting and well - contested affair , the efforts of the players exciting much merriment as they wheeled and dodged each other , and notwithstanding the brilliant play of Captain Torrance 's team Captain Creighton 's men carried the day , winning two games to the single of the Torrance nine . The game was concluded about half - past nine , and the spectators then adjourned well satisfied with the evening 's entertainment .","title":"First indoor ice hockey game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"842006194_20465-20709-0-244","score":0.0163934426,"text":"Pete Maravich\nDespite some setbacks coping with their father 's death and without the benefit that his tutelage might have provided , both sons eventually were inspired to play high school and collegiate basketball -- Josh at his father 's alma mater , LSU .","title":"Pete Maravich","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"804380142_5874-6507-0-633","score":0.0161290323,"text":"Stanley Cup\nStanley 's entire family became active in ice hockey .
