A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces.

By default, the monitoring agent automatically discovers and collects data from a select group of events. You can edit the agent configuration file to enable more events.\n* Custom events that you configure through any of the following integrations: Slackbot, pre-built Python scripts, custom user-created Python scripts, or cURL requests.\n\n\n\nBy default, an event has a state:\n\n\n\n* Active: This state indicates that the circumstances that triggered the event remain in place, for example, a node continues to be down.\n* OK: This state indicates that the situation is back to normal, for example, a node is up and running.\n\n\n\nYou manage events in the Events section of the web UI.\n\n\n\n* You can view alert events through the Alert Events tab.\n* You can view infrastructure-based events through the Custom events tab.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/monitoring?topic=monitoring-alerts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09414-2945-4767","score":0.0303099885,"text":"\nFor example, you might want to be notified if the number of actions that fail are greater than a threshold that you specify.\n\nThrough the IBM Log Analysis web UI, you can apply search queries to define the logs that are displayed through a custom view.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13493-7-1679","score":0.0305503731,"text":"\nRunning a query \n\nWatch the following video to learn more about Data Engine and how you can get started to run a basic query.\n\nIn SQL, the term query is just another way of saying SELECT statement.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07175-1564-2340","score":0.0322580645,"text":"\nFor more about training requirements and options, see [Improving result relevance with the tooling](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-tooling).\n\n\n\n\n\n Query overview \n\nThe Query overview section displays:\n\n\n\n* The total number of queries made by users\n* The percentage of queries with one or more results clicked\n* The percentage of queries with no results clicked\n* The percentage of queries with no results returned\n* A graph that displays these results over time, so that you can track how adding more data and relevancy training are improving performance\n\n\n\nThese results are gathered using the Events and Feedback API.

For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00460-34449-36370","score":0.0471626734,"text":"\nQuery (_find endpoint) improved\n: IBM Cloudant Query now uses a new method to select an index.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.25,"recall_3":0.25,"recall_5":0.25,"recall_10":0.75,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.39038005,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6207412961}}

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time.

In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.0476190476,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04175-0-1274","score":0.046875,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question.

If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts.

VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift overview \n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform is a platform that is designed to orchestrate containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network. It also hosts a webserver to help the build process of the cluster.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-openshift-runbook-runbook-intro"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-396975-399135","score":0.0314980159,"text":"\nWith Kubernetes, you can combine various resources such as secrets, deployments, and services to securely create and manage highly available, containerized apps.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift\n: Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is a Kubernetes-based platform that is designed especially to accelerate your containerized app delivery processes that run on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system.

This offering uses open source, Terraform-based automation to provision and configure IBM Cloud VPC resources that make up the cluster. It deploys the worker nodes in all three zones for the region that you select. With simple steps to define configuration properties and use automated deployment, you can build your own HPC cluster in minutes. In addition, the automation deploys an extra virtual server instance (shown as the Login Node in the architecture diagram) so you can easily build and assemble applications for your cluster right away.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift for HPC enables three interfaces: UI, API, and CLI. The UI involves use of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Cloud\/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation. Any updates that are needed post-deployment regarding Red Hat OpenShift configuration or setup should be performed by using Red Hat OpenShift tools and commands. If you use the Schematics interface to make changes to configuration properties and reapply those changes, you can cause disruptions to the running Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

Anyone who does not have an exact copy of the key will be unable to open the mailbox and see it's contents. When your colleague uses the key to unlock (unencrypt) the mailbox, they will need to know the secret code that the letter is written in to be able to understand the message.

SQL query text and error messages can be encrypted by associating a IBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae during instance creation.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15710-3097-5054","score":0.0296703297,"text":"\nFor more information about envelope encryption, see [Protecting your sensitive data in VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-mng-datadata-encryption).\n\nAll your interaction with VPN for VPC is encrypted. For example, when you use an API or interact with the service through the User Interface to configure VPN gateways and VPN connections, all such interactions are encrypted end-to-end. Likewise, data elements that are related to your configuration are encrypted in transit and at rest. No personal or sensitive data is stored, processed, or transmitted. Data at rest is stored in an encrypted database.\n\nAfter the VPN for VPC is provisioned and the network connections are created, the encryption of data that you choose to transmit across the network is your responsibility.\n\n\n\n Instance storage data isolation and encryption \n\nThe instance storage disk or disks, which are attached to the virtual server instance, cannot be shared with any other virtual servers and cannot be accessed by any other virtual servers in the future. They are one-time use, single-attach, for the virtual server that requested the instance storage.\n\nInstance storage data is secured with on-disk encryption. The physical disks that are used for instance storage are self-encrypting with the strong AES-256 encryption standard. The data is automatically decrypted when your instance accesses the data. When your instance is shut down or deleted, the underlying storage space is erased and unrecoverable. At that point, the data is unrecoverable. For more information, see [Introduction to encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-basics).\n\nData is automatically encrypted on the physical media at the drive level.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb\/vpc\/images\/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04341-50239-52402","score":0.0294117647,"text":"\n3000460 -

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-891789-893528","score":0.0161290323,"text":"\nThe first snapshot is a full backup of the volume.

It is recommended that only one instance be created per account and the zone name be verified. It is critical that the zone name be verified before it is added. If a zone is deleted, another zone or the same zone cannot be added during the Free Trial Plan.\n* How many Free Trial instances can I have?\n\nYou can have, at most, one Free Trial instance per account, for the lifetime of the account. If you already have a free trial instance, if you delete a free trial instance, or if the free trial expires, you are not allowed to create another free trial instance. You can, however, create instances of other paid plan types (for example, Standard), independent of any free trials you might have created.\n* Can I downgrade from Standard to the Free Trial?\n\nNo. Downgrading from Standard to a Free Trial plan is not allowed.\n* My Free Trial has expired. What are my options?\n\nTo avoid any data loss you must upgrade from Free Trial to Standard prior to the expiration date. After that, we only support upgrading the Plan or Deleting the CIS instance. If the instance is not deleted or upgraded after 45 days (from the initiation of the instance) the configuration domain, global load balancers, pools, and health checks are deleted automatically.\n* What happened to Enterprise Package plans?\n\nStarting on 21 June 2023, you can no longer configure the Enterprise package plan. The functionality of this plan was split across various tiers and are now available in Enterprise Essential, Enterprise Advanced, and Enterprise Premier plans.

Use the following information to understand a simple use case for planning, creating, and configuring resources for your VPC, and learn about additional VPC overviews and VPC tutorials.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\n\n\n1. Set up your account to access VPC. Make sure that your account is [upgraded to a paid account](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-accountfaqschangeacct).\n2. Make sure that you have a public SSH key, which is used to connect to the virtual server instance. For example, generate an SSH key on your Linux server by running the following command:\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\n\n\nThis command generates two files, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. The generated public key is in the id_rsa.pub file under an .ssh directory in your home directory, for example, ...\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub.\n\nFor more information, see [SSH keys](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys).\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of prerequisites for using the API and CLI, see [Setting up your API and CLI environment](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating and configuring a VPC \n\nTo create and configure your VPC and other attached resources:\n\n\n\n1.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-891789-893528","score":0.0163934426,"text":"\nThe first snapshot is a full backup of the volume.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-891912-893651","score":0.0161290323,"text":"\nThe first snapshot is a full backup of the volume.

The team gets started by containerizing their apps and putting them in the cloud. With the use of modern containers, Developers can experiment easily with Node.js SDK and push changes to Development and Test systems, which are scaled out on separate clusters. Those pushes were automated with open toolchains and IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery. No longer were updates to the HR site languishing in slow, error-prone build processes. They can deliver incremental updates to their site, daily or even more frequently. Moreover, logging and monitoring for the HR site is rapidly integrated, especially for how the site pulls personalized data from back-end benefit systems. Developers don\u2019t waste time building complex logging systems, just to be able to troubleshoot live systems. Developers don't need to become experts in cloud security, they can enforce policy driven authentication easily by using IBM Cloud App ID.\n\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the HR site, they could easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. Another factor for less personnel costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the Developers can focus on delivering better employee experience for benefits enrollment.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-cs_uc_transport"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06929-7-1530","score":0.0158730159,"text":"\nIsolating workloads with a secure private network \n\nThis tutorial describes the use of Classic Infrastructure.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will create only one CA at a time.\n\nWatch the following video to learn about the process to create the peer's organization and the peer (for video tutorials on how to create an ordering service and a channel, see [video series](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/series\/ibm-blockchain-platform-console-video-series\/):\n\nVideo transcript\n\nHello everyone, and welcome to this demonstration of how to create a peer using the IBM Blockchain platform console. I\u2019ll be following the process from the IBM Blockchain platform documentation, which you can see here. At the end of this tutorial, you will have created this structure, representing the components related to org1. In our next video, we\u2019ll create an ordering service. And after that, a channel, to complete the infrastructure of our network.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll be using recommended values for the various fields in the UI. These are the same values you\u2019ll find in the docs, which are cataloged in tables for the various tasks. These values are not mandatory, but if you\u2019re using the console for the first time, we do recommended them. In cases where you have to reenter a value, for example an enroll ID and secret, which are not stored in the console, you will be able to refer to the tables in the documentation to remember what you entered. If you do choose different values, make sure to write them down somewhere.\n\nAlright, so let\u2019s get started creating that peer. If you're unfamiliar with Hyperledger Fabric, which the IBM Blockchain Platform is based on, you might not realize you have to create a Certificate Authority before you create a peer. This is because before we can create a peer, we have to create some identities. These identities allow a network entity, whether it\u2019s an admin or a node, to sign its actions using a certificate. Those certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, also known as a CA. Therefore, our first step in creating a peer is to create a CA and use it to register identities for the peer admin and for the peer itself.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.3333333333,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.167160455}}

This change means that your instance caused overflow of 87 GB more than the 20 GB plan allocation, for 12 hours. As the result, you're billed an overage charge based on 87 GB x 12 hours = 1044 GB hours for that extra space.\n\nOverage is calculated by using the maximum number of GB more than the plan allocation during a particular hour within the billing cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disk overage example \n\nAssume that you start a month of 30 days with a Standard plan service instance that uses 9 GB of storage.

First, you can upgrade to a paid [Standard plan](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan), which removes the write limitation immediately. Alternatively, you can delete data so that your total storage falls under the 1-GB limit and wait until the next daily storage check runs for your instance to allow writes again.\n\nIf you want to store more than one GB of data, or be able to scale provisioned throughput capacity, move to the [Standard plan](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan).\n\nYou're limited to one IBM Cloudant Lite plan instance per IBM Cloud account.

This tutorial is provided as an example of the steps you can follow to set up an enterprise by department, but you should carefully plan your enterprise structure around your organization's needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Create the enterprise \n\nEnterprises are created from an existing Subscription account. When you create the enterprise, the account is added to the enterprise hierarchy. Billing transitions to being managed by the enterprise, but its users and resources remain the same and are completely unaffected. For a complete description of account impacts, see [Creating an enterprise](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-create-enterprise).\n\n\n\n1. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Enterprise, and click Create.\n2. Enter the name of your company, such as Example Corp, to identify your enterprise.\n3. Enter your company's domain, such as examplecorp.com.\n4. Review the information about the impact to your account, and select I understand the impact to my account. Then, click Create. The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize). The second and third tier of the Example Corp. enterprise hierarchy contain the Marketing, Development, Sales, Design, and Engineering account groups. Complete the following steps to create the account groups:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-enterprise-tutorial&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1324577-1326393","score":0.0153846154,"text":"\nA user is required to have have at a minimum the platform role of editor for all IAM enabled services, or at least for Cloud Object Service. For more information, see the [IAM documentation on roles](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions).\n* Which one of my instances uses a Lite plan?\n\nAn account is limited to a single instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage that uses a Lite plan. You can find this instance three different ways:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the [catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/objectstorage\/create) and attempt to make a new Lite instance. An error will pop up prompting you to delete the existing instance, and provides a link to the current Lite instance.\n2. Navigate to the storage section of the resource list, and click on any area of blank space to select an instance of Object Storage. An informational sidebar will appear and provide the plan name: either Lite or Standard.\n3. Use the CLI to search for the resource:\n\n\n\nibmcloud resource search \"service_name:cloud-object-storage AND 2fdf0c08-2d32-4f46-84b5-32e0c92fffd8\"\n* How do I upgrade a service instance from Lite to Standard?\n\nTypically, this is easily done from the IBM Cloud Object Storage console found here [https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/objectstorage\/](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/objectstorage\/), select the correct name of Cloud Object Storage Instance you wish to upgrade,click on Plan in the navigation menu, located after Instance Usage. Select the \"standard\" plan and hit save.\n\nIn cases where the instance has been locked due to exceeding the maximum allowed size of a Lite instance it may be necessary to use the CLI. The plan ID for a standard Object Storage instance is 744bfc56-d12c-4866-88d5-dac9139e0e5d (if curious, this can be found by issuing the CLI command ic catalog service cloud-object-storage).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.3706656904}}

You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-accountsliteaccount).\n* How many apps can I build?\n\nThere's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.\n\nIf you created a Lite account before 12 August 2021, you can build and deploy apps with 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.\n* What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?\n\nReaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.\n\nYou can check your usage by going to Manage > Billing and usage in the IBM Cloud console, and selecting Usage.

These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/home\/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01545-6013-8003","score":0.0325224749,"text":"\n[Kubernetes](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/) is a container orchestrator to manage the lifecycle of containerized apps in a cluster of worker nodes.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06004-15614-17542","score":0.0461538462,"text":"\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

Sometimes, for example during a security audit, you might want to prevent someone on your team from accidentally deleting a secret. Or, if you plan to rotate your secrets regularly, you might be looking for a way to safely deploy the newest version of a secret after a rotation takes place. With locks, you can build automated workflows that help you to:\n\n\n\n* Indicate that a secret is in use by one or more applications or services.\n* Prevent secret data from being deleted even after a secret expires.\n* Safely delete older versions of secrets after the newest version is fully deployed to your applications.\n* Avoid inadvertent downtime in your applications.\n\n\n\nTo learn about the suggested guidelines for using locks to avoid application downtime, check out [Best practices for rotating and locking secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-rotate-secretsbest-practices-lock-secrets).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you begin, be sure that you have the required level of access.

A service credential is a collection of important information that is needed to connect to an instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage. It gives a user an identifier for the instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage (that is, the Resource Instance ID), service and authorization endpoints, and a means of associating the subject with an API key (that is, Service ID). When you create the service credential you have the option of either associating it with an existing service ID, or creating a new service ID.\n\nYou might want your development team to be able to use the console to view Object Storage instances and Kubernetes clusters. They would need Viewer roles on the Object Storage resources and Administrator roles on the Container Service. The Viewer role allows for the user to only see that the instance exists, and to view existing credentials, but not to view buckets and objects. When the service credentials were created, they were associated with a service ID. This service ID would need to have the Manager or Writer role on the instance to be able to create and delete buckets and objects.\n\nFor more information on IAM roles and permissions, see [the IAM overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage\/iam?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-administrators"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12479-11684-13175","score":0.0153846154,"text":"\nTo create an IAM credential from the IBM Cloud CLI, run the [ibmcloud secrets-manager secret-create](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-cli-plugin-secrets-manager-clisecrets-manager-cli-secret-create-command) command.\n\nexport SECRET_ID=ibmcloud secrets-manager secret-create --resources '[{\"name\":\"test-iam-credentials\",\"description\":\"Extended description for my secret.\",\"access_groups\":\"$ACCESS_GROUP_ID\"],\"secret_group_id\":\"$SECRET_GROUP_ID\",\"ttl\":\"2h\",\"labels\":\"storage\",\"us-south\"]}]' --output json | jq -r \".resources[].id\"\n\nYou can also create an IAM credential by using the Secrets Manager UI.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.25,"recall_5":0.25,"recall_10":0.25,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.296081911,"ndcg_cut_5":0.2463023887,"ndcg_cut_10":0.2463023887}}

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04327-20640-21515","score":0.0158730159,"text":"\n\"spark_application_id\" : \"app-20211009103247-0000\",\n\"spark_application_name\" : \"PythonWordCount\",\n\"state\" : \"finished\",\n\"submission_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:23:50Z\",\n\"start_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:24:01Z\",\n\"end_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:25:18Z\",\n\"finish_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:25:18Z\",\n\"auto_termination_time\" : \"2021-04-24T04:24:01Z\"\n}, {\n\"id\" : \"a2a2b23f-0929-4c49-9cc0-bd4c2bf953d9\",\n\"spark_application_id\" : \"app-20211009103147-0000\",\n\"spark_application_name\" : \"PythonWordCount\",\n\"state\" : \"finished\",\n\"submission_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:21:50Z\",\n\"start_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:22:01Z\",\n\"end_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:23:18Z\",\n\"finish_time\" : \"2021-04-21T04:23:18Z\",\n\"auto_termination_time\" : \"2021-04-24T04:22:01Z\"\n} ],\n\"first\" : {\n\"href\" : \"https:\/\/api.us-south.ae.cloud.ibm.com\/v3\/analytics_engines\/e64c907a-e82f-46fd-addc-ccfafbd28b09\/spark_applications?limit=25\"\n},\n\"next\" : {","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cli?topic=cli-CLI_analytics_engine"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03329-3417-4930","score":0.0441176471,"text":"\nYou successfully started to build your training data by adding prebuilt content from IBM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Build a dialog \n\nA [dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully.

Containment is the rate at which your assistant is able to satisfy a customer's request without human intervention per conversation.\n\nTo measure containment accurately, the metric must be able to identify when a human intervention occurs. The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant. For example, you might direct customers to your call center phone number or to an online support ticket form URL.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03071-3000-4820","score":0.0300904977,"text":"\nYou have successfully enabled the @sys-date, @sys-time, and @sys-number system entities. Now you can use them in your dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 3: Add a dialog node with slots \n\nA dialog node represents the start of a thread of dialog between your assistant and the user. It contains a condition that must be met for the node to be processed by your assistant. At a minimum, it also contains a response. For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response. You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more. (If you want to learn more about complex dialogs, you can complete the [Building a complex dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial) tutorial.)\n\nThe node that you will add in this step is one that contains slots.

In addition to servicing API requests, these services monitor the region's hardware and capabilities, and perform orchestration to keep your VPC resources available and performing optimally. All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. Since your instances do not run on control nodes, they are separated from these services. \n VPC control plane agent services A small set of VPC control plane agents is deployed across hypervisor nodes in the region. For example, agents are used to create new virtual server instances on the nodes, and to forward logs, metrics, and alerts off the node for use by the broader VPC control plane services. All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. \n VPC control plane data store Your VPC resources are persisted in a data store that is replicated across all zones in the region. This store contains metadata about these resources only, and does not contain your data. For example, this store contains information about each VPC Image resource, such as its name, CRN, and creation date. However, it does not contain the image data itself, which is hosted on the storage devices. All communication between control plane services and the control plane data store is secure and encrypted. \n Block Storage Each zone of each region contains a set of replicated storage devices, which host the data for your VPC volumes. Your data is always encrypted at rest, and is isolated to your account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-isolation"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06007-7-1994","score":0.0163934426,"text":"\nUnderstanding network basics of VPC clusters \n\nWhen you create your cluster, you must choose a networking setup so that certain cluster components can communicate with each other and with networks or services outside of the cluster.\n\n\n\n* [Worker-to-worker communication](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-worker): All worker nodes must be able to communicate with each other on the private network through VPC subnets.\n* [Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-workeruser-master): Your worker nodes and your authorized cluster users can communicate with the Kubernetes master securely over virtual private endpoints or cloud service endpoints.\n* [Worker communication to other services or networks](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-worker-services-onprem): Allow your worker nodes to securely communicate with other IBM Cloud services, such as IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry, to on-premises networks, to other VPCs, or to classic infrastructure resources.\n* [External communication to apps that run on worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basicsvpc-external-workers): Allow public or private requests into the cluster as well as requests out of the cluster to a public endpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n Worker-to-worker communication using VPC subnets \n\nBefore you create a VPC cluster for the first time, you must [create a VPC subnet](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/vpc\/provision\/network) in each zone where you want to deploy worker nodes.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb\/vpc\/images\/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05713-132600-134017","score":0.0161290323,"text":"\n* [Creating a VPC cluster in the console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cluster-create-vpc-gen2clusters_vpcg2_ui)\n* [Creating VPC clusters from the CLI](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cluster-create-vpc-gen2cluster_vpcg2_cli)\n* [Example commands to create VPC clusters](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cluster-create-vpc-gen2cluster_create_vpc)\n* [Creating a VPC cluster with Terraform](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cluster-create-vpc-gen2cluster_vpcg2_tf)\n\n\n\n[Creating clusters on dedicated hosts for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cluster-create-dedicated-hostscluster-create-dedicated-hosts)\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessing clusters \n\n[Accessing clusters](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-access_clusteraccess_cluster)\n\n\n\n* [Prerequisites](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-access_clusterprereqs)\n* [Accessing clusters through the public cloud service endpoint](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-access_clusteraccess_public_se)\n* [Accessing clusters through the private cloud service endpoint](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-access_clusteraccess_private_se)\n\n\n\n* [Accessing VPC clusters through the private cloud service endpoint](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-access_clustervpc_private_se)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04815-1593-3271","score":0.0161290323,"text":"\n* When you create your cluster, you must choose a VPC networking setup so that certain cluster components can communicate with each other and with networks or services outside of the cluster.\n\n\n\n* Worker-to-worker communication: All worker nodes must be able to communicate with each other on the private network through VPC subnets.\n* Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication: Your worker nodes and your authorized cluster users can communicate with the Kubernetes master securely over virtual private endpoints or cloud service endpoints.\n* Worker communication to other services or networks: Allow your worker nodes to securely communicate with other IBM Cloud services, such as IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry, to on-premises networks, to other VPCs, or to classic infrastructure resources.\n* External communication to apps that run on worker nodes: Allow public or private requests into the cluster as well as requests out of the cluster to a public endpoint.\n\n\n\n* Understanding of [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-roks-overviewservice-concepts)\n* Components that are set up in a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud [VPC cluster architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-service-architectureservice-arch-vpc-4)\n\n![IKS on VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/b7b9235ce6abd45b66931867c388cf107d38e15b\/cloud-native-journey\/roks-on-vpc\/images\/overview\/arch_roks_vpc.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next Steps \n\nThe next step on the deployment journey is:\n\n\n\n* [Prepare your IBM Cloud account](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-native-journey?topic=cloud-native-journey-cloud-native-roks-prepare-account)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-native-journey?topic=cloud-native-journey-cloud-native-roks-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12170-1498-3591","score":0.0158730159,"text":"\nVPC VPC provides you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud. \n zones You must have one VPC subnet for each zone in your cluster.

After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored.

The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

As a result, [destroying resources](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-compliancedata-deletion) is not recommended for production environments unless absolutely necessary.\n* What happens if I try to delete a key that's actively encrypting data?\n\nFor your protection, Key Protect prevents the deletion of a key that's actively encrypting data in the cloud. If you try to delete a key that's registered with a cloud resource, the action won't succeed.\n\nIf needed, you can [force deletion on a key](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-delete-keysdelete-keys-force-delete) by using the Key Protect APIs. [Review which resources are encrypted by the key](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-view-protected-resources) and verify with the owner of the resources to ensure you no longer require access to that data.\n\nIf you can't delete a key because a retention policy exists on the associated resource, contact the account owner to remove the retention policy on that resource.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09159-4-1910","score":0.0447963801,"text":"\n* UI\n* API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Restoring keys \n\nWhen a key is deleted, it is moved to a \"destroyed\" state. However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Ties key states to the time from a key's deletion to what actions are possible with the key.\n\n Time from key deletion Name of key state Can view\/access key data? Can restore? \n\n One-30 days Destroyed Yes Yes \n 30-90 days Destroyed Yes No \n After 90 days Purged* No No \n\n\n\nNote: because purged keys are completely inaccessible and \"destroyed\" in the common usage of the word, there is technically no \"purged\" key state. Purged keys are simply gone and therefore don't have a \"state\" one way or another.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-restore-keys"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09064-1360-3081","score":0.0434968017,"text":"\nNote that you will not be able to delete the key if it is protecting a registered IBM Cloud resource that's non-erasable due to a [retention policy](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutableimmutable-terminology-policy).\n\n\n\nAfter you delete a key, the key transitions to the Destroyed state. Any data encrypted by keys in this state is no longer accessible. Metadata that is associated with the key, such as the key's deletion date, is kept in the Key Protect database. Destroyed keys can be recovered after up to 30 days or their expiration date, whichever is sooner. After 30 days, keys can no longer be recovered, and become eligible to be purged after 90 days, a process that shreds the key material and makes its metadata inaccessible.\n\nIf a user [has the KeyPurge attribute](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-grant-access-keysgrant-access-keys-specific-functions), they can purge a key after four hours.

Critical data that changes more often might require more frequent backups than static data. Ask which data is most critical and which is to be archived.\n* Keep costs down by retaining backups for only while you need them to prevent data loss. Plan timely backups to restore data that might be deleted or corrupted. Think about the type of events that might happen. Ask how much data you can afford to lose. The answers can help you decide on a backup interval.\n* Ask how quickly you need to recover the data. Frequent backups that cover smaller incremental changes to your data afford quicker restoration. Run a test failover and volume restore to get an idea of the time it can take.\n* For best performance, stagger your backup jobs by creating backup plans with different intervals. You can have up to four different backup plans per backup policy.\n* For large volumes, consider a shorter retention period so that you don't exceed the 10 TB limit for all volume backups.\n* If you have volumes in different regions, create separate backup policies for each region. You're limited to 10 backup policies per account in a region.\n* Ensure that the volumes that you tagged for backups are attached to a virtual server instance. You can't back up detached volumes.\n* Provide a unique name for your backup policy. If you have a convention for naming volumes, you might name a backup policy by using a similar convention. Backups that are created by a policy can also follow the convention. As the number of backups grow, a good naming convention can make them more identifiable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practices for user actions \n\n\n\n* Organize tags that you apply to volumes and specify in backup policies. Ensure that multiple policies aren't using the same tags for target resources because that might trigger duplicate volume backups. You need only one tag to match to trigger a backup.\n* Determine what tags are already assigned to a volume from the list of Block Storage for VPC volumes.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08626-1538-3184","score":0.0163934426,"text":"\nAll root keys and standard keys, whether generated by Hyper Protect Crypto Services or imported by you, can be restored.\n\n\n\n How do I know whether a key can be restored? \n\nTo see whether a destroyed key can be restored:\n\n\n\n1.

You can also create extra snapshot schedules, manually delete copies, and manage schedules based on your requirements.\n* The second way is to take a manual snapshot.\n\n\n\nA snapshot copy is a read-only image of a File Storage for Classic volume that captures the state of the volume at a point in time. Snapshot copies are efficient both in the time that is needed to create them and in storage space. A File Storage for Classic snapshot copy takes only a few seconds to create. It's typically less than 1 second, regardless of the size of the volume or the level of activity on the storage. After a snapshot copy is created, changes to data objects are reflected in updates to the current version of the objects, as if Snapshot copies didn't exist. Meanwhile, the copy of the data remains stable.\n\nA Snapshot copy incurs no performance decrease. Users can easily store up to 50 scheduled snapshots and 50 manual snapshots per File Storage for Classic volume, all of which are accessible as read-only and online versions of the data.\n\nWith snapshots, you can:\n\n\n\n* Nondisruptively create point-in-time recovery points,\n* Revert volumes to previous points-in-time.\n\n\n\nYou must purchase some amount of snapshot space for your volume first so you can take snapshots of it. The snapshot space can be added during the initial order or afterward through the Volume Details page. Scheduled and manual snapshots share the snapshot space, so make sure you order enough Snapshot space.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-snapshots"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Purged keys are simply gone and therefore don't have a \"state\" one way or another.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-restore-keys"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03039-0-644","score":0.0163934426,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Disaster recovery \n\nRecovering from potential disasters requires planning and preparation.\n\nYou are responsible for understanding your configuration, customization, and usage of Watson Assistant.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12791-59012-61053","score":0.0461538462,"text":"\nBilling \n\nYou can give users access to update account settings, view subscriptions, view offers, apply subscription and feature codes, update spending limits, and track usage by using the Billing service.\n\n\n\nTable 4.

If you change the percentage of users receiving that feature from 25% to 50%, partitions 25,001 to 50,000 would be added to the set of partitions already receiving that feature.\n\nPercentage rollout capability is available for Lite and Enterprise plans.\n\nFollowing are some of the percentage rollout scenarios:\n\n\n\n* If the feature flag is disabled, then SDK returns the default Disabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rules and no percentage rollout is set, then the SDK returns default Enabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rule and percentage rollout is set to 0%, then the SDK returns Disabled value for all users.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-feature-flags"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02680-9660-11121","score":0.0300768883,"text":"\n@Override\npublic void onConfigurationUpdate() {\n\/\/ ADD YOUR CODE\n}\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples for using property and feature-related APIs for Android apps written in Java \n\nRefer to the examples for using the property and feature-related APIs.\n\n\n\n* Get single feature\n\nFeature feature = appConfiguration.getFeature(\"featureId\");\n* Get all features\n\nHashMap<String,Feature> features = appConfiguration.getFeatures();\n* Feature evaluation\n\nYou can use the feature.getCurrentValue() method to evaluate the value of the feature flag.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03798-0-2240","score":0.0471626734,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Understanding my invoice \n\nBillable accounts receive a monthly invoice for the usage charges and other fees that are incurred.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03787-3261-5506","score":0.0296312555,"text":"\nFor support subscriptions that were bought before this date, credit is available on a month-to-month basis. When you buy or renew a support subscription, any existing active support subscriptions are converted to the term-based model for the remainder of their term.\n\nFor example, you might have a support subscription for $200 per month with three months remaining. When you buy a new support subscription, the existing subscription is converted to a new one with $600 of credit that can be used anytime within those three months.\n\n\n\n\n\n Viewing subscription usage \n\nYou can view the subscriptions in your account to track your credit spending. To access this information, you need an access policy with the Viewer role or higher on the Billing account management service. See [IAM access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-userroles) for more information.\n\n\n\n Platform subscriptions \n\nTo view your platform and service subscription usage, in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Subscriptions.\n\n\n\n* Click the tabs to view spending details and trends about your subscription usage, including any usage overages that your account incurred. For example, the credit burndown view displays how your credit balance changes over time, and the spending by month view displays your monthly spending from all subscriptions.\n* View all active and inactive subscriptions in your account in the tables. For multi-year subscriptions, each term is displayed separately. Active subscriptions are subscriptions that still have remaining credit to spend and time that's left in the subscription term. Upcoming subscriptions are subscriptions were added to the account but haven't yet reached their term period. A subscription is inactive if its term expires or all of its credit is spent.\n\n\n\nYou can use the spending and usage information on the Subscriptions page to evaluate whether your subscriptions suit your usage needs. For example, if you consistently have overages, you might increase your monthly spending commitment to save money on that usage. To buy new subscriptions or change future subscription amounts, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud?contactmodule).\n\n\n\n\n\n Support subscriptions","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-5228-7163","score":0.0163934426,"text":"\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

In either case, you manage your credit card from the [Payments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/payments) page in the IBM Cloud console.\n\nIf you own one of the following accounts, in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, you can go to Manage > Billing and usage to make a one-time payment, change your credit card details, view your billing items, and manage your invoices.\n\n\n\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts based in the US with any payment method other than a credit card\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts not based in the US\n* New and existing Subscription accounts worldwide\n\n\n\nThe process for updating a credit card requires a manual review that might take a few days to process.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost.

You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.4306765581,"ndcg_cut_10":0.4306765581}}

Depending on the IVR service provider, you might need to configure call transfer to use a SIP BYE request instead. Use the transfer_method attribute to specify how to transfer the call, using either refer or hangup. When transfer_method is set to hangup instead of refer, the behavior of the transfer action changes. Instead of sending a SIP REFER request, the phone integration plays back any associated text and then hangs up the call by sending a SIP BYE request.\n\nAfter the hangup, the phone integration passes the transfer destination that is specified in the url attribute to the call anchor in the BYE message. The header field that contains the transfer target is determined by the transfer_target_header attribute. If the transfer_target_header attribute isn't specified, the phone integration uses Transfer-Target.\n\n{\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"connect_to_agent\",\n\"transfer_info\": {\n\"target\": {\n\"service_desk\": {\n\"sip\": {\n\"uri\": \"sip:user\\@domain.com\",\n\"transfer_method\": \"hangup\",\n\"transfer_target_header\": \"Transfer-Target\"\n}\n}\n}\n},\n\"agent_available\": {\n\"message\": \"Please hold on while I connect you with a live agent.\"\n},\n\"agent_unavailable\": {\n\"message\": \"Sorry, I could not find an agent.\"\n},\n\"message_to_human_agent\": \"The caller needs help resetting their password\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Transferring upon failure \n\nTo configure transfer on failures, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. For more information, see [Configuring backup call center support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-transfer-service).\n* Call failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent.\n\n\n\nIf, after you transfer the call to a human, the connection to a live agent fails for any reason, you can configure what to do.\n\n\n\n* Transfer failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller if transfer to a live agent fails. The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08051-39206-40835","score":0.0315136476,"text":"\nIf the problem continues, go to [IBM Cloud Support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/unifiedsupport\/supportcenter).\n\n\n\n\n\n BXNUI0203E \n\nMessage: The routes for the app weren't retrieved because of an internal error.\n\nTry again later.

When the failover needs to be manually triggered, make the following changes:\n\n\n\n* The embed script that contains your integration ID, region, service instance ID, and subscription ID (if applicable) needs be changed or updated to use the IDs for the new integration and region.\n* If you are using Salesforce or ZenDesk integrations for connecting to human agents, update the configuration within those systems to make sure they can communicate with the correct integration. Follow the instructions on the Live agent tab in the web chat configuration for setting up those systems. This is only needed for obtaining the conversation history for the agent.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16250-5445-7809","score":0.030798389,"text":"\nTo support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call.

The final part of the sequence pattern specifies what is the input to the pattern; it might be a column from a previously defined view, or it might be the entire document text.\n\npattern <pattern specification> [return clause] [with inline_match on <viewname.colname>]\n\n\n\n\n\n Description \n\n\n\n* <pattern specification>\n\nA <pattern specification> is composed of multiple Atoms. An individual Atom can be a column from an already-defined view, a fixed string, or a regular expression. You can specify your Atoms to be optional and repeating, and specify token gaps between Atoms.\n\nThe pattern specification is part of a larger AQL statement, which includes an extract clause.\n\nHere is a simple example of how to create a view that contains three adjacent matches from earlier defined views.

If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 \/ 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance. Service availability is defined within the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Service Description](https:\/\/www-03.ibm.com\/software\/sla\/sladb.nsf\/pdf\/6605-17\/$file\/i126-6605-17_06-2019_en_US.pdf).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the data center have an impact on performance and reliability of a virtual server? \n\nNo, all of the data centers are of the same quality. For best availability, follow the hints in question [How do I provide my applications in high availability?]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14549-16227-18518","score":0.0298573975,"text":"\nConfiguration is required for access to the internet and the IBM Services network.

Only VMs in this Organization virtual data center can connect to and see traffic on the internal Organization virtual data center network.\n\nThe isolated Organization virtual data center network provides an Organization virtual data center with an isolated, private network that multiple VMs and vApps can connect to. This network provides no connectivity to VMs outside the Organization virtual data center. VMs that are outside of the Organization virtual data center have no connectivity to VMs that are in the Organization virtual data center.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a network \n\nFrom the tenant portal, use the following procedures to create a sample network topology that includes: configuring DHCP services, defining Source NAT (SNAT) and Destination NAT (DNAT) rules, and creating firewall rules on the edge gateway to allow access to the internet.

To limit the VPN traffic to only my-secure-namespace, you can create Calico global network policies.\n\nBefore you use this solution, review the following considerations and limitations.\n\n\n\n* You don't need to deploy the strongSwan Helm chart into the specified namespace. The strongSwan VPN pod and the routes daemon set can be deployed into kube-system or any other namespace. If the strongSwan VPN is not deployed into the specified namespace, then the vpn-strongswan-ping-remote-ip-1 Helm test fails. This failure is expected and acceptable. The test pings the remote.privateIPtoPing private IP address of the on-premises VPN gateway from a pod which is not in the namespace that has direct access to the remote subnet. However, the VPN pod is still able to forward traffic to pods in the namespaces that do have routes to the remote subnet, and traffic can still flow correctly. The VPN state is still ESTABLISHED and pods in the specified namespace can connect over the VPN.\n* The Calico global network policies in the following steps don't prevent Kubernetes pods that use host networking from sending and receiving data over the VPN. When a pod is configured with host networking, the app running in the pod can listen on the network interfaces of the worker node that it is on. These host networking pods can exist in any namespace. To determine which pods have host networking, run oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide and look for any pods that don't have a 172.30.0.0\/16 pod IP address. If you want to prevent host networking pods from sending and receiving data over the VPN, you can set the following options in your values.yaml deployment file: local.subnet: 172.30.0.0\/16 and enablePodSNAT: false. These configuration settings expose all the Kubernetes pods over the VPN connection to the remote network.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06063-53153-55320","score":0.0434782609,"text":"\nImage Vulnerability Scanner: By default, Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities.

A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies.

Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access.

This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-1160-2754","score":0.0454545455,"text":"\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/depmodels\/cloud\/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/training\/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/35-Connectivity.svg)](https:\/\/community.ibm.com\/community\/user\/publiccloud\/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

The next part is called The Document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Document video \n\nLearn about IBM Cloudant databases and documents work.\n\n\n\n* The Document video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 2 - The IBM Cloudant Document.\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that IBM Cloudant is a JSON document store. Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06501-7-1686","score":0.0441176471,"text":"\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way. It has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database.

If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00518-7-1546","score":0.0296442688,"text":"\nDesign document management \n\nThe scalable JSON data store for IBM Cloudant has several querying mechanisms, all of which generate indices that are created and maintained separately from the core data.\n\nArticle contributed by Glynn Bird, Developer Advocate at IBM Cloudant, [glynn@cloudant.com](mailto:glynn@cloudant.com).\n\nIndexing isn't performed immediately when a document is saved. Instead, indexing is scheduled to happen later, providing a faster, non-blocking write throughput.\n\n\n\n* MapReduce views are indexes into the data set with key value pairs that are stored in a BTree for efficient retrieval by key or range of keys.\n* Search Indexes are constructed by using Apache Lucene to allow free-text search, faceting, and complex ad hoc queries.\n\n\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae's [search indexes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search) and [MapReduce views](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-views-mapreduce) are configured by adding design documents to a database.

IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate.

While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run.

Exceeding this limit causes a [413 error](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).\n\nIBM Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem) model for data. If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1\/icons\/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-accountsliteaccount).\n* How many apps can I build?\n\nThere's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.\n\nIf you created a Lite account before 12 August 2021, you can build and deploy apps with 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.\n* What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?\n\nReaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.\n\nYou can check your usage by going to Manage > Billing and usage in the IBM Cloud console, and selecting Usage.

For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field.

You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant. We could decide to add the \"address\" object only to the following documents:\n\n\n\n* Documents that are created from now on.\n* Only documents that we have addresses for.\n\n\n\nIn other words, documents of the same type can have fields present or missing.\n\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database.

The following guidelines (Landis and Koch, 1977) provide a starting point for assessing overall performance.\n\nTable 1: Inter-annotator Guidelines\n\n\n\n Score Agreement level \n\n <0 Poor \n .01 - .20 Slight \n .21 - .40 Fair \n .41 - .60 Moderate \n .61 - .80 Substantial \n .81 - 1.0 Perfect \n\n\n\nThe score in the other columns is an F1 measure. It represents the level of annotation consistency between a pair of human annotators. The value can range from 0 to 1, where perfect agreement is indicated by the score 1. What constitutes an acceptable level of agreement depends on your domain data and type system. But to provide an example, here are the F1 thresholds that project managers expect to be met or exceeded in projects that are based on the KLUE type system:\n\n\n\n* Mentions with entity types: 0.85\n* Relations: 0.8\n* Coreference chains: 0.9\n\n\n\nInterpreting the scores depends on the complexity of your type system, the amount and complexity of the content annotated, how experienced the human annotators are, and other factors. For example, if the annotation task is focused on labeling parts of speech, you might expect to see a high score because of how well-defined the parts of speech are. But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-build-groundtruth"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1234045-1235864","score":0.0158730159,"text":"\nYou can obtain more information about the volume, such as how much disk space is taken and how much is available, from your Compute host's operating system.\n\nYou can use the following commands.\n\n\n\n* Linux\u00ae:\n\ndf -h\n\nThe command provides an output that shows how much space is available space and the percentage used.\n\n$ df -hT \/dev\/sda1\nFilesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n\/dev\/sda1 disk 6.0G 1.2G 4.9G 20% \/\n* Windows\u00ae: you have two options.\n\nfsutil volume diskfree C:\n\ndir C:\n\nThe last line of the output shows how much space is unused.\n\nYou can also view the free disk space in the File Explorer by clicking This PC.\n\n\n\n* Does the volume need to be pre-warmed to achieve expected throughput?\n\nPre-warming is not needed.

It represents the level of annotation consistency between a pair of human annotators. The value can range from 0 to 1, where perfect agreement is indicated by the score 1. What constitutes an acceptable level of agreement depends on your domain data and type system. But to provide an example, here are the F1 thresholds that project managers expect to be met or exceeded in projects that are based on the KLUE type system:\n\n\n\n* Mentions with entity types: 0.85\n* Relations: 0.8\n* Coreference chains: 0.9\n\n\n\nInterpreting the scores depends on the complexity of your type system, the amount and complexity of the content annotated, how experienced the human annotators are, and other factors. For example, if the annotation task is focused on labeling parts of speech, you might expect to see a high score because of how well-defined the parts of speech are. But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-build-groundtruth"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6713860725,"ndcg_cut_10":0.819427028}}

Density can be impacted when a mention that is significant in the domain literature occurs often, but is annotated as different types across the document set.\n\nLow precision is often an indication that you need to improve annotation consistency. To do so, review the annotation guidelines, better train the human annotators, and ensure that human annotators are working in concert and not in isolation from one another.\n\nCheck the inter-annotator agreement score. This score, which measures the degree of agreement between different annotators' output on the same document, is a valuable number. Not only does this score tell you the quality of the ground truth documents that will be used to train the machine learning model, but it also indicates the upper bound of machine learning model performance. A model that is trained on these documents is unlikely to outperform the best agreement that humans can reach. For example, if performance persists at 75 and does not go higher, take a look at the inter-annotator agreement results. If the inter-annotator agreement score is 80, take actions to better train the human annotators and ensure that conflicts are correctly resolved (according to the annotation guidelines) during adjudication. If humans can't agree on how something should be labeled, then it's unlikely that a machine learning model will apply the correct labels.\n* Enhance human annotator guidelines\n\nClear and comprehensive annotator guidelines are a crucial part of a harmonious and successful annotation development effort. Human annotators have a tough job to do. There can be nuances in assigning entity and relation types that are hard to anticipate until you start to work with the domain documents. The guidelines can provide a sanity check to human annotators as they evaluate documents. The guidelines should be a living and changing document, especially at the beginning of the annotation process. They provide a key feedback loop because a human annotator can capture things she learned while annotating a few documents, then as she or someone else annotates a few more documents, new tips and gotchas can be added to the guideline, and so on.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-ml"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02839-3583-5403","score":0.0434782609,"text":"\nIf your skill will support a language with right-to-left directional text, such as Hebrew, configure the bidirectional capabilities.\n\nClick the options icon from the skill tile ![Skill options icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/kebab.png), and then select Language preferences.

It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

If you need this information for your custom language model, contact your IBM Support representative.\n\n\n\n General guidelines for all languages \n\nFollow these guidelines when specifying a sounds-like for any language:\n\n\n\n* Do not use punctuation characters in sounds-likes. For example, do not use periods, dashes, underscores, commas, end of sentence punctuation characters, and special characters such as dollar and euro signs, parentheses, brackets, and braces.\n* Use alphabetic characters that are valid for your language. For English, this includes a-z and A-Z. For other languages, valid characters can include accented letters or language-specific characters.\n* In English, substitute equivalent English letters for non-English or accented letters. For example, s for \u00e7, ny for \u00f1, or e for \u00e8.\n* Use real or made-up words that are pronounceable for words that are difficult to pronounce. For example, in English you can use the sounds-like shuchesnie for the word Sczcesny.\n* Use the spelling of numbers without dashes. For example, for the number 75, use seventy five in English, setenta y cinco in Spanish, and soixante quinze in French.\n* To pronounce a single letter, use the letter followed by a space. For example, use N C A A, notN. C. A. A., N.C.A.A., or NCAA.\n* You can include multiple words that are separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n* For most languages, the service enforces a maximum of 40 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces.\n* For Japanese, the service enforces a maximum limit of 25 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces. If you add a custom word or sounds-like that exceeds this limit, the service automatically treats the word as if it were added by a corpus. The word does not appear as a custom word for the model.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-corporaWords-ng"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13623-4280-6019","score":0.0285714286,"text":"\n* Spanish (Castilian, Latin American, and North American dialects)\n\n\n\nFor different languages, the service offers female voices, male voices, or both.

The runtime component receives a collection of documents and runs the extractor on each document to extract information from that document.\n\nAn extractor consists of one or more AQL modules to create a collection of views that each defines a relation. Some of these views are designated as output views, while others are non-output views. Non-output views can include some views that are imported into or exported from a module. It is important to note that output views and exported views are orthogonal. For example, a view that is exported does not qualify as a view that is output. In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module. When two or more modules are combined to form an extractor, the duplicate-free union of Document schemas of all modules is the required Document view.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16471-106006-108222","score":0.0317460317,"text":"\nAll other spans are left untouched.\n* LeftToRight\n\nThis policy processes the spans in order from left to right.

By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical. All inputs with a null <consolidate target> result in a single output tuple, which is chosen randomly among those inputs. This behavior is similar to how tuples are consolidated with an identical span in the target column. The exception to resulting in a single output tuple is if the policy is ContainsButNotEqual. In that case, the null <consolidate target> outputs all inputs with null consolidate target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nExample 1: Consolidate on single column\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the field Person.name of all output tuples and to use the ContainedWithin consolidation policy to resolve overlap.\n\nconsolidate on Person.name\nusing 'ContainedWithin'\n\nExample 2: Consolidate on expression, involving multiple columns\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the result of applying the CombineSpans scalar function to fields Person.firstname and Person.lastname in each output tuple.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03268-5869-7269","score":0.03125,"text":"\nYou might want to define the customization in the welcome node or another node that is triggered early in the conversation so it is applied any time disambiguation is triggered.\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n]\n},\n\"context\": {\n\"smsAction\": {\n\"command\": \"smsActSetDisambiguationConfig\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"prefixText\": \"%s.\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\nWhen displayed, the assistant shows the introductory text that is configured for disambiguation, such as Did you mean?.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there.

Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14639-1516-2901","score":0.0476190476,"text":"\nEnsure that you do not have any NSX objects that are expanded into the secondary instance that you want to delete.\n3.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there. Activating the domain before migrating from CIS can cause your domain to changed to a [Moved state](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status).\n\n\n\n\n\n I added a user to my account and gave that user permission to manage Internet Services instance(s). Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04149-4598-6150","score":0.0305361305,"text":"\nIf you are unsure of who the registrar is for your domain, you can look it up at [whois.icann.org](https:\/\/whois.icann.org\/).\n\nIf you delegate a subdomain (for instance, subdomain.example.com) from another DNS provider, you must replace the existing name server (NS) records and replace them with a name server record for each of the name servers that are provided by CIS. See [Managing DNS records in Cloudflare](https:\/\/developers.cloudflare.com\/dns\/manage-dns-records\/how-to\/create-dns-records\/) for detailed instructions by provider.\n\nAfter you configure your registrar or DNS provider, it can take up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect. When we verify that the specified name servers were configured correctly for your domain or subdomain, the domain's status changes from Pending to Active.\n\nYour domain must move to Active state within 60 days or your domain and any configuration data is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 5. Ensure that CIS is resolving the domain information for your application, hostname, or website \n\nTo proceed, select Reliability > DNS. Be sure to add the appropriate DNS records.

Type in the information about your DNS record and then click Add record to implement your changes.\n\nAfter creating your records, consider turning on the Proxy setting. Most of the features of CIS require that the internet traffic to your site flow through CIS infrastructure. In other words, it only applies to proxied records and load balancers. To really reap the benefit of CIS, make sure that your DNS records and load balancers have the proxy setting enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting up and manage your caching \n\nNext, you can set up caching. You have the option of three types of caching, available from the caching screen list menu.\n\n\n\n* No query string: Only delivers resources from cache when there is no query string.\n* Query string independent: Delivers the same resource to everyone independent of the query string. The Ignore Query String setting applies only to static file extensions. This setting removes the query string when generating the cache key, so that a request for style.css?something is normalized to style.css when serving from the cache.\n* Query string dependent: Delivers a different resource each time the query string changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge cache \n\nYou can purge your cache to prepare for updates at any time by entering the URL into the purge cache field. You can purge a single file or multiple files (up to 30 at a time).\n\n\n\n\n\n Browser expiration \n\nYou can use the list menu to select the time of browser expiration that you require; for example, 8 hours, or 1 day.\n\nEnterprise only: You can also instruct CIS not to override browser cache control by setting this to Respect Existing Headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using Development mode \n\nDevelopment mode is intended for use when major updates or new file uploads are required, or any time you do not want the end users to work from the cache at all, but to retrieve files directly from the origin servers. To begin using Development Mode, toggle the switch to Enabled position. To stop using Development Mode, toggle the switch to Disabled position. Development mode expires automatically after 3 hours.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04145-3314-5349","score":0.0299107143,"text":"\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain).

In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04625-7-1865","score":0.0158730159,"text":"\nAdding and using a custom domain \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloud Foundry is deprecated and no longer supported as of 1 June 2023.

For example, even if the traffic is not encrypted on the source side, you can specify your own additional TLS encryption for the connection that goes over the internet.\n\nTo review information about how Satellite Link handles each type of connection protocol, see [Encryption protocols](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-link-location-cloudlink-protocols). To review other frequently asked questions about Satellite Link network security, see [External network requirements and security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-link-location-cloudlink-security).\n\n\n\n\n\n What measures can I take to secure user access to data in my location? \n\nReview the

Generally, stateful firewalls are preferred where application traffic is prevalent.\n\nThe Brocade 5400 vRouter does not track the state of the connections with default configuration. The firewall is stateless until one of the following conditions is met:\n\n\n\n* Configuration of a firewall and any rule has a state parameter set\n* Configuration of a firewall state-policy\n* Configuration of NAT\n* Enablement of the transparent web proxy service\n* Enablement of a WAN load-balancing configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Stateless firewalls \n\nA stateless firewall considers every packet in isolation. Packets can be accepted or dropped according to only basic access control list (ACL) criteria, such as the source and destination fields in the IP or Transmission Control Protocols\/User Datagram Protocol (TCP\/UDP) headers. A stateless Brocade 5400 vRouter does not store connection information and has no requirement to look up every packet's relation to previous flows, both of which consume small amounts of memory and CPU time. Therefore, raw forwarding performance is best on a stateless system. Brocade recommends keeping the router stateless for best performance if you do not require the features specific to statefulness.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-adding-firewall-functions-to-vyatta-5400-stateless-and-stateful-"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1006129-1007999","score":0.0317460317,"text":"\n* How can I filter internet-bound traffic and only allow specific protocols and destinations?\n\nThis is a common question when Source NAT and a firewall must be combined.\n\nKeep in mind the order of operations in the VRA you design your rulesets.\n\nIn short, firewall rules are applied after SNAT.\n\nTo block all outgoing traffic in a firewall, but allow specific SNAT flows, you must move the filtering logic onto your SNAT.

A zone consists of one or more network interfaces.\n\n\n\nIt is important to test firewall rules after creation to ensure the rules work as intended and that new rules do not restrict administrative access to the device.\n\nWhile manipulating rules on the dp0bond1 interface, it is advised to connect to the device using dp0bond0. Connecting to the console using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is also an option.\n\n\n\n Stateless vs stateful \n\nBy default, the firewall is stateless, but it can be configured as stateful if needed. A stateless firewall will need rules for traffic in both directions, while stateful firewalls track connections and automatically allow the returning traffic of accepted flows. To configure a stateful firewall, you must dictate which rules you want to operate statefully.\n\nTo enable 'stateful' tracking of tcp, udp, or icmp traffic, run the following commands:\n\nset security firewall global-state-policy icmp\nset security firewall global-state-policy tcp\nset security firewall global-state-policy udp\n\nNote that the global-state-policy commands will only track the state of traffic that has matched a firewall rule which explicitly sets the corresponding protocol. For example:\n\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATELESS rule 1 action accept\n\nAs GLOBAL_STATELESS does not specify protocol tcp, the global-state-policy tcp command would not apply on this rule.\n\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP rule 1 action accept\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP rule 1 protocol tcp\n\nIn this case protocol tcp is explicitly defined.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.0454545455,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time.

Doing so helps to establish a relationship between the intent and entities. It is a weak relationship, but it does inform the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotated mentions \n\nAs you define entities, you can annotate mentions of the entity directly from your existing intent user examples. A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value. And when you add the mention to an existing entity value, it is also added to that entity value as new synonym. Intent classification does use these types of dictionary references in intent user examples to establish a weak reference between an intent and an entity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

These identities are not managed by IBM and the private keys are not stored in the console. They are only stored in your browser local storage. Therefore, make sure to export your identities and the MSP of your organization. If you attempt to access the console from a different machine or a different browser, you will need to import these identities and organization definitions.\n\nTo create the CA that will issue certificates for your first organization, perform the following steps in your console:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Nodes tab on the left and click Add Certificate Authority. The side panels will allow you to customize the CA that you want to create and the organization that this CA will issue keys for.\n2. In this tutorial, we're creating nodes, as opposed to importing them, so make sure the option to Create a Certificate Authority is selected. Then click Next.\n3. Use the side panel to give your CA a display name. Our recommended value for this CA is Org1 CA. Then give your CA admin credentials by specifying a CA administrator enroll ID of admin and a secret of adminpw. Again, these are recommended values.\n4.

I\u2019ll be following the process from the IBM Blockchain platform documentation, which you can see here. At the end of this tutorial, you will have created this structure, representing the components related to org1. In our next video, we\u2019ll create an ordering service. And after that, a channel, to complete the infrastructure of our network.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll be using recommended values for the various fields in the UI. These are the same values you\u2019ll find in the docs, which are cataloged in tables for the various tasks. These values are not mandatory, but if you\u2019re using the console for the first time, we do recommended them. In cases where you have to reenter a value, for example an enroll ID and secret, which are not stored in the console, you will be able to refer to the tables in the documentation to remember what you entered. If you do choose different values, make sure to write them down somewhere.\n\nAlright, so let\u2019s get started creating that peer. If you're unfamiliar with Hyperledger Fabric, which the IBM Blockchain Platform is based on, you might not realize you have to create a Certificate Authority before you create a peer. This is because before we can create a peer, we have to create some identities. These identities allow a network entity, whether it\u2019s an admin or a node, to sign its actions using a certificate. Those certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, also known as a CA. Therefore, our first step in creating a peer is to create a CA and use it to register identities for the peer admin and for the peer itself.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02882-5559-7278","score":0.03125,"text":"\n[More icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/kabob.png) icon.\n\n\n\n* To create a peer node that is checked next if the condition for the existing node is not met, select Add node below.\n* To create a peer node that is checked before the condition for the existing node is checked, select Add node above.\n* To create a child node to the selected node, select Add child node.

And because channels can be created with a subset of the members of a network, channels are also a powerful tool to enable privacy. Only the members of a channel will know about that channel and have access to its ledger, enabling the related business partners who form networks a space to execute deals that only they know about. Whatever the reason, the process for creating a channel is the same.\n\nSince we\u2019re creating a channel, you might be tempted to click over to the channels tab. But there's actually a step we need to do first, which is to add org1 to the consortium. Now what is the consortium? A consortium is the list of organizations that are allowed to create channels on a particular ordering service. Once an organization is added to this list, which is maintained by the admins of the ordering service, an organization will be able to create a channel. To do that, we must click into the Ordering Service and click Add Organization under the Consortium members header. Then we must select the org1msp, as this is our peer organization.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02961-7-1871","score":0.0464015152,"text":"\nDialog building tips \n\nGet tips about ways to address common tasks.\n\n\n\n Adding nodes \n\n\n\n* Add a node name that describes the purpose of the node.\n\nYou currently know what the node does, but months from now you might not.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application.

For example, you might be creating an application that gains insights from medical records. To build the type system, you start looking at patient records to see what kinds of information must be captured. The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system. And in making the decision to make this omission, recognize that this means that sections of your patient record documents will be left unannotated. That is alright and even expected.\n\nMentions annotate a span of text; they do not replace the text. A type system is not an ontology for a domain. Expect to have general entity types such as MEDICATION_NAME instead of having an entity type for each medicine type. The document text will continue to contain the specific medicine name. It will just be enhanced with an annotation that identifies its type, which makes the information easier to find and extract programmatically.\n\nAs you get started, define 10 to 40 entity types and relation types.

For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

(The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03188-4819-6738","score":0.0307692308,"text":"\nFor more information about how to pass data, see [Passing sensitive data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt).\n\nTo access the payload data, you can reference the context.integrations.chat.private.user_payload object from the dialog node condition.\n\nYou must know the structure of the JSON object that is sent in the payload.\n\nFor example, if you passed the value \"mvp:true\" in the JSON payload, you can add a dialog flow that checks for this value to define a response that is meant for VIP customers only.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple. Its simplicity also means it can be misused. That's why it's important to verify that the messages sent to your assistant are coming from authorized users only.\n\nBefore you enable security, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

By default, the embed script automatically uses the latest version of the web chat. To avoid unexpected changes that might affect your website, you might want to control which version of the web chat your website uses, giving you an opportunity to test each new version before you deploy in in production., in order to avoid unexpected changes when a new version is released.\n\nFor more information about web chat versioning, see [Controlling the web chat version](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-versions).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16298-6367-7794","score":0.0289855072,"text":"\nFor more information see [Securing the web chat](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security).\n2. Encrypt sensitive information that you pass to the web chat.\n\nWhen you enable security in Zendesk, you must provide the name and email address of the current user with each request.

As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16380-7-2028","score":0.0289855072,"text":"\nTutorial: Customizing the size and position of the web chat \n\nThis tutorial shows how you can change the size and position of the web chat by rendering it in a custom element.\n\nFor a complete, working version of the example described in this tutorial, see [Custom elements for Watson Assistant web chat](https:\/\/github.com\/watson-developer-cloud\/assistant-toolkit\/tree\/master\/integrations\/webchat\/examples\/custom-element).\n\nBy default, the web chat interface on your website is rendered in a host div element that is styled to appear in a fixed location on the page. If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02855-1612-3501","score":0.0285714286,"text":"\nSets the color of interactive elements, including:\n\n\n\n* Chat launcher button that is embedded in your web page\n* Send button associated with the input text field\n* Input text field border when in focus\n* Marker that shows the start of the assistant\u2019s response\n* Border of a button after it is clicked\n* Border of the drop-down list field as the user chooses an option\n* Typing indicator that is shown to repesent a pause response\n\n\n\n* Assistant image: This image is displayed in the web chat header along with the assistant name to represent your assistant or organization.

For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

For example, you might want the customer to specify a street address, which is easier to communicate accurately in writing than by transcribing voice input.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-voice-actions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":0.0303030303,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.
