The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions. A common table expression permits defining a result table with a table name that can be specified as a table name in any FROM clause of the fullselect that follows.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16353-2640-4846", "score": 0.045454545454545456, "text": "\nYou can select any step that precedes the step you are editing.\n\nNote that only the selected steps will repeat, regardless of their And then settings. Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3. Click Apply.\n\n\n\nAny session variable values that were defined based on choices that the customer made in the repeated steps are cleared and replaced with the new responses.\n\nThere is no option to jump to a later step. Instead of jumping directly to a later step, control the flow through the intervening steps with step conditions or skipping steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n Go to a subaction \n\nAn action that is called from another action is referred to as a subaction. This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it. For example, as part of an action to place an order, you might call a subaction that enables a new customer to create an account.\n\nTo call a subaction:\n\n\n\n1.

Fill out form fields to configure your instance\n\n\n\n Querying Object Storage with SQL Query \n\nYou can use SQL Query to create SELECT statements only; actions such as CREATE, DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE are not possible.\n\nInput data for your queries are read from ORC, CSV, JSON, or Parquet files located in one or more IBM Cloud Object Storage instances. Each query result is written by default to a CSV file in a Cloud Object Storage instance where you created the integration. But you can freely override and customise the format and Object Storage location as part of the SQL statement that you run.\n\nYou can use a custom INTO clause of a SELECT statement to control where and how result data from a SELECT statement is written to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\nGetting started using SQL Query SELECT statements from inside your instance is as easy as creating an integration. Objects of queryable data formats, as well as folders with multiple objects of a consistent queryable format (when shown in the \"folders\" view) are labeled as shown in Figure 4.\n\nZoom\n\n![Object with SQL label](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/63322f2f3a72050206eb05ba7f590fdcb741105c/cloud-object-storage/images/accessible-using-sql.jpg)\n\nFigure 4.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-sql-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13493-2289-4276", "score": 0.043478260869565216, "text": "\n* Use the INTO clause of a [query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterSQLQueryStatement) to specify the output [URI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-runningunique), that is, the location to which the result is to be written and the wanted result format.\n\n\n\n2.

Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore.

For information about use cases for relevancy training, see [Improve your natural language query results from Watson Discovery](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/improving-your-natural-language-query-results-from-watson-discovery/).\n\nTo train Watson, you must provide the following:\n\n\n\n* Example queries that are representative of the queries your users enter\n* Ratings that indicate which results for each query are relevant and not relevant\n\n\n\nAfter Watson has enough training input, the information that you provide about which results are good and bad for each query is used to learn about your collection. Watson does not just memorize, but it also learns from the specific information about individual queries and applies the patterns it detects to all new queries. It does so, using machine-learning Watson techniques that find signals in your content and questions.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore.

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

Also, you can analyze this data by using the robust and massively parallel Netezza Performance Server execution engine.\n\nExternal data sources use connection strings to specify how you can access an external system.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition.

CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00522-2652-4218", "score": 0.03225806451612903, "text": "\nOpen the service instance that you created in the prerequisite section.\n3.

IBM Cloudant isn't using an index to service this query, meaning that the database has to scan every document in the database to get your answer. This scan is fine for small data sets. But if you're running a production application where the data set is expanding all the time, you definitely don't want to rely on unindexed queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nTo create an index, we can tell IBM Cloudant to create an index on the publisher and year fields that we are using in our query.\n\n\n\n1. From the IBM Cloudant Dashboard, select the books database.\n2. Select the Design Documents tab.\n3. Select New Indexes from the Design Documents menu.\n4.

A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-62356-64581", "score": 0.029850746268656716, "text": "\nSometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz.

This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00579-2977-4822", "score": 0.028985507246376812, "text": "\n* IBM Cloudant guide to using [views](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-viewsusing-views)\n* Performance implications of using [include_docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-viewsmulti-document-fetching)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Never rely on the default behavior of IBM Cloudant Query\u2019s no-indexing \n\nIt\u2019s tempting to rely on IBM Cloudant Query's ability to query without creating explicit indexes. This practice is costly in terms of performance, as every lookup is a full scan of the database rather than an indexed lookup. If your data is small, this full-scan lookup doesn\u2019t matter, but as the data set grows, performance becomes a problem for you, and for the cluster as a whole. It is likely that we will limit this facility soon. The IBM Cloudant Dashboard provides a method for creating indexes in an easy way.\n\nCreating indexes and crafting IBM Cloudant Queries that take advantage of them requires some flair. To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index. Some examples exist where this type of indexing is abused either deliberately, or mostly by mistake. Plan your indexing to comprise only the fields required by your actual queries. Indexes take up space and can be costly to rebuild if the number of indexed fields are large.\n\nWe also have the issue of which fields that you store in an IBM Cloudant Search.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00491-1283-3050", "score": 0.02857142857142857, "text": "\n(Optional) [Create an acurl alias](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-working-with-curlencode-user-name-and-password).\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to set up acurl, use the following URL with curl instead of the one provided in the exercises, curl \"https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/databasedemo\".\n\nThe acurl alias is more secure.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}]}

A request can have multiple steps within it, for example I want to order a pizza is a request. Delivery/takeout, Small/Medium/Large, Cheese/Pepperoni/Mushrooms/Peppers are all steps within the request of ordering a pizza.\n\n\n\n\n\n Completion and recognition \n\nThe completion and recognition charts provide information about the actions in your assistant.\n\n![Completion and recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/analytics-completion-recognition-2.png)\n\n\n\n Completion \n\nCompletion is the measurement of how often users are able to successfully get through all steps of an action.\n\nYour assistant measures when someone reaches the final step of an action.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.04838709677419355, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.047619047619047616, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default.

Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04177-7-2309", "score": 0.030303030303030304, "text": "\nManaging your CIS deployment \n\nYou'll begin by using the Overview screen as your working base of operations.

For example, if you upgrade from IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.6 to 4.7, and were using Latest (01-Jun-2022) that version becomes listed as Previous (01 June 2022) and remains your selected version.\n\n\n\n Automatic retraining after upgrading \n\nAfter your Watson Assistant for IBM Cloud Pak for Data upgrade is complete, Watson Assistant performs automatic retraining for any assistant models that were trained using a version that is no longer supported. In this case, Watson Assistant automatically retrains your assistant to the Latest version. This automatic retraining is required to assure your ability to run your trained models in your next upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practices \n\nIt's recommended to use the Latest version in your production deployment of Watson Assistant for IBM Cloud Pak for Data. This is the default for newly-created assistants. During an upgrade, your settings don't automatically switch existing assistants to use the latest version. If prior to your upgrade you had selected Latest, your settings continue to use that version, now labeled as Previous. After you upgrade, it's recommended you choose Latest and run basic regression tests.\n\nIBM performs robust testing on a variety of data sets to minimize impacts on existing assistants. But given the nature of machine learning models and the nuance and subtlety of natural languages processing, you may find some discrepancies from version to version. If you find a major issue through your tests, you have the ability to switch your settings and use Previous to return to the prior behavior. In this event, we recommend you contact IBM and provide details of your test so that that IBM can support you in the steps to resolve the problem.\n\nIt's also recommended that you try the Beta version in one of your test systems after you upgrade. This gives you early visibility to changes that are likely to be delivered in a future version, and will reduce the probability of negative impacts to your production systems. IBM values both positive and negative feedback from customers who use Beta.

If the model performance results are good, you might want to store a version of the component before changing any of the resources. If changes that you make result in poorer quality, you can revert to a version that you stored.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Do not redact the information or replace it wholesale with variables. For best results, replace the real information with fake information of the same type.\n\nFor example, if the PII that you want to protect is client names, then instead of redacting each name or replacing each name with a variable, such as USER_NAME, replace each name with a fake name that uses a variety of typical name syntax styles, such as Jane Doe, Mr. Smith, Dietrich, or Dr. Jones, PhD. Consider writing a script that concatenates a variety of first and last names, and titles and last names, and adds last names alone to create fake names that can be inserted into the document to replace instances of real user names. The goal is to simulate as closely as possible real values in the source documents. If the same text (USER_NAME) is used in the documents or text is redacted, you will basically be training the model to expect all names to have that same value or be redacted. When the model is used at runtime on new documents, and encounters never-seen-before names in all their variability, you want it to be able to recognize them as names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding documents to a workspace \n\nTo train a model, you must add documents that are representative of your domain content to your workspace.\n\n\n\n About this training task \n\nAs a best practice, start with a relatively small collection of documents.

That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test? That works on every other database that you ever used, correct?\n\nNot on IBM Cloudant.\n\nOr rather, it works 99 times out of 100.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-in-practice"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-451250-453592", "score": 0.043478260869565216, "text": "\nAs always, successful modeling involves achieving a balance between ease of use versus the performance characteristics you're hoping to achieve.\n\n(The FAQ for modeling data to scale is based on a blog article by Mike Rhodes, My top five tips for modeling your data to scale.)\n\n\n\nIf you're changing the same piece of state at a rate of once per second or more, consider making your documents immutable.

For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM.

The list starts with the most fundamental concepts.\n\n\n\n Hardware security module \n\nA hardware security module (HSM) is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing. HSMs of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services are FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified, which is the highest level of security for cryptographic hardware. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Crypto units \n\nA crypto unit is a single unit that represents an HSM and the corresponding software stack that is dedicated to the HSM for cryptography. In Hyper Protect Crypto Services, the following types of crypto unit are available:\n\n\n\n* Operational crypto unit", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08462-7-2096", "score": 0.029418126757516764, "text": "\nProtecting your data with envelope encryption - Standard Plan \n\nEnvelope encryption is the practice of encrypting data with a\n\ndata encryption key (DEK)and then wrapping the DEK with aroot keythat you can fully manage.

Describes the benefits of customer-managed encryption\n\n Benefit Description \n\n Customer-managed encryption keys With the service, you can provision root keys to protect the security of your encrypted data in the cloud. Root keys serve as key-wrapping keys, which help you manage and safeguard the data encryption keys (DEKs) provisioned in IBM Cloud data services. You decide whether to [import your existing root keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-import-root-keys), or have Hyper Protect Crypto Services [generate root keys on your behalf](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-root-keys). \n Confidentiality and integrity protection Hyper Protect Crypto Services uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Cipher Blocker Chaining (CBC) mode to create and protect keys. When you create keys in the service, Hyper Protect Crypto Services generates them in the Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance and the master key encrypts the keys to ensure only you have the access. \n Cryptographic shredding of data If your organization detects a security issue, or your application no longer needs a set of data, you can choose to shred the data permanently from the cloud. When you delete a root key that protects other DEKs, you ensure that the keys' associated data can no longer be accessed or decrypted. \n Delegated user access control By assigning Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, Hyper Protect Crypto Services supports a centralized access control system to enable granular access for your keys.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-envelope-encryption"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07982-7-2122", "score": 0.029418126757516764, "text": "\nHandling and securing secrets \n\nA secret is any piece of data that is sensitive within the context of an application or service.

You want to protect your data to help ensure it's secure, available, and maintains integrity. IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae provides several ways to protect your data and help keep your applications operational.\n\nSome of these protection features are automatic. For other forms of protection, IBM Cloudant provides you with supported tools that help you to create your own high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.\n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Service has Business Continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of the Cloud Service within hours if a disaster occurs. You are responsible for your data backup, and associated recovery of your content.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the automatic capabilities and supported tools that are offered by IBM Cloudant.\n\n\n\n Types and levels of protection \n\nThe type of protection you might want depends on the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nFor example, you might want to have a high level of data availability so that you can still access your data, even if a limited amount of hardware within the system failed. This requirement is necessary for \"High Availability\" (HA). It means that you provide the best possible continuous data availability after a hardware failure. Different HA techniques tolerate different levels of failure before operations are affected.\n\nYou might want to have quick and easy ways of backing up and restoring data. For example, after a severe or extensive hardware failure, you want the ability to make all the data available on an alternative system as quickly as possible. This requirement is necessary for \"Disaster Recovery\" (DR). A disaster generally means that a database is no longer available in one or more locations. For example, a power outage might cause all systems in a database cluster to fail. Or a large-scale network failure might mean systems in a cluster can't be contacted, even though they continue to work correctly.\n\nAddressing your HA or DR requirements often begins by simplifying the problem into more generic requirements. When you identify your requirements, you can apply the tools and features that help solve the generic needs. Together, the tools and features can address your HA or DR requirements.\n\nDifferent tools and features provide different levels of protection. The different features might be more or less suitable for your specific HA or DR requirement.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backup"}]}

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb/vpc/images/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14916-7-2291", "score": 0.032018442622950824, "text": "\nOverview \n\nUse IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud to create your own space in IBM Cloud\u00ae. A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-187656-189537", "score": 0.03200204813108039, "text": "\nA Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides network isolation and security in the IBM Cloud.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

Those pushes were automated with open toolchains and IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery. No longer were updates to the HR site languishing in slow, error-prone build processes. They can deliver incremental updates to their site, daily or even more frequently. Moreover, logging and monitoring for the HR site is rapidly integrated, especially for how the site pulls personalized data from back-end benefit systems. Developers don\u2019t waste time building complex logging systems, just to be able to troubleshoot live systems. Developers don't need to become experts in cloud security, they can enforce policy driven authentication easily by using IBM Cloud App ID.\n\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the HR site, they could easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15160-7105-8981", "score": 0.01639344262295082, "text": "\nUnder Optional, you can configure two options.\n\n\n\n* Fast snapshot restore - When you enable this feature, you must specify the zone or zones where you want [fast restore](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-aboutsnapshots_vpc_fast_restore) enabled.

Multiple instances of App Configuration within a single environment are all considered separate application instances, as are individual App Configuration instances in multiple environments (such as test, development, staging, or production).\n\nA single instance of App Configuration can serve multiple environments, and in fact the service is designed to do so.\n\nActive Entity ID - An active entity ID is a unique identifier for each entity that interacts with the App Configuration service. For example, an entity might be an instance of an app that runs on a mobile device, a microservice that runs on the cloud, or a component of infrastructure that runs that microservice. For any entity to interact with App Configuration, it must provide a unique entity ID. This task is most easily accomplished by programming your app or microservice to send the Entity ID by using the App Configuration SDK.\n\nAPI Call - An API call is the invocation of the App Configuration through a programmable interface.\n\nExactly what constitutes an API call varies depending on the entity type (for example, a microservice or a mobile app). For server-side entities like microservices, when the state of a feature flag or property changes in the App Configuration, a websocket connection notifies the SDK in the microservice that a state change occurred. The microservice then calls back into the App Configuration to retrieve the update. This action is an API call.\n\nAn API call also occurs on startup to the retrieve the initial configuration state. For client-side entities like mobile apps, websockets are not used. Instead, an API call fetches the current configuration state when a user opens the app, or brings it to the foreground.

To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.\n* What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?\n\nReaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.\n\nYou can check your usage by going to Manage > Billing and usage in the IBM Cloud console, and selecting Usage.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize).

You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view.

If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise.

For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted.

Also, some recommendations are not scored, and don't impact the overall benchmark score.\n\nNext, decide whether the component falls within your responsibility.

Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system.

This strategy includes workloads in both the private cloud and multiple external cloud environments, such as the public cloud or a cloud managed by a service provider. Most enterprises are also faced with the challenge of protecting an ever-increasing attack surface while simultaneously maintaining compliance with industry and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nTo protect this expanding attack surface, enterprises need continuous visibility into workloads from the start until the end of their lifecycle. Enterprises must maintain a \u201cfull-stack\u201d understanding of the workload vulnerabilities and configuration issues at the infrastructure, platform, and application level in the context of threats and compliance requirements. Enterprises need predictive analytics to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d to give a proactive view of their cyberrisk and compliance risk posture in this vast, new hybrid world.\n\nCaveonix RiskForesight\u2122 provides proactive workload protection from risks due to cyberthreats and regulatory compliance issues. It provides real-time visibility into what is running in an enterprise\u2019s hybrid cloud through native integration into cloud orchestration platforms. Combining such visibility with risk reduction models and enforcement actions that can be automated, RiskForesight quickly develops a prioritized list of actions to mitigate. RiskForesight is a multitenant-aware hybrid cloud workload protection platform that implements a proactive risk management framework. This framework can operate at multiple control planes: network, compute, security, and compliance, while the implementation of the framework at cloud scale is automated.\n\nThe platform is fully integrated into the VMware\u00ae technology stack from vCD, vRA, vCenter to NSX and many public clouds. The RiskForesight platform has three key modules: Detect, Predict, and Act, providing 360-degree visibility into hybrid cloud workloads in real time by natively integrating into hybrid cloud orchestration modules.

A set of IAM credentials consists of a service ID and an API key that is generated each time that the protected resource is read or accessed. You can define a time-to-live (TTL) or a lease duration for your IAM credential at its creation so that you shorten the amount of time that the secret exists.\n\nTo learn more about the types of secrets that you can manage in Secrets Manager, see [What is a secret?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret)\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you get started, be sure that you have the required level of access. To create or add secrets, you need the [Writer service role or higher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam).\n\nIAM credentials require an extra configuration step before you can start to create or manage them in the service. For more information, see [Configuring the IAM credentials engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-configure-iam-engine).\n\nAn account administrator (or any entity with the required level of access) can externally alter IAM Credentials that are created and managed by Secrets Manager. If such a service ID or API key is deleted outside of Secrets Manager, the service might behave unexpectedly. For example, you might be unable to create, or rotate credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating IAM credentials in the UI \n\nTo create IAM credentials by using the Secrets Manager UI, complete the following steps.\n\n\n\n1.

From the Resource list page, select the name of the service to open the service details page. Then, select the Credentials tab, and click New Credential.\n2. From the Add New Credential dialog, provide a Name.\n3. Specify the role. This value sets the IAM service access role. For more information, see [IAM Access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).\n4. Optionally, you can provide a Service ID by either allowing IAM to generate a unique value for you, or by providing an existing Service ID.

Credentials are service-specific and vary based on how each service defines the credentials they need to generate. A credential might contain a user name, password, host name, port, and a URL.\n\nHowever, while the contents of each credential is unique to the service that generates it, all services managed by IAM require that new credentials include an IAM Service access role. Some services might generate more data that requires parameters to be passed in. For example, a service might require you to input a language parameter to set the default language that is returned in the resource key that is generated.\n\nTo create a resource key, call the [Resource Controller API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controllercreate-resource-key) as shown in the following example:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Python\n* Go\n* Node", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials&interface=ui"}]}

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00029-8568-9861", "score": 0.03149801587301587, "text": "\n\"spark.hive.metastore.client.auth.mode\":\"PLAIN\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.use.SSL\":\"true\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.stats.autogather\":\"false\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.client.plain.username\":\"<CHANGEME-CRN-DATA-ENGINE-INSTANCE>\",\n for spark 3.3\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"/opt/ibm/jdk/lib/security/cacerts\",\n for spark 3.1, spark 3.2\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"file:///opt/ibm/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars\":\"/opt/ibm/connectors/data-engine/hms-client/\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.version\":\"3.0\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\":\"file:///tmp\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hadoop.metastore.catalog.default\":\"spark\"\n},\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"application\": \"cos://mybucket.ALIAS NAME/select_query_data_engine.py\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n}\nShow more\n\nParameter values:\n\n\n\n* ALIAS NAME: specify the data engine endpoint for your region.

For example, you might need to migrate data from old instances to new instances or update the credentials that are used for your app if you delete the Cloud Foundry alias.

By default, the service does no keyword spotting.\n\nTo use keyword spotting, you must specify both of the following parameters:\n\n\n\n* Use the keywords parameter to specify an array of strings to be spotted. The service spots no keywords if you omit the parameter or specify an empty array. A keyword string can include more than one token. For example, the keyword Speech to Text has three tokens. Keyword matching is case-insensitive, so Speech to Text is effectively equivalent to speech to text.\n\nFor US English, the service normalizes each keyword to match spoken versus written strings. For example, it normalizes numbers to match how they are spoken as opposed to written. For other languages, keywords must be specified as they are spoken.\n* Use the keywords_threshold parameter to specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0 for a keyword match. The threshold indicates the lower bound for the level of confidence the service must have for a word to match the keyword. A keyword is spotted in the transcript only if its confidence is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.\n\nSpecifying a small threshold can potentially produce many matches.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API.

This simplified model is based on the amount of CPU (or VPC) that your IBM Blockchain Platform nodes are allocated on an hourly basis, at a flat rate of $0.29 USD/VPC-hour.\n\nA VPC is a unit of measurement that is used to determine the licensing cost of IBM products. It is based on the number of virtual cores (vCPUs) that are available to the product. A vCPU is a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual machine or a physical processor core. For IBM Blockchain Platform cost estimation purposes, 1 VPC = 1 CPU = 1 vCPU = 1 Core. The term \"VPC\" is also used to refer to a type of infrastructure on IBM Cloud and is unrelated to this topic.\n\nFor a total cost estimate, remember that your blockchain network consists of an Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud that contains IBM Blockchain Platform components and uses storage of your choice.

Keep in mind that you are responsible for additional charges and how these services operate in your cluster, from deployment and maintenance to integration with your apps. If you have issues with an operator or third-party integration, work with the appropriate provider to troubleshoot the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n VPC worker nodes \n\nPricing for VPC infrastructure varies based on regional location and sustained usage.\n\nThis information applies to VPC worker nodes only.\n\nRegional uplift charges\n: When you create a cluster on VPC infrastructure, the worker nodes might incur an uplift charge that varies by the [multizone location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zoneszones-vpc) that you create the cluster in. The uplift charge is a percentage (%) of the hourly rate (r), and is added to the hourly rate of the worker node. The total hourly rate cost for a worker node can be calculated as r + (r \u00d7 %). In the [Kubernetes cluster creation console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create), this uplift is reflected in the pricing calculator as you configure your cluster details. The following table describes the pricing uplift by region.\n: For a table that describes the pricing uplift by region, see [Regional pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs).\n\nSustained usage discounts\n: For virtual server instances that are billed at an hourly rate, discounted prices depend on how long the instance runs during the billing month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-costs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10096-4020-5943", "score": 0.015873015873015872, "text": "\nServices that don't use resource groups like IBM Cloud Container Registry or that don't need service binding like IBM Log Analysis work even if the cluster is in a different resource group.\n* Consider giving clusters unique names across resource groups and regions in your account to avoid naming conflicts.

Classic clusters only: Consider [creating a reservation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-reservations) to lock in a discount over 1 or 3 year terms for your worker nodes. After you create the cluster, add worker pools that use the reserved instances. Typical savings range between 30-50% compared to regular worker node costs.\n6. VPC clusters only: Set up your IBM Cloud infrastructure networking to allow worker-to-master and user-to-master communication. Your VPC clusters are created with a public and a private cloud service endpoint by default. Optional: If you want your VPC clusters to communicate with classic clusters over the private network interface, you can choose to set up classic infrastructure access from the VPC that your cluster is in.

They are symmetric key-wrapping keys that are used as roots of trust for protecting other keys that are stored in a data service with [envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\nWith Key Protect, you can create, store, and manage the lifecycle of root keys to achieve full control of other keys stored in the cloud.\n\nAfter a root key has been created, neither a user nor IBM can see its key material.\n* What is a data encryption key (DEK)?\n\nA DEK is a key used by services like IBM Cloud Object Storage service to perform IBM-managed AES256 encryption of the data stored in the cloud object storage. The DEK keys are randomly generated and stored securely with the cloud object storage service near the resources they encrypt. The DEK is used for default encryption in all cases regardless of whether the customer wants to manage the encryption keys or not. The ICOS DEK is not managed by clients nor do they need to rotate it. For cases where clients do want to manage the encryption, they indirectly control the DEK by wrapping the DEK with their own \"root key\" stored in their Key Protect instance. A root key can be generated or imported, and managed by you in your Key Protect instance (for example, by rotating keys).\n\nKey Protect can generate DEKs (which wraps keys without passing plaintext) through its HSM.\n* What is envelope encryption?\n\nEnvelope encryption is the practice of encrypting data with a data encryption key, and then encrypting the data encryption key with a highly secure key-wrapping key.

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions. This is typically defined as a DR architecture.\n\nThe benefits of using a [DR orchestrator](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-cloud-resiliency-orchestrator) are covered in the context of a cloud environment and its fast changing behavior. You might require several integrations with management tools and services in IBM Cloud\u00ae.

We recommend that you verify possible changes or additional features that might apply to your environment.\n\n\n\n General disaster recovery strategy \n\nThe approach to defining your DR strategy needs to be systematic and start with the application or service, which is defined as a set of compute resources, for example Kubernetes apps, virtual machines, services, and more, that make up a business application.\n\nWhile a holistic approach might be wanted, the reality is that each business application (cloud service) is independent, with its own", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-dr"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07502-5502-7788", "score": 0.015625, "text": "\nThe disaster recovery kit is an off-site and protected repository that includes hardware, software, and system secure configurations, one-time keys, and the disaster recovery plan.

If you identify the user interaction with a session_id, then it counts as three uses (because there is a separate session that is created for each interaction).\n\nDesign any custom applications to capture a unique user_id or session_id and pass the information to Watson Assistant. Choose a non-human-identifiable ID that doesn't change throughout the customer lifecycle. For example, don't use a person's email address as the user ID. In fact, the user_id syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230section-3.2).\n\nThe built-in integrations derive the user ID in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* For Facebook integrations, the user_id property is set to the sender ID that Facebook provides in its payload.\n* For Slack integrations, the user_id property is a concatenation of the team ID, such as T09LVDR7Y, and the member ID of the user, such has W4F8K9JNF. For example: T09LVDR7YW4F8K9JNF.\n* For web chat, you can set the value of the user_id property.\n\n\n\nBilling is managed per monthly active user per service instance.

Your assistant remembers this information, and other information about a conversation, as variables. Your assistant can use variables to provide a more personalized and customized experience, and to get users quickly to the solutions they need.\n\nVariables are a powerful tool that you can use to build a better assistant. Variables make possible all of the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* Personalization. The best virtual assistant experiences are targeted and personalized for each customer. When an assistant greets a customer by saying \"Hello, Frank! Welcome back,\" it tells Frank that it remembers his name and that it has talked to him before. By storing this kind of information in variables and then referencing them in your assistant's output, you can personalize the conversation and help your assistant seem more human.\n* Acceleration. Over the course of a conversation, your customers answer questions and make choices. These customer responses are stored as variables, which your assistant can then use to guide a conversation. By choosing the right steps and not wasting your customers' time, you can get them as quickly as possible to the right solution.\n* Modularity. Some information might be useful for many different purposes (for example, a customer's current account balance or contact information). Rather than retrieving or recalculating this information in multiple locations, you can do so once, by using a variable to store the result and then access it wherever you need it.\n\n\n\nA variable is simply a named container for a piece of information; by referencing this container by name, your assistant can store or retrieve the information at run time. For example, a variable that is called account_balance might store your customer's current account balance, a value your assistant can update or retrieve as needed.\n\nThe data that is stored by a variable is characterized by the type of data that it contains, such as text, a numeric value, a date, or even a list of multiple values. The operations that you can perform with a variable vary depending on its data type.\n\n\n\n Action variables and session variables \n\nWatson Assistant supports two categories of variables:\n\n\n\n* Action variables: When a step collects information from the customer, the customer response is automatically stored in an action variable.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info"}]}

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

In subscription billing, you purchase a subscription for an amount of credit to spend during the subscription term, and usage is deducted from the subscription credit at a discounted rate. The Enterprise Savings Plan billing model is similar to subscription billing. You commit to spend a certain amount on IBM Cloud and receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount.\n\nThe account that you use to create the enterprise must be a [Subscription account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accountssubscription-account) or an account with the [Enterprise Savings Plan billing model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-committed-use). After the enterprise is created, you can add more accounts to the enterprise. If you add a Lite or trial account, the account is automatically upgraded to a Pay-As-You-Go account.\n\nSome Pay-As-You-Go accounts can't be directly imported into an enterprise, such as many Pay-As-You-Go accounts that are billed in United States dollars (USD). However, you can still import these accounts into your enterprise by converting them to Subscription accounts and then importing them. To convert an account, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule).\n\nEach enterprise supports only a single billing currency. All accounts must use the enterprise billing currency before you add them to the enterprise. Existing accounts that are imported into the enterprise no longer separately manage their billing.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10906-20682-22396", "score": 0.043478260869565216, "text": "\nLearn more about [Enterprise Savings Plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-committed-use) and [Managing subscriptions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions). \n <br><br> * View invoices and build your own reports<br><br><br> To manage and view your invoices, visit the [Invoices](https://cloud.ibm.com/billing/invoices) page from the billing and usage dashboard in the IBM Cloud console.

Data centers across multiple locations provide resilience in the case of a geographic failure and bring workloads closer to globally distributed users, which reduces latency and increases perceived performance. The IBM Cloud network enables users to link workloads hosted in secure private networks across data centers and locations. Use the following checklist to review the available options and to connect your existing on-premises environments to IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\nTable 5.

For more information, see [Enterprise Savings Plan billing model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-committed-use).\n\n\n\n\n\n Subscription account \n\nSubscription accounts offer many of the same benefits as Pay-As-You-Go accounts, including access to the full IBM Cloud catalog and the ability to create multiple resource groups. In addition, Subscription accounts provide discounts for platform services and support and more consistent billing through subscriptions. You can also [set up spending notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending) to get notified when your account or a particular service reaches a specific spending threshold that you set.\n\nWhen you purchase a subscription, you commit to a minimum spending amount for a certain period of time and receive a discount on the overall cost. For example, if you commit to spend $1,000 a month for 6 months, you might get a 5% discount. For the duration of the subscription, you get $6,000 of usage but pay only $5,700 for it. The larger the subscription, the better the discount.\n\nLarge organizations and other users with large cloud workloads can benefit from the savings and predictable billing that are provided by subscriptions. IBM Cloud offers multiple types of subscriptions to fit your usage needs.\n\nA subset of subscription accounts are eligible for the new Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

That trend amount of $1043.75 USD is the predicted next month's usage, with the following calculations:\n\n\n\n* Change between August and July = $1012.50 - $1000.00 = $12.50 USD\n* Change between July and June = $1000.00 - $950.00 = $50.00 USD\n* Average change (trend) = ($12.50 + $50.00) / 2 = $31.25 USD\n\n\n\nAugust usage ($1012.50) + Average change ($31.25) = The predicted usage for next month September ($1043.75 USD)\n\n\n\n\n\n Viewing usage details from the usage page \n\nIn the Services section, you can view a list of your services and the estimated costs that are associated with those services.

Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

For example, if it's August, predicted usage is calculated based on usage trends in June, July, and August to find the predicted usage for September.\n\nLet's say the usage is $950.00 USD for June, $1000.00 USD for July, and $1012.50 USD for August. The difference is calculated between the current month and the last month, and last month and the month before that. Then, the two calculations are averaged to find the trend. That trend amount of $1043.75 USD is the predicted next month's usage, with the following calculations:\n\n\n\n* Change between August and July = $1012.50 - $1000.00 = $12.50 USD\n* Change between July and June = $1000.00 - $950.00 = $50.00 USD\n* Average change (trend) = ($12.50 + $50.00) / 2 = $31.25 USD\n\n\n\nAugust usage ($1012.50) + Average change ($31.25) = The predicted usage for next month September ($1043.75 USD)\n\n\n\n\n\n Viewing usage details from the usage page \n\nIn the Services section, you can view a list of your services and the estimated costs that are associated with those services.

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

For more information about tokens and how they're used in App ID, see [Understanding tokens](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-tokens).\n\nBy customizing your token configuration, you can ensure that your security and user experience needs are met.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region.

You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region.

A database prioritizing consistency and availability is simple: a single node stores a single copy of your data. But this model is difficult to scale as you must upgrade the node to get more performance, rather than use extra nodes. And, even a minor system failure can shut down a single-node system, while any message loss means significant data loss. To endure, the system must become more sophisticated.\n\n\n\n Tradeoffs in partition tolerance \n\nA database that prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance commonly employs a primary-secondary setup, where one node of the many in the system is elected leader. Only the leader approves data writes, while all secondary nodes replicate data from the leader to handle reads. If the leader loses connection to the network, or can't communicate with many of the system's nodes, the remainder elects a new leader. This election process differs between systems, and might be a source of [significant problems](https://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb).\n\nIBM Cloudant prioritizes availability and partition tolerance by employing a primary-primary setup, such that every node can accept both writes and reads to its portion of your data. Multiple nodes include copies of each portion of your data. Each node copies data with other nodes. If a node becomes inaccessible, others can serve in its place while the network heals. This way, the system returns your data in a timely manner despite arbitrary node failure, and maintains [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). The tradeoff in deprioritizing absolute consistency is that it takes time for all nodes to see the same data. As a result, some responses might include old data while the new data propagates through the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing the approach \n\nMaintaining one consistent view of data is logical and easy to understand because a relational database does this work for you. The expectation is that web-based services that interact with database systems behave in this way. But that expectation doesn't mean that they do work this way. Consistency isn't a given, and it takes a little work to change the approach.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theorem"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03406-34893-35432", "score": 0.015873015873015872, "text": "\nIn this tutorial you tested a node with slots and made changes that optimize how it interacts with real users.

This is a prerequisite for high availability groups on Windows servers.\n* External - Uses an external cluster manager. For example, SQL Server on Linux supports Pacemaker. Availability groups on Linux clusters require at least two synchronous replicas to guarantee HA, but at least three replicas for automatic recovery, so it is recommend that an availability group is setup on at least three nodes.\n* None - Known as clusterless availability groups or was initially referred to as a read-scale availability group. However, this option provides only a subset of availability groups features, and does not include automatic failover. The features do include manual planned and forced failover and both synchronous and asynchronous replication modes, readable secondary nodes, and secondary replica backups. Availability groups without a WSFC cluster can still provide readable secondary nodes, read-only routing, and load balancing. Failover can be automated with external tools.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01415-6473-8616", "score": 0.04477611940298507, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Billing for storage and pull traffic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_billing_traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can images from other registries be scanned? \n\nVulnerability Advisor scans images from IBM Cloud Container Registry only.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is a Vulnerability Advisor scan triggered? \n\nFor more information about how the scanning of an image is triggered, see [Vulnerable packages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index&interface=uipackages).\n\n\n\n\n\n Why doesn't a new image scan? \n\nIf you get the vulnerability report immediately after you add the image to the\n\nregistry, you might receive the following error:\n\nBXNVA0009E: <imagename> has not been scanned.

Try again later.\nIf this issue persists, contact support for help;\nsee https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-supportgetting-customer-support\n\nYou receive this message because the images are scanned asynchronously to the requests for results, and the scanning process takes a while to complete. During normal operation, the scan completes within the first few minutes after you add the image to the registry. The time that it takes to complete depends on variables like the image size and the amount of traffic that the registry is receiving.\n\nIf you get this message as part of a build pipeline and you see this error regularly, try adding some retry logic that contains a short pause.\n\nIf you still see unacceptable performance, contact support, see [Getting help and support for Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-help-and-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n How often are the security notices updated? \n\nSecurity notices for Vulnerability Advisor are loaded from the vendors' operating system sites approximately every 12 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why can I see a vulnerability in Vulnerability Advisor v4 but not in v3? \n\nSome vulnerabilities are picked up earlier by Vulnerability Advisor version 4 than by version 3 because version 4 uses a different architecture and a different scanning engine.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faq&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09410-1574-3779", "score": 0.03036576949620428, "text": "\n* IBM Cloud Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM.\n* The IBM Cloud Container Registry includes Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\n\n\nTo get details about the logging agent images, see [Getting information about logging agent images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-log_analysis_agent_image).\n\n\n\n Resource Limits for agents deployed on Kubernetes \n\nThe agent is deployed as a Kubernetes DaemonSet, creating one pod for each node selected. The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

For more information, see [Setting up Secrets Manager in your Kubernetes Service cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Image and registry \n\nEvery deployment is based on an image that holds the instructions for how to spin up the container that runs your app. These instructions include the operating system inside the container and extra software that you want to install. To protect your app, you must protect the image and establish checks to ensure the image's integrity.\n\nShould I use a public or a private registry to store my images?\n: Public registries, such as Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker images and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}]}

For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-71418-73421", "score": 0.03076923076923077, "text": "\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry provides a multi-tenant private image registry that you can use to store and share your container images with users in your IBM Cloud account.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-06-02\n\n\n\n[Encrypting images for content confidentiality](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_encrypt)Encrypting images for content confidentiality\n\nYou can protect the confidentiality of your IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry images, and ensure that hosts that aren't trusted can't run the images.\n\nKey Protect Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-01-25\n\n\n\n[Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iam_access)Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out how to grant access to your resources by configuring IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM) for IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.\n\nContainer Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-01-31\n\n\n\n[Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_tutorial_workflow)Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out about the basic functions of both IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-06-19\n\n\n\n[Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-opbundle-tutorial)Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry\n\nThis tutorial walks you through how to onboard a sample Operator bundle from a Red Hat\u00ae registry to your account.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret. For more information about image pull secrets, see [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).\n\n\n\n Types of image registries \n\nImages are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry).\n\nPublic registries, such as public Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker and Code Engine to create your first application or job. But when it comes to enterprise workloads, use a private registry, such as the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users. For private registries, use registry secrets to ensure that the credentials are available to gain access to the private registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 0.04838709677419355, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 0.047619047619047616, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 0.046153846153846156, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred.

However, data can repeat across objects.

This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

The next part is called The Document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Document video \n\nLearn about IBM Cloudant databases and documents work.\n\n\n\n* The Document video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 2 - The IBM Cloudant Document.\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that IBM Cloudant is a JSON document store. Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00510-7123-9213", "score": 0.01639344262295082, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate. For more information, see the following websites:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant docs on [attachments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments)\n* Detaching IBM Cloudant attachments to [Object Storage](https://medium.com/codait/detaching-cloudant-attachments-to-object-storage-with-serverless-functions-99b8c3c77925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fewer databases are better than many \n\nIf you can, limit the number of databases per IBM Cloudant account to 500 or fewer. While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run. As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07132-3199-5135", "score": 0.01639344262295082, "text": "\n* The following file types can be ingested by Discovery, all other document types are ignored:\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans Advanced plans \n\n PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, JSON*, HTML* PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, PNG**, TIFF**, JPG**, JSON*, HTML* \n\n\n\n* JSON and HTML documents are supported by IBM Watson\u2122 Discovery, but can not be edited using the SDU editor.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00556-10831-12062", "score": 0.015625, "text": "\nThe content must be provided by using [BASE64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) representation, as shown in the example.\n\nA full list of media types is available in the [media types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_typeList_of_common_media_types) article.\n\nSee the following example JSON document that includes an inline attachment of a jpeg image:\n\n{\n\"_id\":\"document_with_attachment\",\n\"_attachments\":\n{\n\"name_of_attachment\": {\n\"content_type\":\"image/jpeg\",\n\"data\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAA... ...AASUVORK5CYII=\"\n}\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Performance considerations \n\nWhile document attachments are useful, they do have implications for application performance. In particular, having too many attachments can have an adverse performance impact during replication.\n\nFor example, if your application requires storage for multiple images as attachments or includes large images, you must use an alternative [BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object) storage mechanism to store the images. You might then use IBM Cloudant to keep the image metadata, such as URLs to the BLOB store.\n\nYou might find it helpful to do performance testing for your specific application to determine which approach works best for your circumstances.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-6386-8382", "score": 0.015625, "text": "\nIt has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database. You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant. We could decide to add the \"address\" object only to the following documents:\n\n\n\n* Documents that are created from now on.\n* Only documents that we have addresses for.\n\n\n\nIn other words, documents of the same type can have fields present or missing.\n\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}]}

When the volume is canceled, the request is followed by a 24-hour reclaim wait period. You can still see the volume in the console during those 24 hours. Billing for the volume stops immediately. When the reclaim period expires, the data is destroyed and the volume is removed from the console, too.\n* Measuring IOPS\n\nIOPS is measured based on a load profile of 16-KB blocks with random 50 percent reads and 50 percent writes.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly. Deleting an IBM Cloudant document leaves a tombstone document behind, so don't rely on deleting documents to recover disk space. Instead, you must rely on deleting whole databases.\n\nJSON doesn't offer a native way to store dates or timestamps.

You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant).

Capacity metrics\n\n Metric Description \n\n Reads per second The rate when simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its _id, or querying against a partitioned database that uses a partition key. \n Writes per second The rate when data is written to the database. API calls dealing with document creation, update, or deletion count as \"writes\". \n Global Queries per second The rate when the database is queried by global indices, typically by accessing the _find endpoint, secondary MapReduce, or search indices. \n Storage The amount of disk space occupied by your JSON data, attachments, and secondary indices. \n\n\n\nAs an example, the Lite plan offers 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB of storage for free. This plan is ideal when you're evaluating the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users.

These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Do take some time to define a set of relation types and their allowable entity type pairs so that relation type needs are taken into consideration before the entity type inventory is finalized.\n\nExpect the type system to evolve with the experience of people trying to annotate to it. If you revise the type system after you create human annotation tasks, you must decide whether to apply the changes to each task. If you apply the changes, human annotators will have to revisit the documents that they annotated previously.\n\nWhen you test the model, you can review statistics that show how frequently the entity types and relation types occur in your sample documents.

An inode is a data structure that contains information about files. Volumes have both private and public inodes. Public inodes are used for files that are visible to the customer and private inodes are used for files that are used internally by the storage system. The maximum number of files setting is 2 billion. However, this maximum value can be configured only with volumes of 7.8 TB or larger. The maximum number of inodes that can be configured on a volume is calculated by taking the total allocated volume size in KB and dividing it by 4.

When the volume is canceled, the request is followed by a 24-hour reclaim wait period. You can still see the volume in the console during those 24 hours. Billing for the volume stops immediately.

Said differently, two hosts connected to a volume with 6000 IOPS share that 6000 IOPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the volume need to be pre-warmed to achieve expected throughput? \n\nPre-warming is not needed. You can observe the specified throughput immediately upon provisioning the volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can more throughput be achieved if a faster Ethernet connection is used? \n\nThroughput limits are set at a per-volume level. That limit cannot be increased by using a faster Ethernet connection. However, with a slower Ethernet connection, your bandwidth can be a potential bottleneck.\n\n\n\n\n\n Do firewalls and security groups impact performance? \n\nIt's best to run storage traffic on a VLAN, which bypasses the firewall.

The human annotator annotates the documents in the annotation set. To later use inter-annotator scores to compare the annotations that are added by each human annotator, you must assign at least two human annotators to different annotation sets. You must also specify that some percentage of documents overlap between the sets.\n\n> Note: In a realistic scenario, you would create as many annotation sets as needed, based on the number of human annotators who are working in the workspace. In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 0.04838709677419355, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-1659-3917", "score": 0.047619047619047616, "text": "\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03353-5263-7331", "score": 0.030303030303030304, "text": "\nItalian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English. All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing a skill language \n\nOnce a skill has been created, its language cannot be modified. If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel).

PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development).

Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle. Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information.

The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy).

Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system development life cycle activities.

Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system.

For example, allowing backend subnets inbound on dp0bond0 would be less work than allowing backend subnets outbound toward each VLAN virtual interface.\n\n\n\n Per-interface firewall rules \n\nOne method for configuring the firewall on a VRA is to apply firewall rule sets to each interface. In this case an interface can be a dataplane interface (dp0s0) or a virtual interface (dp0bond0.303).

You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02877-11543-13181", "score": 0.03076923076923077, "text": "\nYou can apply the indexOf method to the array of intents generated each time user input is evaluated to determine the array index number of a specific intent.\n\nintents.indexOf(\"General_Greetings\")\n\nIf you want to know the confidence score for a specific intent, you can pass the prior expression in as the index value to an expression with the syntax intents[index].confidence.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03126-5596-6966", "score": 0.03225806451612903, "text": "\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "score": 0.03076923076923077, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

Instead of trying to prompt the customer for each piece of information and transcribe it properly, your assistant can switch to SMS text messaging.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03233-4448-6123", "score": 0.029850746268656716, "text": "\nAs the dialog asks for and gets information from the user, it can keep track of the information and reference it later in the conversation.\n\nFor example, in one node you might ask users for their name, and in a later node address them by name.\n\n![Shows an introductions node that asks the user for their name, and stores it as a context variable.

Curation adds value to data; it transforms data into trusted information and knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n Ground truth generation \n\nThis stage refers to the use of Knowledge Studio tools and best practices to produce a collection of vetted data that can be used to adapt a Watson solution to a particular domain. The accuracy of this vetted data, called ground truth or gold standard documents, is critical because inaccuracies in the ground truth will correlate to inaccuracies in the applications that rely on it.\n\nAn essential part of teaching Watson about a new domain involves providing it with knowledge about entities of interest in your domain content, the relationships between them, and how the entities co-reference each other. Collecting this knowledge includes the following activities:\n\n\n\n* Involving domain subject matter experts to create the following resources, or to identify existing resources that can be re-used or modified for your domain:\n\n\n\n* Annotation guidelines and examples to help human annotators learn how words and passages in your domain content are to be annotated.\n* Type systems that define the domain-specific types (objects) and features (data classifications) that can be discovered in your domain content through text analysis.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application.

The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-7-2041", "score": 0.046875, "text": "\nIntegrating the web chat with your website \n\nAdd your assistant to your company website as a web chat widget that can help your customers with common questions and tasks.\n\nWhen you create a web chat integration, code is generated that calls a script that is written in JavaScript.

For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat. This can be either a generated unique identifier (for anonymous users) or an authenticated user ID.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16385-7-2272", "score": 0.031746031746031744, "text": "\nOverview: Securing the web chat \n\nIf you enable security, you can configure the web chat to authenticate users, protect private data, and restrict access to your assistant.\n\nAll messages that are sent between the web chat and the assistant are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), which protects sensitive data as it travels through the network. However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03180-5630-7213", "score": 0.03125, "text": "\nEnabling visitor authentication also enables support for cross-domain traffic and cross-browser identification.

In this expanded state, a customer can still click the launcher to open the web chat. (If the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page before the launcher has expanded, the 15-second timer restarts.)\n\nThe appearance of this expanded state differs slightly depending on whether the customer is using a desktop browser or a mobile browser:\n\n\n\n* For desktop browsers, the expanded launcher shows two primary buttons the customer can click to open the web chat, and a Close button that closes the launcher.\n\n![An example of the desktop launcher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/desktop-launcher.png)\n\nThe expanded launcher remains in its expanded state even if the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page. It stays in its expanded state until the customer either opens it by clicking on either of the two primary buttons, or closes it, at which point it returns to its initial small state for the rest of the session.\n* For mobile browsers, the launcher shows only a single primary button.\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.029411764705882353, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat.

By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

Similarly, you might want to display a form after the web chat closes (for example, a customer satisfaction survey). You can use the same approach for either situation.\n\nWhen the web chat is opened or closed, it fires an [event](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-events) that you can subscribe to. In your event handler, you can use the [custom panels](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-rendercustompanel) feature to open a panel with custom content.\n\nBy returning a promise that is resolved when the custom panel closes, you can pause the process of opening or closing the web chat until after the customer completes the form.\n\nThis example shows how to create a pre-chat form.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16368-7-2072", "score": 0.047162673392181595, "text": "\nWeb chat development overview \n\nIf you are comfortable with JavaScript code, you can customize and extend the web chat by using the web chat API.

Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered.

The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

For example, you must keep up with browser support changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and design the layout and styling. The time you spend designing and maintaing a UI can be better spent building a quality assistant instead. When you use the web chat integration, you can rely on us to manage the user interface, so you can focus on designing conversational exchanges that address the unique business needs of your customers. Cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research is incorporated into the web chat to deliver an exceptional user experience.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy the web chat, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Global audience support", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basics"}]}

For more information, see [Configuring the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-config).\n\n\n\n Launcher appearance and behavior \n\nThe web chat launcher welcomes and engages customers so they know where to find help if they need it. By default, the web chat launcher appears in a small initial state as a circle in the bottom right corner:\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.031746031746031744, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03418-4-2127", "score": 0.03125, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

For example, you must keep up with browser support changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and design the layout and styling. The time you spend designing and maintaing a UI can be better spent building a quality assistant instead. When you use the web chat integration, you can rely on us to manage the user interface, so you can focus on designing conversational exchanges that address the unique business needs of your customers. Cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research is incorporated into the web chat to deliver an exceptional user experience.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy the web chat, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

If the device goes offline in the middle of a conversation, appropriate error messages and retries occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a JavaScript bridge \n\nIn some situations, your mobile application might need to communicate with the Watson Assistant web chat. For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16334-20193-22029", "score": 0.029850746268656716, "text": "\n* \"User is typing\" support: The web chat now supports displaying the \"user is typing\" message for service desks.

The responses from your assistant are defined by you in the underlying skill and can be written in any language you want.\n\nEven if your skill includes responses in a language other than English, some of the phrases that are displayed in the web chat widget are added by the web chat itself and do not come from the underlying skill. These hardcoded phrases are specified in English unless you choose to apply a different language.\n\nThere are language files that contain translations of each English-language phrase that is used by the web chat. You can instruct the web chat to use one of these other languages files by using the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nLikewise, the web chat applies an American English locale to content that is added by the web chat unless you specify something else. The locale setting affects how values such as dates and times are formatted.\n\nTo configure the web chat for customers outside the US, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-20684-22621", "score": 0.028985507246376812, "text": "\nLikewise, the web chat applies an American English locale to content that is added by the web chat unless you specify something else.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 to encrypt communication. RS256 cryptography is a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16280-4696-6712", "score": 0.02857142857142857, "text": "\nYou can configure how and where the web chat widget appears, and you can use theming to align it with your branding and website design.
