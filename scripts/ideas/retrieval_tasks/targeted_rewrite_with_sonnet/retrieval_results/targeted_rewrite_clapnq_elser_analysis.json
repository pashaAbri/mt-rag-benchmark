The offense controls an oval-shaped football and attempts to advance by running with or passing the ball, while the defense tries to stop them. Teams must advance at least ten yards in four downs to keep possession.\n\n**Scoring**: In American football, points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking through goalposts for a field goal.\n\n**Terminology**: In the United States, American football is simply called \"football,\" while soccer retains the name \"soccer.\" In other English-speaking countries where soccer is more popular, American football requires the qualifier \"American football\" or \"gridiron.\"\n\nThe documents indicate soccer involves kicking a ball to score goals, but don't provide detailed gameplay specifics for comparison.",

There's a Women's Football Tournament at the Olympic Games since 1996, and the sport is played professionally by women in numerous countries worldwide.\n\nHowever, the documents also reveal ongoing gender inequality issues in soccer, including struggles for equal pay and opportunities, less television coverage for women's games compared to men's, and past controversial comments from FIFA leadership about women's presentation in the sport.\n\n**American Football**: I do not have specific information about gender participation in American football from the provided documents. The passages about American football focus on gameplay rules and terminology but don't address whether both men and women play the sport or if there are any gender restrictions.\n\nSo while soccer clearly welcomes both genders (despite equality challenges), I cannot provide information about American football's gender participation based on these documents.",

He negotiated crucial agreements with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany between 1970-1972, including the Moscow Agreement, Warsaw Agreement, and agreements on West Berlin's status and West-East German relations.\n\nA defining moment was his \"Warschauer Kniefall\" on December 7, 1970, when he knelt before a monument to Warsaw Ghetto Uprising victims - an unprecedented gesture of humility and penance by a German Chancellor.\n\nThese diplomatic efforts significantly improved East-West relations and eventually contributed to dismantling Soviet control over East-Central Europe. For his contributions to world peace, Brandt won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.\n\nHis chancellorship ended in May 1974 when he was forced to resign after a senior staff member, Günter Guillaume, was exposed as an East German Stasi spy.",

More specifically, HIV-1 was initially transmitted from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to humans in the early 1900s in Southeast Cameroon, Africa, through exposure to infected blood and body fluids while butchering bushmeat.\n\n**Timeline**: It is estimated that HIV-1 entered the human population in Africa in the early 1900s, but symptomatic infections were not reported until the 1980s. The disease was first officially recognized on June 5, 1981.\n\n**Regional Spread**: In West Africa specifically, the onset of the HIV epidemic began in 1985 with reported cases in Benin and Nigeria, and in nearby countries such as Côte d'Ivoire in subsequent years. By the 1990s, AIDS became a significant problem for the West African region, particularly in Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Nigeria.\n\n**Global Spread**: HIV-1 was effectively absent from Europe until the late 1980s, showing how the virus gradually spread from its African origins to become a global pandemic.",

Research shows that when T-cells are modified to no longer express CCR5, they become resistant to HIV-1 infection and can eventually dominate over unmodified cells that HIV kills.\n\n- **Topical prevention**: The anti-HIV drug tenofovir, when used in a microbicidal vaginal gel, was reported to reduce herpes virus sexual transmission by 51% in 2011.\n\n**Ongoing Research**: The documents indicate that NIH has funded basic research on HIV/AIDS, and many treatment drugs have emerged from American pharmaceutical laboratories.\n\nWhile these represent significant advances, the research described focuses primarily on treatment strategies and prevention rather than indicating a widely available cure.",

Common cage types include those with solid or wire mesh floors, with \"Cubes and Coroplast\" (C&C) style cages being popular. Cages are typically lined with wood shavings or similar materials, with safer options being hardwood materials like aspen, paper products, or corn cob materials.\n\nRegarding their activity patterns, domestic guinea pigs have developed different biological rhythms from their wild counterparts. They have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Their activity is scattered randomly throughout the day, with no regular circadian patterns apparent aside from avoiding intense light. This contrasts with wild cavies who are most active during dawn and dusk.\n\nGuinea pigs tend to be messy in their cages, often jumping into food bowls, kicking bedding around, and marking territory by urinating and dragging their bodies across cage floors.",

They learn to recognize their owners and will whistle when their owner approaches. They also respond to sounds like plastic bags rustling or refrigerator doors opening where their food is stored.\n\n**Social Needs:** Interestingly, in Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and is forbidden by law, indicating they benefit from companionship.\n\nGuinea pigs continue to be a popular choice of pet today.",

When Japan occupied northern French Indochina, Roosevelt announced a $100 million loan to China. After Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina in July 1941, Roosevelt cut off oil sales to Japan, depriving it of over 95% of its oil supply. He also placed Philippine military under American command and reinstated General MacArthur.\n\n**Soviet Entry Against Japan:**\nAt the February 1945 Yalta Conference, Roosevelt's primary focus was convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan, as the Joint Chiefs estimated an American invasion could cause one million American casualties.\n\n**Territorial Arrangements:**\nIn exchange for Soviet entry into the war against Japan, Roosevelt agreed that the Soviet Union would receive control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. This arrangement was formalized at Yalta, where Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin also established frameworks for post-war institutions including the United Nations.",

This makes them ideal research models for studying vitamin C deficiency and scurvy.\n\n**Historical Research Contributions:**\n- In 1907, scientists accidentally discovered that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs\n- From this accidental discovery through 1932, guinea pigs were used to prove the chemical structure of the \"ascorbutic factor\" (vitamin C)\n- The guinea pig model proved crucial throughout vitamin C research development\n\n**Research Applications:**\nGuinea pigs are specifically used to research scurvy, the disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. Since they develop scurvy in the same way humans do when deprived of vitamin C, they serve as accurate models for understanding:\n- How vitamin C deficiency affects the body\n- The chemical structure and function of vitamin C\n- Treatment and prevention of scurvy\n\nThis biological parallel between guinea pigs and humans regarding vitamin C metabolism makes them uniquely valuable for this specific area of nutritional and medical research.",

The European Union limits compensation to at most $1500, which in some countries has restricted donors to \"the poorest segments of society.\"\n\nSo while there is financial compensation, the documents suggest egg donation may exploit financial vulnerability rather than represent a sustainable business opportunity.",

Andreas died in 1502.\n\nThe documents also mention that one passage references \"the capture of Constantinople by Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453,\" which marks the end of the Byzantine Empire, confirming that Constantine XI was indeed the final legitimate emperor.",

The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation, and food supplies foreshadowed the total warfare seen in later world wars.\n\nThe scale of destruction and human cost was unprecedented in American experience, leaving lasting scars on the nation that took generations to heal.",

This leads to a significant decrease in the production of blood cells and blood platelets.\n\n**Compromised Immune System**: When bone marrow function is impaired, it results in a depressed immune system, making the body vulnerable to infections and diseases.\n\n**Treatment-Related Damage**: Exposure to radiation or chemotherapy kills many of the rapidly dividing cells in bone marrow, further compromising blood cell production. Many symptoms of radiation poisoning are actually due to damage sustained by bone marrow cells.\n\n**Need for Transplantation**: Severe bone marrow diseases may require bone marrow transplants to restore normal function.

As the Moon continues orbiting, we gradually see more of the illuminated surface, progressing through crescent, first-quarter, gibbous, and full moon phases. Then the cycle reverses as the Moon \"wanes.\"\n\nThe geometric shapes we observe result from the intersection of an ellipse and circle when viewing an illuminated sphere from different angles.

Specifically, when discussing the hatred between the families in Romeo and Juliet and how this hatred manifests in the lovers' language (such as Juliet speaking of \"my only love sprung from my only hate\"), this \"leads on to speculation as to the playwright's psychology, in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare's grief for the death of his son, Hamnet.\"\n\nThe documents also note that while most scholars reject a direct connection between Hamnet and Shakespeare's play Hamlet, some critics like Stephen Greenblatt have argued that \"the coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy.\"\n\nSo Hamnet represents a potential biographical influence on Shakespeare's tragic works, including Romeo and Juliet.",

Shortly after this moment, Richmond kills Richard in their final duel.\n\nThe quote's significance extends beyond the play itself, as evidenced by its widespread cultural impact. The documents show how this line has been referenced and parodied in various forms of entertainment:\n\n- In the 1949 Looney Tunes cartoon \"A Ham in a Role\"\n- In Mel Brooks' 1993 film \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" \n- In Anton Chekhov's \"Three Sisters,\" where a character says \"Half my kingdom for a glass of tea!\" as a reference\n- In Richard Loncraine's 1995 film adaptation, where the line is spoken when Richard's jeep becomes trapped\n\nThe quote represents Richard's desperation in his final moments and has become one of Shakespeare's most recognizable lines, frequently quoted and adapted in popular culture.",

      "generated_response": "Based on the provided documents, the breaking of glass at Jewish weddings has several meanings, though its exact origin is unknown:\n\n**Primary reasons include:**\n\n1. **Tempering joy** - The main explanation is that joy must always be tempered. This comes from Talmudic accounts of rabbis who broke vessels (including glass) to calm down wedding celebrations that were getting out of hand.\n\n2. **Mourning the Temple's destruction** - It serves as a reminder that despite the joy, Jews still mourn the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Some couples recite verses from Psalm 137:5 (\"If I forget thee O Jerusalem...\") at this moment.\n\n**The ritual itself:** The groom traditionally breaks the glass by crushing it with his right foot after the bride receives the ring (timing varies by local custom). Guests then shout \"mazel tov\" (congratulations). Sometimes a lightbulb is substituted because it breaks more easily and makes a louder sound.\n\nHowever, some religious authorities, like former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, have criticized when the custom becomes too lighthearted, arguing it should express sorrow over Jerusalem's destruction rather than become an opportunity for celebration.",

      "generated_response": "Based on the documents, the Friends actors received equal pay because of the show's deliberate ensemble format and the cast's collective decision to negotiate together.\n\n**Ensemble Format Design:**\nSeries creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman strongly envisioned Friends as an ensemble comedy where all six characters were \"of equal importance.\" Crane preferred this approach because \"utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines.\"\n\n**Collective Negotiation Strategy:**\nThe cast made a groundbreaking decision to negotiate as a group rather than individually. Before season three salary negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals, the actors entered collective negotiations. They famously became \"the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries.\"\n\n**Equal Pay Implementation:**\nThe actors agreed that everyone would receive the salary of the least paid cast member, which meant some actors (like Aniston and Schwimmer) actually had their salaries reduced to match others. This collective approach helped them secure equal pay increases from $75,000 per episode in season three to eventually $1 million per episode in seasons nine and ten.",

Producer Kevin Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny and that the live audience was an integral part of the series.\n\n**Notable Exceptions:**\n- The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00 am\n- The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London due to the series' popularity in the UK, filmed in a studio with three audiences of 500 people each\n- The fifth-season finale was set in Las Vegas but was still filmed at Warner Bros. Studios\n\nThe show was filmed in front of live audiences, with each 22-minute episode taking six hours to film.",

He often styled his name as \"e e cummings,\" as he sometimes signed it.\n\n**Literary Output:**\nCummings wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. His first published work was \"The Enormous Room\" (an autobiographical novel), followed by his first poetry collection \"Tulips and Chimneys\" (1923), which introduced the public to his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\n**Personal Life:**\nIn 1926, his parents were in a car accident where only his mother survived, though she was severely injured. Cummings later described this accident in his \"i: six nonlectures\" series at Harvard (1952-1953).\n\n**Legacy:**\nHis papers are preserved at Harvard University's Houghton Library and the University of Texas at Austin's Harry Ransom Center.",

He graduated from Harvard University in 1915 with an advanced degree in 1916, where he developed interest in modern poetry that ignored conventional grammar and syntax.\n\n**Artistic Evolution:**\nHis father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, marking a new period in his artistic life. He began focusing on more important life aspects in his poetry and paid homage to his father in the poem \"my father moved through dooms of love.\"\n\n**Influences and Style Development:**\nHis visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and surrealism, which he reflected in his work. He was also influenced by modernists like Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, and imagist Amy Lowell. Over time, he shifted from using simile and metaphor to relying more on symbolism and allegory, making his later poetry \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound.\"\n\n**Reputation:**\nHis collections \"Tulips and Chimneys\" (1923) and \"XLI Poems\" (1925) established his reputation as an avant-garde poet.",

      "generated_response": "Based on the provided documents, air-to-air aviation photography appears to be more difficult than ground-to-air aviation photography.\n\nThe documents indicate several factors that make air-to-air photography more challenging:\n\n**Air-to-air complexity:**\n- Requires \"additional skills,\" especially for military aviation photography\n- Both photographer and target aircraft may fly \"at velocities of over Mach 1, while under moderate to high G\"\n- Must coordinate two aircraft in flight simultaneously\n- Requires precise timing and positioning for proper lighting relative to the sun\n- Limited to \"certain times of the day and/or by flying at a heading that lines the sun up on the subject aircraft properly\"\n\n**Ground-to-air simplicity:**\n- Described as \"the most popular form of aviation photography\" (along with ground-static)\n- Photographer remains stationary on the ground\n- Only requires \"a long focus photographic lens\" due to distance\n\nWhile ground-to-air photography has the challenge of greater distance requiring long lenses, air-to-air photography involves the complexity of coordinating multiple aircraft, high-speed flight conditions, G-forces, and more restrictive timing and positioning requirements.",

      "rewritten_query": "Are there any other types of aviation photography besides air-to-air photography (where photographers fly in one aircraft to photograph other aircraft in flight) and ground-to-air photography (where photographers on the ground photograph aircraft in flight)?",
      "generated_response": "Yes, based on the provided documents, there are two other types of aviation photography besides air-to-air and ground-to-air photography:\n\n**Ground-static photography:** Photos of stationary aircraft are taken by photographers on the ground. This can include aircraft exteriors, interiors, and aircraft details. The photographer has full control over lighting, aircraft placement, camera angles, and background. It's easier to involve other subjects like pilots or additional aircraft in ground-static photography compared to other forms. This is described as one of the most popular forms of aviation photography along with ground-to-air.\n\n**Remote photography:** This is a variation of air-to-air photography where the camera is mounted on the external aircraft structure away from the photographer and triggered remotely using mechanical or electrical shutter release. The image must be composed while the aircraft is on the ground since the photographer has no access to the camera during flight. This requires extensive planning and brainstorming to achieve the desired shot. Remote photography is described as \"the least common type of aviation photography.\"",
