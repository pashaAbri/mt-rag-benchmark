An exchange with a user is not considered a billable conversation until the user submits a message.\"\n- This means billing is conversation-based, where a billable conversation begins when a customer actually submits a message to the assistant.\n\n**What Counts as Billable**:\n- If an assistant initiates with \"Hi, how can I help you?\" but the user closes the browser without responding, this is included in conversation counts but is **not billable**\n- Billing only starts when the user actively engages by sending a message\n\n**Weak Understanding Impact**:\nThe documents don't indicate that weak understanding metrics affect billing calculations. Weak understanding messages (those not classified by intent and containing no known entities) appear to be counted the same as other messages for billing purposes.\n\n**Key Point**: The billing is based on user-initiated conversations rather than the number of individual message turns or the quality of understanding (weak vs. strong) of those messages.\n\nHowever, the documents don't provide complete details about all billing scenarios or whether there are different billing models available.",

Include more distinct, meaningful terms.\n\n2. **Use Query API for Control**: For more precise results, use the query API instead of natural language queries, which gives you access to specific operators like the phrase operator.\n\n3. **Understand Natural Language Behavior**: Remember that quoted phrases in natural language queries boost scores but don't limit results to exact matches only.\n\n4. **Customize Stop Words**: You can augment the stop words list for your collection to improve query-time processing.\n\nThese improvements focus on query structure, indexing strategy, and understanding system behavior.",

You can then create user subsets with different IAM access policies to differentiate access at the namespace level.\n\n**Important Note:** You cannot share namespaces across multiple accounts - users must be invited to the same account to access Container Registry resources.",

Log in to IBM Cloud and target your desired region:\n   ```\n   ibmcloud login -r us-south [--sso]\n   ```\n\n2. Create a namespace using the `ibmcloud cr namespace-add` command\n\n**Namespace Rules:**\n- Must be unique across all IBM Cloud accounts in the same region\n- 4-30 characters long\n- Start and end with letter or number\n- Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_)\n- Don't include personal information\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Namespaces are created in resource groups for access control\n- You can have up to 100 namespaces per region\n- Same namespace name can be used across different regions\n- Multiple namespaces allow separate environments (production/staging)\n- Setting your first namespace assigns you to the free service plan\n\n**Management:**\n- Use `ibmcloud cr namespace-list -v` to view existing namespaces and their resource group assignments\n- Older namespaces (pre-July 2020) can be assigned to resource groups using `ibmcloud cr namespace-assign`\n\nNo namespace is needed if you only use IBM-provided public images.",

      "generated_response": "Based on the provided documents, there are several installation methods available for the IBM Cloud Functions mobile SDK, each with different considerations:\n\n**Current Options:**\n- **CocoaPods**: Most common method, but may show Swift version warnings that need configuration\n- **Carthage**: Alternative package manager (mentioned but details not provided)\n- **Source code**: Direct installation from GitHub, requires manual Xcode building\n- **CLI starter app**: Uses `ibmcloud fn sdk install iOS` command followed by `pod install`\n\n**Important Limitation:** The mobile SDK is **not supported for IAM-based namespaces** - you must use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n**Recommendation:** The choice depends on your project setup and preferences. CocoaPods remains the standard approach despite potential Swift version warnings, which can be resolved through Xcode's conversion tool or build settings. If you're experiencing specific issues with your current method, Carthage or source installation might be alternatives, but the fundamental IAM limitation would still apply.\n\nWhat specific limitations are you encountering with your current installation method?",

It's a two-way function that hides the original value but allows conversion back to the original state using keys. The documents show that \"all backups are encrypted\" in various IBM services.\n\n**Data Backup and Disaster Recovery** are operational processes focused on data availability and business continuity. The documents describe backup as creating copies of data (performed daily in most cases), while disaster recovery involves restoring services and data after catastrophic events.\n\n**How they work together:** The documents show that encryption is applied *to* backups for security. For example, in Maximo Application Suite, \"all backups are encrypted\" and stored in separate data centers. Similarly, IBM Cloud Databases provide \"automatic daily backups\" that include encryption.\n\nIn essence, encryption protects data from unauthorized access (confidentiality), while backup and disaster recovery ensure data can be recovered when lost or systems fail (availability). Both are essential components of a comprehensive data protection strategy, but they serve different purposes.",

It's divided into subnets using private IP addresses.\n\n- **Regional deployment**: Each VPC is deployed to a single region but can span multiple zones within that region for improved fault tolerance.\n\n- **Private connectivity**: All resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network by default, regardless of their subnet.\n\n- **External connectivity options**: Instances can connect to the public internet through public gateways or floating IP addresses.\n\n- **High performance**: Supports quick provisioning of virtual server instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.\n\nThe documents describe VPC as giving enterprises \"the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\" It's compared to having your own private condominium versus sharing an apartment - providing exclusive control over your cloud environment.",

A dialog skill contains multiple dialog nodes that work together to create the complete conversational experience. You can check how many dialog nodes are in your dialog skill through the assistant interface or API.\n\n**Analogy:**\nThink of a dialog skill as a book, and dialog nodes as the individual chapters - the skill is the overall container, while nodes are the specific building blocks that make up the conversation logic.",

IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store\n2. Its internal implementation is not efficient for handling large amounts of binary data\n3. This results in slow performance and high costs\n4. Attachments can impact overall database performance\n\n**Better approach:**\nInstead, IBM recommends storing binary data in a separate solution better suited for this purpose (like IBM Cloud Object Storage) and storing only the attachment metadata, token, or URL in the IBM Cloudant document.

This approach:\n- Avoids size limit issues\n- Improves performance\n- Reduces costs\n- Makes replication more reliable\n\nSo while you *can* store images or PDFs as attachments up to 10 MB, it's better practice to use dedicated object storage for binary files and reference them via URLs in your Cloudant documents.",
