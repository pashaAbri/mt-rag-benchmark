Galileo made significant discoveries including evidence for a saltwater ocean beneath Europa's icy surface and extensive volcanic processes on Io. The mission ended in September 2003 when it was intentionally plunged into Jupiter's atmosphere.\n\n2. **Juno** - NASA's current Jupiter orbiter that continues exploring the planet, its ring system, and moons. Juno builds on the discoveries of previous missions and is scheduled to continue its mission through September 2025, when its orbit will naturally degrade and it will be consumed in Jupiter's atmosphere.",

      "rewritten_query": "How are cyclones on Earth formed?",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided documents, cyclones (hurricanes) on Earth form through the following process:\n\n**Initial Formation:**\nTropical cyclones form only over warm ocean waters near the equator, using warm, moist air as fuel. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from the surface, creating an area of lower air pressure below.\n\n**Development Process:**\nAir from surrounding higher pressure areas rushes into the low pressure zone. This \"new\" air also becomes warm and moist and rises. As the warm air continues rising and cooling, the water vapor forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, continuously fed by the ocean's heat and evaporating water.\n\n**Rotation and Eye Formation:**\nDue to Earth's rotation, storms north of the equator spin counterclockwise while those south spin clockwise. As the system rotates faster, an eye forms in the center - very calm and clear with low air pressure, where higher pressure air flows down from above.\n\n**Classification:**\nWhen winds reach 39 mph, it becomes a \"tropical storm.\" At 74 mph winds, it officially becomes a \"tropical cyclone\" or hurricane, with categories 1-5 based on wind speed (74 mph to 157+ mph).\n\n**Weakening:**\nTropical cyclones typically weaken upon hitting land since they lose their energy source from warm ocean waters.",

Food scraps make up approximately 35% of waste in Alameda County.\n\n**What happens to food scraps:**\nInstead of going to landfills, your food scraps are sent to composting facilities where they become compost used by landscapers and farmers, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Important note:**\nFood scraps put down garbage disposals do NOT get composted - they end up in the wastewater system.\n\nFood scrap recycling is included in your unlimited organics collection service at no additional cost.

For example, if your regular day is Tuesday, you'll get service on Wednesday; if it's Friday, you'll get service on Saturday.\n\n**Proper Cart Placement:**\n- **Curbside customers:** Place carts within 3 feet of curb no earlier than 6:00 p.m. the day before collection, preferably before 7:00 a.m. to reduce scavenging\n- **On-premises customers:** Keep carts in accessible side/rear yard locations out of street view\n- Remove carts by midnight on collection day\n\n**If You Miss Collection:**\nCall Republic Services at (800) 320-8077 before 12 noon for same-day return service.\n\n**Service Hours:**\nMonday-Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\n\n**Key tip:** Other holidays don't affect collection schedules - only the five major holidays listed above cause delays.",

The vaccine stimulates your immune system to respond to the virus\n2. Your body makes antibodies in response\n3. If exposed to COVID-19 later, these antibodies help your immune system recognize and fight the virus quickly\n\n**Important facts:**\n- Vaccines use the same natural immune process your body already uses against germs\n- They're a safer way to learn to make antibodies against dangerous viruses\n- None of the current vaccines can give you COVID-19\n- They use inactivated virus, harmless pieces of virus, or genes from the virus\n\nThis process helps protect you from getting COVID-19 and reduces severity if you do get infected.",

Europa is a high priority for exploration because it holds a salty liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust.\n\nThe spacecraft will conduct 40-45 flybys of Europa, rapidly passing by the moon as frequently as every two weeks to gather scientific data while minimizing exposure to Jupiter's challenging radiation environment. This detailed exploration will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for habitable worlds beyond Earth.",

Communities have spent millions of dollars to remove contaminants from water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. While cleanup is effective, it significantly affects the cost of providing water to customers.\n\n**Proper Disposal:**\nThe documents reference proper disposal of Household Hazardous Wastes, though specific disposal locations aren't detailed in these passages.\n\nThe key message is that prevention through proper handling and disposal of household toxic products is the most effective and economical solution.",

It takes 2 hours to heat up and runs for about 1 hour per session.\n\n**Operational constraints:** MOXIE runs infrequently (once every 1-2 months) because it consumes most of the rover's power, preventing other operations during use.\n\n**Future goal:** The current MOXIE is a scale model for a future \"Big MOXIE\" that would need to produce 2,000-3,000 grams per hour to support human missions.",

The soft drink Moxie was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works.\n\nThere are several interesting connections between the Mars instrument and the beverage:\n\n1. The Moxie company was reportedly the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy, while on Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make anything at all.\n\n2. There's even a technical connection - when MOXIE runs, operators must be careful with settings to avoid producing pure carbon instead of carbon monoxide, as this would damage the instrument. This destructive process is called \"coking,\" and the carbon deposit is called \"coke\" - another beverage reference.\n\nThe beverage Moxie can still be purchased in New England and is considered the official drink of Maine.",

By studying both Vesta and Ceres, Dawn helped scientists better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system.\n\nDawn exemplifies the Discovery Program's goals of conducting focused, scientifically valuable missions that answer critical questions in solar system science while maintaining cost-effectiveness and shorter development timelines compared to larger flagship missions.",

      "generated_response": "Based on the provided documents, an Earth satellite orbit is the path a satellite follows as it travels around Earth. The satellite's orbital characteristics are determined by three key factors: height (distance from Earth's surface), eccentricity (how circular or elliptical the orbit is), and inclination (the angle between the orbit's plane and Earth's equator).\n\nThere are three main classes of Earth orbits based on altitude:\n\n**Low Earth Orbit**: Starts just above the atmosphere, where most scientific satellites operate\n**Medium Earth Orbit**: Includes GPS satellites and specialty monitoring satellites\n**High Earth Orbit**: Farthest from Earth's surface, used by weather and communication satellites\n\nThe height of an orbit determines the satellite's speed - closer satellites move faster due to stronger gravitational pull. For example, NASA's Aqua satellite at 705 kilometers takes about 99 minutes to orbit Earth, while weather satellites at 36,000 kilometers take nearly 24 hours.\n\nSpecial orbits include geostationary orbits, where satellites remain above the same Earth location, making them ideal for weather monitoring and communications.",

As one document explains, \"it would take almost 1,000 Jupiters to fill it up!\" This massive size creates the gravitational pressure necessary to fuse hydrogen atoms into helium, which is what makes the Sun shine and provides energy to our solar system.",
