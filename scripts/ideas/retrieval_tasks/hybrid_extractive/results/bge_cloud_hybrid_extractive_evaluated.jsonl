These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00553-4119-5416","score":0.7009577751,"text":"\n* [Getting a list of all databases in the account](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-get-a-list-of-all-databases-in-the-account)\n* [Getting documents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-get-documents)\n* [Sending multiple queries to a database](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-send-multiple-queries-to-a-database)\n* [Getting changes to documents in the database](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-get-changes)\n* [Deleting a database](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-deleting-a-database)\n* [How is data stored in IBM Cloudant?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-is-data-stored-in-ibm-cloudant-)\n* [Document versioning and MVCC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-document-versioning-and-mvcc)\n* [Database partitioning](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n* [Conflicts](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-conflicts)\n* [CAP Theorem](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theorem)\n* [Combining IBM Cloudant with other IBM services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-combine-ibm-services)\n\n\n\n* How documents work\n\n\n\n* [Overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-documents)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-http-works-with-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07103-24686-26733","score":0.6953055859,"text":"\nGo there to see a list of the documents in your collection and get a quick view of information about the documents.

A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST \/$DATABASE\/_index HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Type: application\/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04334-99234-100388","score":0.7044089437,"text":"\nA file contains input JSON data.-i, --instance: Instance name or ID.

These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15253-6662-8253","score":0.6734073162,"text":"\nRun one of the following commands based on the image you plan to use.\n\n\n\n* Select a stock image or a custom image from your account for your instance.\n\nTo list all available images, run the following command:\n\nibmcloud is images\n\nDeprecated images do not include the most current support.\n\nLet's pick image ibm-debian-11-3-minimal-amd64-1.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-3166-5282","score":0.6679807305,"text":"\nIt is accessed with an HTTP API and can therefore be accessed by any device on the internet that speaks HTTP: application code, web browser, IoT device, or mobile phone.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15243-21116-22774","score":0.6631757617,"text":"\nr134-f83ce520-00b5-40c5-9938-a5c82a273f91 ibm-debian-11-3-minimal-amd64-4 available amd64 debian-11-amd64 11.x Bullseye\/Stable 1\n\nFor a full list of command options, see [ibmcloud is images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-referenceimages-list).\n\nDeprecated images do not include the most current support.\n* To list all available images shared from a private catalog, run the following commands:\n\nIf you select a catalog image that belongs to a different account, you have extra considerations and limitations to review.

The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Pricing is based on the aggregate number of minutes of audio that you recognize per month:\n\n\n\n* Users who recognize 1 to 999,999 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.02 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n* Users who recognize at least 1,000,000 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.01 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n\n\n\nThe Plus plan is intended for small businesses. It is also a good choice for large enterprises that want to develop and test larger applications before considering moving to a Premium plan. For more information, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog\/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I continue to use the Speech to Text Standard plan? \n\nThe Standard plan is no longer available for purchase by new users.

Their API settings and custom models remain unaffected.\n\nExisting users can also choose to upgrade to the new Plus plan by visiting the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog\/speech-to-text).

And, if they find that the Plus plan does not meet their needs for any reason, they can always downgrade back to their Standard plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n What pricing plan do I need to use the service's customization interface? \n\nYou must have a paid plan (Plus, Standard, or Premium) to use language model or acoustic model customization.

You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16280-4696-6712","score":0.6539588571,"text":"\nYou can configure how and where the web chat widget appears, and you can use theming to align it with your branding and website design.

You can edit these settings by selecting the channel in an environment, or in Integrations.\n\nIf you make an update to a channel in the draft environment, the same channel in live environment is not affected in the live environment. Similarly, if you make an update to a channel in the live environment, the same channel in draft environment is not affected.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16387-7-1890","score":0.6843611598,"text":"\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public\/private key pair.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":0.6447834969,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16295-7-1721","score":0.6927166581,"text":"\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

When you add an example to a training-data query, you include a relevance label that indicates the relevance (or \"goodness\" versus \"badness\") of the document as it applies to the specified query.\n\nExamples are identified by the indexed document ID. As noted, every example must include a label that indicates the \"goodness\" or \"badness\" of the document as it pertains to the query.\n\nExamples can optionally specify a cross-reference query. The cross-reference query needs to return only the example document and must be independent of the unique Watson Discovery document ID. Cross-reference queries are not currently used automatically but can be used to repair training data in the event that new IDs are assigned to documents during an ingestion event.\n\n\n\n\n\n Training data requirements","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-api"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07108-7-1958","score":0.6663370132,"text":"\nExpanding the meaning of queries \n\nYou can improve the quality of search results by expanding the meaning of the queries that are submitted by customers.\n\nTo expand the scope of a query beyond exact matches, add a synonyms list to your collection. When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search. For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms. For example, a query for ibm expands to ibm OR international business machines OR big blue.\n\nBidirectional example:\n\n{\n\"expansions\": [\n{\n\"expanded_terms\":\n\"ibm\",\n\"international business machines\",\n\"big blue\"\n]\n}\n]\n}\n\nUnidirectional\n: The input_terms in the query is replaced by the expanded_terms. For example, a query for banana is converted to plantain OR fruit and does not contain the original term, banana. If you want an input term to be included in the query, then repeat the input term in the expanded terms list.\n\nUnidirectional example:\n\n{\n\"expansions\": [\n{\n\"input_terms\":\n\"banana\"\n],\n\"expanded_terms\":","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-search-settings"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07115-8595-10654","score":0.6652619243,"text":"\nCheck your progress to see when enough rating information is available to meet the training threshold needs.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00576-7-1946","score":0.8094475865,"text":"\nUsing IBM Cloudant \n\nIf you never use IBM Cloudant or NoSQL databases in general, scan this introduction and some best practices before you read further.

With IBM Cloudant, this definition can include static items, database documents, and configuration and statistical information. In most cases, the information is returned in the form of a JSON document.\n\nHEAD\n: The HEAD method retrieves the HTTP header of a GET request without the body of the response.\n\nPOST\n: Upload data.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

In early stages of your annotation project, you might find that relation scores are often worse than mention scores because a perfect relation annotation requires that the mentions that define the relationship be in agreement first.\n\nThe score in the All column is a Fleiss Kappa score. It represents how consistently the same annotation was applied by multiple human annotators across all overlapping documents in the task. The value, which can range up to 1 and even be negative, can help you identify weaknesses in the annotation guidelines or particular human annotators. The following guidelines (Landis and Koch, 1977) provide a starting point for assessing overall performance.\n\nTable 1. Inter-annotator guidelines\n\n\n\n Score Agreement level \n\n < 0 Poor \n .01 -.20 Slight \n .21 -.40 Fair \n .41 - .60 Moderate \n .61 - .80 Substantial \n .81 - 1.0 Perfect \n\n\n\nThe score in the other columns is an F1 measure. It represents the level of annotation consistency between a pair of human annotators. The value can range from 0 to 1, where perfect agreement is indicated by the score 1. What constitutes an acceptable level of agreement depends on your domain data and type system.

This choice is best for fields with unique or specialized terminology because this pre-annotator does not analyze the context in which the term is used in the way a machine learning pre-annotator does; it instead relies on the term being distinct enough to have a decipherable meaning regardless of the context in which it is used. For example, it is easier to recognize asbestos as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of squash, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.\n\nDictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes. Human annotators can specify entity subtypes for each pre-annotated mention by working on an [annotation task](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask) with the pre-annotated document.\n* Machine learning\n\nUses a machine learning model to automatically annotate documents. This option is only available to you if you have created a machine learning model with Knowledge Studio already.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-preannotation"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16507-10816-12778","score":0.716706872,"text":"\n[Natural Language Understanding](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/watson\/services\/natural-language-understanding\/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pre-annotating documents with a dictionary \n\nTo help human annotators get started with their annotation tasks, you can create a dictionary and use it to pre-annotate documents that you add to the corpus.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nWhen a human annotator begins work on documents that were pre-annotated, it is likely that a number of mentions will already be marked by entity types based on the dictionary entries.

Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin.

After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame. After 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged.

It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https:\/\/www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path. It can also simplify the number of purge calls made.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only) \n\nPurging by hostname is similar to purging by prefixes. Use a list of hostnames to purge the cache of any assets associated with those hostnames.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by tags (Enterprise only)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment-for-best-performance"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08217-3469-5347","score":0.6735634208,"text":"\nHow to fix it \n\nVirtual servers in paid plans aren't deleted.

This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often.

Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days.

The DEK is used for default encryption in all cases regardless of whether the customer wants to manage the encryption keys or not. The ICOS DEK is not managed by clients nor do they need to rotate it. For cases where clients do want to manage the encryption, they indirectly control the DEK by wrapping the DEK with their own \"root key\" stored in their Key Protect instance. A root key can be generated or imported, and managed by you in your Key Protect instance (for example, by rotating keys).\n\nKey Protect can generate DEKs (which wraps keys without passing plaintext) through its HSM.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is envelope encryption? \n\nEnvelope encryption is the practice of encrypting data with a data encryption key, and then encrypting the data encryption key with a highly secure key-wrapping key.

To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Cloud\/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation. Any updates that are needed post-deployment regarding Red Hat OpenShift configuration or setup should be performed by using Red Hat OpenShift tools and commands. If you use the Schematics interface to make changes to configuration properties and reapply those changes, you can cause disruptions to the running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Restoring it back to a working state might not be easy.\n\n\n\n  Architecture diagram \n\nZoom\n\n![Architecture diagram](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9de14ae11cc0bda57c240e5b42f2964edeaab3c6\/hpc-openshift\/images\/hpccluster_openshift_architecture.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

See [Transition to Enterprise](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-transitioning-next-plan).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I delete my CIS instance? \n\nTo delete a CIS instance, you must first delete all global load balancers, pools, and health checks. Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there. Activating the domain before migrating from CIS can cause your domain to changed to a [Moved state](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status).\n\n\n\n\n\n I added a user to my account and gave that user permission to manage Internet Services instance(s). Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04334-151724-152727","score":0.7120047212,"text":"\n<-- <\/section \"id=\"section-command-example-origin-certificate\" \"> --><-- <\/section \"id=\"section-origin-certificate\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-origin-certificate-delete\" \"> --> ibmcloud cis origin-certificate-delete Delete an origin certificate. ibmcloud cis origin-certificate-delete DNS_DOMAIN_ID CERT_ID --instance INSTANCE_NAME] ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\n<-- <section \"id=\"section-command-options-origin-certificate-delete\" \"> --> Command options DNS_DOMAIN_ID: The ID of DNS domain.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server.

It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks or challenges visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a nonstandard user agent. This tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again. This challenge is based on the visitor's IP, and therefore does not apply to challenges presented by WAF rules because they are based on an action that the user performs on your site.\n* Security level - Sets the security level of your website to determine which visitors receive a challenge page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04109-7-2036","score":0.7402511239,"text":"\nAssigning firewall rule actions \n\nFirewall rule actions tell CIS how to respond to requests that match the criteria you define.\n\nFor lightweight firewall rules, navigate to Security > IP firewall, which contains IP rules, User Agent rules, and Domain Lockdown rules.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install.

It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi.

Different operating systems and code page conversion programs handle letter shaping in different ways. Unshaped storage is a standard for Windows systems, and Knowledge Studio presumes that Arabic text is stored unshaped. If you want to upload shaped text into Knowledge Studio, you must first convert the text to unshaped form by using standard tools, such as the International Components for Unicode (ICU) API (see the ArabicShaping Class at [http:\/\/icu-project.org\/apiref\/icu4j\/com\/ibm\/icu\/text\/ArabicShaping.html ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](http:\/\/icu-project.org\/apiref\/icu4j\/com\/ibm\/icu\/text\/ArabicShaping.html)).\n\n> Important: In some cases, lack of proper Arabic character shaping might cause content to be displayed incorrectly in the ground truth editor.\n\nWith respect to numeric shaping, Knowledge Studio treats numeric shaping as a storage-level property, similar to how Arabic content is handled on the iOS platform. Because a lot of Arabic content is created on platforms like Windows, which treat numeric shaping as a display-level property, you need to either convert content to make numeric shaping a storage-level property or use a Firefox browser when you use Knowledge Studio. Firefox supports the ability to set numeric shaping preferences explicitly at the browser level and enforce the appropriate display for all content shown in the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo configure numeric shaping in the Firefox browser:\n\n\n\n1. In the browser URL field, enter about:config.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01022-0-1082","score":0.7144531608,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Data security and encryption \n\nThe IBM\u00ae Db2\u00ae on Cloud service has security built into all levels of its architecture.\n\nThe following methods are used to secure your data:\n\n\n\n*  The default keys are managed by [Key Protect](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-importing-keys).

You want to protect your data to help ensure it's secure, available, and maintains integrity. IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae provides several ways to protect your data and help keep your applications operational.\n\nSome of these protection features are automatic. For other forms of protection, IBM Cloudant provides you with supported tools that help you to create your own high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.\n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Service has Business Continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of the Cloud Service within hours if a disaster occurs. You are responsible for your data backup, and associated recovery of your content.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the automatic capabilities and supported tools that are offered by IBM Cloudant.\n\n\n\n Types and levels of protection \n\nThe type of protection you might want depends on the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nFor example, you might want to have a high level of data availability so that you can still access your data, even if a limited amount of hardware within the system failed. This requirement is necessary for \"High Availability\" (HA). It means that you provide the best possible continuous data availability after a hardware failure. Different HA techniques tolerate different levels of failure before operations are affected.\n\nYou might want to have quick and easy ways of backing up and restoring data. For example, after a severe or extensive hardware failure, you want the ability to make all the data available on an alternative system as quickly as possible. This requirement is necessary for \"Disaster Recovery\" (DR). A disaster generally means that a database is no longer available in one or more locations. For example, a power outage might cause all systems in a database cluster to fail. Or a large-scale network failure might mean systems in a cluster can't be contacted, even though they continue to work correctly.\n\nAddressing your HA or DR requirements often begins by simplifying the problem into more generic requirements. When you identify your requirements, you can apply the tools and features that help solve the generic needs. Together, the tools and features can address your HA or DR requirements.\n\nDifferent tools and features provide different levels of protection. The different features might be more or less suitable for your specific HA or DR requirement.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14533-1761-4064","score":0.7485920787,"text":"\nThe encryption key is not stored and is unavailable to IBM.

The service comes with no additional cost.\n\nIBM-managed encryption uses the following industry standard protocols:\n\n\n\n* AES-256 encryption.\n* Keys are managed in-house with Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).\n* The self-encrypting drives in the Storage architecture are validated for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 Level 2.\n* Storage architecture is validated for Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n* Storage architecture is also validated for Payment Card Industry (PCI), Basel II, California Security Breach Information Act (SB 1386), and EU Data Protection Directive 95\/46\/EC compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Customer-managed encryption \n\nFor end-to-end encryption in the IBM Cloud, you can use customer-managed encryption. Your data is protected while at rest, and also in transit from the storage to the hypervisor and host. You are responsible for encrypting your data outside the VPC.\n\nWith customer-managed encryption, you can bring your own customer root key (CRK) to the cloud or have a [key management service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutkms-for-byok) (KMS) generate a key for you. Root keys are used to encrypt volume, file share, and custom image passphrases with [envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-envelope-encryption-byok), a process that wraps a key with another key.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16065-3261-5275","score":0.7827330828,"text":"\nFor example, this store contains information about each VPC Image resource, such as its name, CRN, and creation date. However, it does not contain the image data itself, which is hosted on the storage devices. All communication between control plane services and the control plane data store is secure and encrypted. \n Block Storage Each zone of each region contains a set of replicated storage devices, which host the data for your VPC volumes. Your data is always encrypted at rest, and is isolated to your account. In addition, you can use [Customer-managed encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about) and your own root keys for end-to-end encryption of your boot and data volumes. Regional buckets use Key Protect for data encrytion at rest. Storage data flows between storage devices and hypervisor nodes only, and does not flow to control nodes. \n Snapshots Snapshots that you create of your volumes are stored in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage and available for regional restoration. Your snapshots are protected using Key Protect for data encrytion at rest. Snapshot data flows between Object Storage and hypervisor nodes only, and does not flow to control nodes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n VPC dependencies \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) depends upon various IBM Cloud integrated services for purposes such as:\n\n\n\n* Hosting the internal microservices of the VPC service\n* Integrating with IBM Cloud and its user interface\n* Storing and backing up service data (including VPC resource metadata)\n* Logging and auditing service events.\n\n\n\nThe following table lists the main dependencies of the VPC service and the purpose of each one:\n\n\n\nTable 2. VPC dependencies\n\n Service Purpose \n\n IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management Provides authentication and authorization for all VPC requests.

Data encryption with your own root keys is available by using a supported key management service (KMS).\n\nVPN for VPC does not store any customer data other than what is required to configure VPN gateways, connections, and policies. Data that is transmitted through a VPN gateway is not encrypted by IBM. Data about your specific VPN and policy configurations are encrypted in transit and at rest. VPN configuration data is deleted upon your request through API or User Interface.\n\n\n\n How your data is stored and encrypted in VPC \n\nAll block storage volumes are encrypted by default with IBM-managed encryption. IBM\u00ae-managed keys are generated and securely stored in a block storage vault that is backed by Consul and maintained by IBM Cloud\u00ae operations.\n\nFor more security and control, you can protect your data with your own root keys (also called a customer root key or CRK). This feature is commonly called Bring Your Own Key, or BYOK. Root keys encrypt the keys that safeguard your data. You can import your root keys to Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Services, or have either key management service create one for you.\n\nThe KMS stores your key and makes it available during volume and custom image encryption. Key Protect provides FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance. Hyper Protect Crypto Services offers the highest level of security with FIPS 140-2 Level 4 compliance. Your key material is protected in transit (when it's transported) and at rest (when it is stored).\n\nCustomer-managed encryption is available for custom images, boot volumes, and data volumes. When an instance is provisioned from an encrypted custom image, its boot volume is encrypted by using the image\u2019s root key. You can also choose a different root key. Data volumes are encrypted by using root keys when you provision a virtual server instance or when you create a stand-alone volume.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-mng-data"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15710-3097-5054","score":0.7726583481,"text":"\nFor more information about envelope encryption, see [Protecting your sensitive data in VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-mng-datadata-encryption).\n\nAll your interaction with VPN for VPC is encrypted. For example, when you use an API or interact with the service through the User Interface to configure VPN gateways and VPN connections, all such interactions are encrypted end-to-end. Likewise, data elements that are related to your configuration are encrypted in transit and at rest. No personal or sensitive data is stored, processed, or transmitted. Data at rest is stored in an encrypted database.\n\nAfter the VPN for VPC is provisioned and the network connections are created, the encryption of data that you choose to transmit across the network is your responsibility.\n\n\n\n Instance storage data isolation and encryption \n\nThe instance storage disk or disks, which are attached to the virtual server instance, cannot be shared with any other virtual servers and cannot be accessed by any other virtual servers in the future. They are one-time use, single-attach, for the virtual server that requested the instance storage.\n\nInstance storage data is secured with on-disk encryption. The physical disks that are used for instance storage are self-encrypting with the strong AES-256 encryption standard. The data is automatically decrypted when your instance accesses the data. When your instance is shut down or deleted, the underlying storage space is erased and unrecoverable. At that point, the data is unrecoverable. For more information, see [Introduction to encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-basics).\n\nData is automatically encrypted on the physical media at the drive level. However, customer-managed keys are not supported for instance storage. For sensitive data, it is strongly recommended that users utilize software-based file system encryption such as LUKS for Linux\u00ae or BitLocker for Windows\u00ae.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-mng-data"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16035-23636-24324","score":0.769110024,"text":"\n* [Review the checklist](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-planningplanning-for-data-encryption) for planning data encryption and complete the [prerequisites](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-planningbyok-encryption-prereqs).\n* [Create virtual server instances with customer-managed encryption volumes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-instances-byok).\n* [Create a Block Storage for VPC volume with customer-managed encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-encryption).\n* [Create file shares with customer-managed encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-encryption).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15129-4208-5474","score":0.7625494003,"text":"\nKey Protect <br><br> * [Snapshot](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-planning)<br> * [Block storage volume](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage&interface=ui)<br> * [File Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-planning)<br> * [Image service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images)<br><br><br> Cloud Block Storage (server-protect) \n Hyper Protect Crypto service <br><br> * [Snapshot](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-planning)<br> * [Block storage volume](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage&interface=ui)<br> * [File Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-planning)<br> * [Image service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images)<br><br><br> Cloud Block Storage (server-protect) \n Virtual Server Instances <br><br> * [Auto scale](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group)<br><br><br> VPC Infrastructure Services (is) \n Various VPC Infrastructure Services -

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload.

In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and IBM Cloud service on the private backbone.

For example, when you use an API or interact with the service through the User Interface to configure VPN gateways and VPN connections, all such interactions are encrypted end-to-end. Likewise, data elements that are related to your configuration are encrypted in transit and at rest. No personal or sensitive data is stored, processed, or transmitted. Data at rest is stored in an encrypted database.\n\nAfter the VPN for VPC is provisioned and the network connections are created, the encryption of data that you choose to transmit across the network is your responsibility.\n\n\n\n Instance storage data isolation and encryption \n\nThe instance storage disk or disks, which are attached to the virtual server instance, cannot be shared with any other virtual servers and cannot be accessed by any other virtual servers in the future. They are one-time use, single-attach, for the virtual server that requested the instance storage.\n\nInstance storage data is secured with on-disk encryption. The physical disks that are used for instance storage are self-encrypting with the strong AES-256 encryption standard. The data is automatically decrypted when your instance accesses the data. When your instance is shut down or deleted, the underlying storage space is erased and unrecoverable. At that point, the data is unrecoverable. For more information, see [Introduction to encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-basics).\n\nData is automatically encrypted on the physical media at the drive level. However, customer-managed keys are not supported for instance storage.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14952-23087-24921","score":0.7233151197,"text":"\nTo prevent multiple clients from unknowingly overwriting each other's updates, select API methods support entity-tags and conditional requests.\n\nThis feature is now generally available.

If you change the digression settings of the folder, for example, the changes are inherited by all the nodes in the folder.\n* Tree hierarchy: Nodes in a folder are treated as root or child nodes based on whether the folder is added to the dialog tree at the root or child level.

The response might be the answer to a question such as Where can I get some gas? or the execution of a command, such as turning on the radio. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree.

The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16278-1850-3373","score":0.6852915883,"text":"\nHow actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

See [Disambiguation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02882-5559-7278","score":0.7055113912,"text":"\n[More icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/kabob.png) icon.\n\n\n\n* To create a peer node that is checked next if the condition for the existing node is not met, select Add node below.\n* To create a peer node that is checked before the condition for the existing node is checked, select Add node above.\n* To create a child node to the selected node, select Add child node.

The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\nTo learn more about creating intents, watch the following 2 1\/2-minute video.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03071-7-2056","score":0.6987182498,"text":"\nTutorial: Adding a node with slots to a dialog \n\nIn this tutorial, you will add slots to a dialog node to collect multiple pieces of information from a user within a single node.

A dialog feature takes precedence over actions. You can use actions to supplement a dialog-based conversation, but the dialog drives the conversation with users to match their requests.\n\nA dialog node calls an action to perform a task and then return to the dialog. From a single dialog node, you can make a call to either a webhook or an action, not both. Choose the approach that best suits your needs:\n\n\n\n* Call an action if you want to perform a discrete and self-contained task, and then return to the dialog to be ready to address any new user requests. Data collected from the user during action processing must be stored as a session variable for it to be passed to the dialog.\n* Call a webhook if you want to send a request to a web service to complete a task and return a response that can be used later by this dialog.

You can define a single action to check customer satisfaction and call it from multiple branch-ending dialog nodes.\n\nIn this scenario, you don't need to define an intent, such as check_satisfaction. The action is called automatically, replacing a jump to another dialog node's response.\n* You want to see how actions works.\n\nIn this scenario, you can pick an intent for the action to handle. If you plan for the action to be called from the dialog only, you can spend your time defining the user examples for the intent that triggers the dialog node.

Add your skill to an assistant, and then set up one or more integrations with which to deploy your skill. The assistant adds a layer of function to your skill that enables Watson Assistant to orchestrate and manage the flow of information for you. See [Assistants](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants).\n* Built-in integrations: Instead of going to the Deploy tab to deploy your workspace, you add your dialog skill to an assistant, and add integrations to the assistant through which the skill is made available to your users. You do not need to build a custom front-end application and manage the conversation state from one call to the next. However, you can still do so if you want to. See [Adding integrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add) for more information.\n* New major API version: A V2 version of the API is available. This version provides access to methods you can use to interact with an assistant at run time. No more passing context with each API call; the session state is managed for you as part of the assistant layer.\n\n\n\nWhat is presented in the tooling as a dialog skill is effectively a wrapper for a V1 workspace.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02953-7708-9981","score":0.687253952,"text":"\nFor example, you might group nodes that address questions about user accounts in a User account folder and nodes that handle payment-related queries in a Payment folder.\n* To group together a set of nodes that you want the dialog to process only if a certain condition is met. Use a condition, such as $isPlatinumMember, for example, to group together nodes that offer extra services that should only be processed if the current user is entitled to receive the extra services.\n* To hide nodes from the runtime while you work on them. You can add the nodes to a folder with a false condition to prevent them from being processed.\n\n\n\nThese characteristics of the folder impact how the nodes in a folder are processed:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If no condition is specified, then your assistant processes the nodes within the folder directly. If a condition is specified, your assistant first evaluates the folder condition to determine whether to process the nodes within it.\n* Customizations: Any configuration settings that you apply to the folder are inherited by the nodes in the folder. If you change the digression settings of the folder, for example, the changes are inherited by all the nodes in the folder.\n* Tree hierarchy: Nodes in a folder are treated as root or child nodes based on whether the folder is added to the dialog tree at the root or child level. Any root level nodes that you add to a root level folder continue to function as root nodes; they do not become child nodes of the folder, for example. However, if you move a root level node into a folder that is a child of another node, then the root node becomes a child of that other node.\n\n\n\nFolders have no impact on the order in which nodes are evaluated. Nodes continue to be processed from first to last. As your assistant travels down the tree, when it encounters a folder, if the folder has no condition or its condition is true, it immediately processes the first node in the folder, and continues down the tree in order from there. If a folder does not have a folder condition, then the folder is transparent to your assistant, and each node in the folder is treated like any other individual node in the tree.\n\n\n\n Adding a folder \n\nTo add a folder to a dialog tree, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tasks"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.6872339249,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

From the Dialog page, select any node in your dialog tree.\n2. Close the edit view if it is open for the current node.\n3.

If the skill is not associated with an assistant already, add the dialog skill to an assistant, and then view the skill tile from the main page of the assistant. The trained data section lists the number of dialog nodes.\n\nIf the total seems larger than you expected, it might be because the dialog that you build from the application is translated into a JSON object. Some fields that appear to be part of a single node are actually structured as separate dialog nodes in the underlying JSON object.\n\n\n\n* Each node and folder is represented as its own node.\n* Each conditional response that is associated with a single dialog node is represented as an individual node.\n* For a node with slots, each slot, slot found response, slot not found response, slot handler, and if set, the prompt for everything response is an individual node.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02873-3029-4764","score":0.6896528602,"text":"\n[Shows that the first node in the dialog asks which type of cupcake the user wants, gluten-free or regular, and has two child nodes that provide a different response depending on the user's answer.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/node1-children.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog flow \n\nThe dialog that you create is processed by your assistant from the first node in the tree to the last.\n\n![Arrow points down next to 3 nodes to show that dialog flows from the first node to the last](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/node-flow-down.png)\n\nAs it travels down the tree, if your assistant finds a condition that is met, it triggers that node.

You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page. This settings page is not displayed in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills because use of the legacy version of the API is no longer supported for those languages. For more information about the new system entities, see [System entities](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities).\n\n\n\n\n\n 28 October 2020 \n\nIntroducing the actions skill!\n: The actions skill is the latest step in the continuing evolution of Watson Assistant as a software as a service application. The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16364-163116-165172","score":0.7638708353,"text":"\nThis version of the tool was evaluated by beta program participants over the past several months.\n\n\n\n* Skills: What you think of as a workspace is now called a skill. A dialog skill is a container for the natural language processing training data and artifacts that enable your assistant to understand user questions, and respond to them.\n\n\n\nWhere are my workspaces? Any workspaces that you created previously are now listed in your service instance as skills. Click the Skills tab to see them. For more information, see [Adding skills to your assistant](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add).\n\n\n\n* Assistants: You can now publish your skill in just two steps. Add your skill to an assistant, and then set up one or more integrations with which to deploy your skill. The assistant adds a layer of function to your skill that enables Watson Assistant to orchestrate and manage the flow of information for you. See [Assistants](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants).\n* Built-in integrations: Instead of going to the Deploy tab to deploy your workspace, you add your dialog skill to an assistant, and add integrations to the assistant through which the skill is made available to your users. You do not need to build a custom front-end application and manage the conversation state from one call to the next. However, you can still do so if you want to. See [Adding integrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add) for more information.\n* New major API version: A V2 version of the API is available. This version provides access to methods you can use to interact with an assistant at run time.

Cloud Functions Terms\n\n Term Description \n\n Namespace [Namespaces](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-namespaces) contain Cloud Functions entities, such as actions and triggers, and belong to a resource group. You can let users access your Cloud Functions entities by granting them access to the namespace. \n Action An [action](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions) is a piece of code that performs one specific task. An action can be written in the language of your choice, such as small snippets of JavaScript or Swift code or custom binary code embedded in a Docker container. You provide your action to Cloud Functions either as source code or a Docker image. An action performs work when it is directly invoked by using the Cloud Functions API, CLI, or iOS SDK. An action can also automatically respond to events from IBM Cloud services and third-party services by using a trigger. \n Sequence A set of actions can be chained together into a [sequence](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-sequences) without having to write any code. A sequence is a chain of actions, invoked in order, where the output of one action is passed as input to the next action. By creating a sequence, you can combine existing actions together for quick and easy reuse. A sequence can then be invoked just like an action, through a REST API or automatically in response to events.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05444-96814-98116","score":0.6969524622,"text":"\n* [How Functions compare to apps and jobs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-migratefun-migrate-compare-app-job)\n* [Migrating IBM Cloud Functions Actions to Code Engine Functions FAQ](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-migratefun-migrate-faqs)\n\n\n\n* [How can I process a bulk-load of computations?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-migratefun-migrate-faq1)\n* [I used Cloud Function to include dynamic elements for my web application.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple.

The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant. For example, you might direct customers to your call center phone number or to an online support ticket form URL.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02898-0-1202","score":0.7079802155,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Planning the dialog \n\nLearn how to approach building a dialog.\n\n\n\n*  Plan out the design of the dialog that you want to build before you add a single dialog node.

Then, you create a VPC cluster that uses these VPC subnets.\n\nNote that you might have subnet conflicts between the default ranges for workers nodes, pods, and services, and the subnets in your on-premises networks.

The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15585-2974-3562","score":0.7510011792,"text":"\n* [Creating an instance group template](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-groupcreating-instance-template)\n* [Creating an instance group](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-groupcreating-instance-group)\n* [Creating scaling policies](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-groupcreating-scaling-policies)\n* [FAQs for application load balancers](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancer-faqs)\n* [FAQs for auto scale](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-faqs-auto-scale)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-lbaas-integration-with-instance-groups"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13200-7-1622","score":0.7501895428,"text":"\nInstall software on virtual server instances in VPC \n\nThis tutorial may incur costs.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.660197258,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03110-6742-7759","score":0.6426620483,"text":"\nBut given the nature of machine learning models and the nuance and subtlety of natural languages processing, you may find some discrepancies from version to version.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.67849195,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04168-7004-8282","score":0.6614052057,"text":"\n* [Learning about CIS architecture and workload isolation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-compute-isolation)\n* [Securing your data in CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-mng-data)\n* [Auditing events for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-at_events)\n* [IAM and Activity Tracker actions by API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-at_iam_CIS)\n* [Managing security and compliance with CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-security-compliance)\n\n\n\n* [Setting up Terraform for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-terraform-setup-cis)\n\n\n\n* Reference\n\n\n\n* [CIS API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cis)\n* CLI reference\n\n\n\n* [CIS CLI change log](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cli-change-log)\n* [CIS CLI reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-cli)\n\n\n\n* [Terraform](https:\/\/registry.terraform.io\/providers\/IBM-Cloud\/ibm\/latest\/docs\/resources\/cis)\n* CIS use cases\n\n\n\n* [Accessing your Cloudant database through CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-access-cloudant-through-cis)\n* [Edge functions use cases](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-edge-functions-use-cases)\n\n\n\n* [Understanding your responsibilities when using CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-responsibilities-cis)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-http-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04168-2157-3477","score":0.6485826969,"text":"\n* [What are computer networking solutions](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/learn\/networking-a-complete-guidetoc-computer-n-9C7jokVu)\n\n\n\n* How to\n\n\n\n* [Managing your CIS deployment](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment)\n* [Managing origin certificates](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-origin-certificates)\n* [Getting CIS running with a new subdomain](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-get-started-new-subdomain)\n* [Adding domains to your CIS instance](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-multi-domain-support)\n* [Setting up your Domain Name System for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-set-up-your-dns-for-cis)\n* [CIS DNS zone CNAME (partial) setup](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cname-setup)\n* [Configuring rate limiting](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-rate-limiting)\n* Working with Range applications\n\n\n\n* [Protecting TCP traffic (Range)](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-range)\n* [Enabling Proxy protocol](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-enable-proxy-protocol)\n\n\n\n* [Using service endpoints to privately connect to CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-service-endpoints)\n* Working with TLS\n\n\n\n* [Setting Transport Layer Security (TLS) options](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-options)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-http-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04111-35313-36062","score":0.6458998919,"text":"\nGet Bot Management settings.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13785-5763-7073","score":0.641997993,"text":"\n* [Protecting sensitive information in your Watson service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-keyservice)\n* [Public and private network endpoints](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-public-private-endpoints)\n* [Virtual Private Endpoints](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-virtual-private-endpoints)\n\n\n\n* Service background\n\n\n\n* [The science behind the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-science)\n* [Research references](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-references)\n\n\n\n\n\n* Reference\n\n\n\n* [API & SDK reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/text-to-speech)\n* [High availability and disaster recovery](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-ha-dr)\n* [Activity Tracker events](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-at-events)\n* [Watson SDKs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-using-sdks)\n* [Watson GitHub repos](https:\/\/github.com\/watson-developer-cloud\/)\n\n\n\n* Help\n\n\n\n* [Known limitations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-known-limitations)\n* [Usage FAQs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-faq-usage)\n* Developer community","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-usingHTTP"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04168-7004-8282","score":0.6412155032,"text":"\n* [Learning about CIS architecture and workload isolation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-compute-isolation)\n* [Securing your data in CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-mng-data)\n* [Auditing events for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-at_events)\n* [IAM and Activity Tracker actions by API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-at_iam_CIS)\n* [Managing security and compliance with CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-security-compliance)\n\n\n\n* [Setting up Terraform for CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-terraform-setup-cis)\n\n\n\n* Reference\n\n\n\n* [CIS API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cis)\n* CLI reference\n\n\n\n* [CIS CLI change log](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cli-change-log)\n* [CIS CLI reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-cli)\n\n\n\n* [Terraform](https:\/\/registry.terraform.io\/providers\/IBM-Cloud\/ibm\/latest\/docs\/resources\/cis)\n* CIS use cases\n\n\n\n* [Accessing your Cloudant database through CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-access-cloudant-through-cis)\n* [Edge functions use cases](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-edge-functions-use-cases)\n\n\n\n* [Understanding your responsibilities when using CIS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-responsibilities-cis)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-http-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12415-7-1973","score":0.6403030157,"text":"\nFAQs for Secrets Manager \n\nFAQs for IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager might include questions about secrets or credentials. To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com.

For example, several wholesalers and a set of farmers might be joined to a single channel. If a farmer and a wholesaler want to transact privately, they can create a channel for this purpose. But they can also decide to create a private data collection on the smart contract that governs their business interactions to maintain privacy over sensitive aspects of the sale, such as the price, without having to create a secondary channel. To learn more about when to use private data within a blockchain, visit the [Private Data](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-1.4\/private-data\/private-data.htmlprivate-data) concept article in the Fabric documentation.\n\nIn order to use private data with IBM Blockchain Platform, the following three conditions must be satisfied:\n\n\n\n1. Define the private data collection. A private data collection file can be added to your smart contract. Then, at run time, your client application can use private data-specific chaincode APIs to input and retrieve data from the collection. For more information about how to use private data collections with your smart contract, see the Fabric SDK tutorial on [Using private data](https:\/\/hyperledger.github.io\/fabric-sdk-node\/release-1.4\/tutorial-private-data.html) in the Fabric SDK documentation.\n2. Deploy the smart contract. After you define the smart contract private data collection, you need to install the smart contract on the peers that are members of the channel. When you instantiate the smart contract on the channel by using the console, you need to upload the collection configuration JSON file.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Container Registry benefits\n\n Benefit Description \n\n Highly available and scalable private registry.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06063-53153-55320","score":0.7792492509,"text":"\nImage Vulnerability Scanner: By default, Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index).\n4. IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center: When you enable IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center, you can view reports about suspicious incoming and outgoing network traffic. For more information, see [What is IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n5. IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager: You can store your Ingress and Kubernetes secrets in IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager. When you integrate Secrets Manager into your cluster, you set a default Secrets Manager instance where all Ingress subdomain secrets are uploaded. For more information, see [Setting up Secrets Manager in your Kubernetes Service cluster](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Image and registry \n\nEvery deployment is based on an image that holds the instructions for how to spin up the container that runs your app. These instructions include the operating system inside the container and extra software that you want to install. To protect your app, you must protect the image and establish checks to ensure the image's integrity.\n\nShould I use a public or a private registry to store my images?\n: Public registries, such as Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker images and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09410-1574-3779","score":0.7760757208,"text":"\n* IBM Cloud Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM.\n* The IBM Cloud Container Registry includes Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/home\/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05777-1455-3483","score":0.8227196932,"text":"\nYour worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16387-7-1890","score":0.669562459,"text":"\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public\/private key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

This is sufficient for identifying unique users for billing purposes, but it is not secure, because it could be modified.\n\nBy encoding user identity information as part of the JWT payload, you can authenticate users securely. The JWT is signed and cannot be modified by the user.\n\nFor more information about using JWTs for secure authentication, see [Authenticating users](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-authenticate).\n* You can [prevent unauthorized access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt) to sensitive customer information by encrypting it and including it as part of the JWT user payload.\n\nThe user payload is a part of the JWT you can use to send information you want your assistant to have access to, but that you do not want customers to see.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. For more information, see [Configuring backup call center support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-transfer-service).\n* Call failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent.\n\n\n\nIf, after you transfer the call to a human, the connection to a live agent fails for any reason, you can configure what to do.\n\n\n\n* Transfer failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller if transfer to a live agent fails. The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03312-7276-9469","score":0.6865068078,"text":"\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region.

If this option is selected, the SIP digest user name and password must be configured, and the SIP trunk being used to connect to Assistant must be configured to use only TLS.\n\nIf you use Twilio as your SIP trunk provider, you cannot enable SIP authentication for outbound SIP trunks to Watson Assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apply advanced SIP trunk configuration settings \n\n\n\n* SIP INVITE headers to extract: List headers that you want to use in your dialog.\n\nThe SIP request often sends INVITE headers with information about the request that is used by the SIP network.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phone"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16250-8881-11263","score":0.6682534814,"text":"\n* The embed script that contains your integration ID, region, service instance ID, and subscription ID (if applicable) needs be changed or updated to use the IDs for the new integration and region.\n* If you are using Salesforce or ZenDesk integrations for connecting to human agents, update the configuration within those systems to make sure they can communicate with the correct integration.

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

Using a secrets reference is the recommended method for setting the value of a secure property.\n\nWhen you set a secure property with a plain text secret value, Continuous Delivery actively encrypts and stores the value internally. Although the value is kept secure within the Continuous Delivery service, the service cannot protect the value on the client side. When you set a secure property by using the console in your browser, by calling an API, or by configuring a Terraform resource, the plain text secret might be exposed on your local systems. Plain text secrets are also more difficult to rotate. When a secret, such as an API key, must be rotated, all secure properties that carry the secret value must also be located and updated.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_data_security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12498-1639-3565","score":0.6269654036,"text":"\nWith these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them.

Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ia-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12447-4-2115","score":0.6876291037,"text":"\n* UI\n* CLI\n* API\n* Terraform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Manually rotating secrets \n\nWith IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager, you can manually create new versions of a secret by using the UI or APIs.\n\nWhen you rotate a secret in your service instance, you create a new version of its value.

Each instance of Data Engine exports its catalog as a database called default.\n\n\n\n Catalog usage within Data Engine \n\nThe Catalog can be used in Data Engine in read and write mode. Seamless access is configured without any configuration steps needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Connecting Apache Spark with Data Engine \n\nWhen you use the Hive metastore compatible interface, access is limited to read only operations. Thus, existing tables and views can be used, but not modified.\n\nDepending from where you want to connect to your catalog, the steps may vary.\n\n\n\n Usage within Watson Studio Notebooks \n\nWatson Studio has the compatible Hive metastore client already included. It also includes a convenience library to configure the connection to the Hive metastore. Set the required variables (CRN and apikey) and call the helper function to connect to the Hive metastore:\n\n change the CRN and the APIkey according to your instance\ncrn='yourDataengineCRN'\napikey='yourAPIkey'\n\nfrom dataengine import SparkSessionWithDataengine\n\n call the helper function to create a session builder equipped with the correct config\nsession_builder = SparkSessionWithDataengine.enableDataengine(crn, apikey, \"public\")\nspark = session_builder.appName(\"Spark DataEngine integration test\").getOrCreate()\n\nDisplay your tables and run an SQL statement:\n\nspark.sql('show tables').show(truncate=False)\n\n replace yourTable with a valid table. Do not use the sample tables as you do not have access to the data!\nspark.sql('select * from yourTable').show()\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage with IBM Analytics Engine \n\nThe Hive metastore client is also already included in IBM\u00ae Analytics Engine.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-hive_metastore"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13481-1627-2985","score":0.7484778166,"text":"\nDisplay your tables and run an SQL statement:\n\nspark.sql('show tables').show(truncate=False)\n\n replace yourTable with a valid table.

To sign up and view your invoices, you must provide your IBM customer number.

Review the following differences for billing based on your account type:\n\n\n\n*  Subscription: The billed interval is contractual and depends on a negotiated payment for usage credits.\n*  Pay-As-You-Go: An estimation of your charges is found on the [Usage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/usage) page.

To determine whether your service instance provides a free allocation, go to the [Resources list](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/resources) in the IBM Cloud console. Click the service name, and then click Plan. Review the feature description for each plan to see whether the service offers free allocations. Free allocations are applied to the account level and not the organization level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-understand-invoices"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02597-3131-5174","score":0.6454746723,"text":"\nPlans can share APIs, but whether subscription approval is required depends upon the Plan itself. Additionally, you can enforce rate limits through Plans or through operations within a Plan's APIs that override the Plan's rate limit.\n\nPlans can also specify billing costs for customers who use your Products. For example, you can define three different Plans for a single Product. Each Plan can have a different subscription cost and a different rate limit that targets different customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Products \n\nPlans and APIs are grouped in Products. Through Products, you can manage the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans. Use the API Designer to create, edit, and stage your Product. Use the API Manager to manage the lifecycle of your Product.\n\nThe following diagram demonstrates how Products, Plans, and APIs relate to one another. Note how Plans belong to only one Product, can possess different APIs to other Plans within the same Product, and can share APIs with Plans from any Product.

A lifecycle manager can then control the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans through the API Manager. Through the Developer Portal, the customer is then able to subscribe to one of the Plans that is available to them, as determined in the API Manager. If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-5228-7163","score":0.6397745013,"text":"\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.\n* Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing your payments \n\nIf you're a new Pay-As-You-Go account owner that is located in the US and you are paying with a credit card, you can replace your current card with a new one or edit the details of an existing card. In either case, you manage your credit card from the [Payments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/billing\/payments) page in the IBM Cloud console.\n\nIf you own one of the following accounts, in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, you can go to Manage > Billing and usage to make a one-time payment, change your credit card details, view your billing items, and manage your invoices.\n\n\n\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts based in the US with any payment method other than a credit card\n* New and existing Pay-As-You-Go accounts not based in the US\n* New and existing Subscription accounts worldwide\n\n\n\nThe process for updating a credit card requires a manual review that might take a few days to process.

Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1042894-1044946","score":0.6346357465,"text":"\nContact an [IBM Cloud Sales](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog?contactmodule) representative to request a quote for additional server bandwidth.\n* What's the difference between a Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription account?\n\nWith Pay-As-You-Go accounts, you're billed monthly for your resource usage.

Simple tier pricing table\n\n Quantity of Items Unit Price for All Items \n\n Tier 1: 1 - 1000 $1 USD \n Tier 2: 1001 - 2000 $0.90 USD \n Tier 3: 2001 - 3000 $0.75 USD \n Tier 4: 3001 - 4000 $0.60 USD \n Tier 5: > 4000 $0.40 USD \n\n\n\nThe following table illustrates how much you pay with a plan that is based on a simple tier pricing model:\n\n\n\nTable 3. Charge calculation by using the simple tier pricing model\n\n Quantity of Items Charge Calculation Total Price \n\n 500 500 \u00d7 1 = 500 $500 USD \n 1500 1500 \u00d7 0.90 = 1350 $1350 USD \n 2500 2500 \u00d7 0.75 = 1875 $1875 USD \n ... ... ... \n 5200 5200 \u00d7 0.40 = 2080 $2080 USD \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Graduated tier \n\nIn the graduated tier model, the unit price per tier decreases as your level of usage increases. The total price is the cumulative charges for each level of usage, consisting of your quantity multiplied by the unit price at that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 4. Graduated tier pricing table\n\n Quantity of Items Unit Price for Items in the Tier \n\n Tier 1: 1 - 1000 $1 USD \n Tier 2: 1001 - 2000 $0.90 USD \n Tier 3: 2001 - 3000 $0.75 USD \n Tier 4: 3001 - 4000 $0.60 USD \n Tier 5: > 4000 $0.40 USD \n\n\n\nThe following table illustrates how much you pay with a plan that is based on a graduated tier pricing model:\n\n\n\nTable 5.

If you need separate billing for different sets of buckets, then creating multiple instances is necessary.\n\nFor each storage class, billing is based on aggregated usage across all buckets at the instance level. For example, for Smart Tier, the billing is based on usage across all Smart Tier buckets in a given instance - not on the individual buckets.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Object Storage pricing \n\nStorage costs for IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage are determined by the average monthly stored volume of data, the amount of public outbound bandwidth used, and the total number of operational requests processed by the system.\n\nInfrastructure offerings are connected to a three-tiered network, segmenting public, private, and management traffic. Infrastructure services can transfer data between one another across the private network at no cost. Infrastructure offerings (such as bare metal servers, virtual servers, and cloud storage) connect to other applications and services in the IBM Cloud Platform catalog (such as Watson services and Cloud Foundry runtimes) across the public network, so data transfer between those two types of offerings is metered and charged at standard public network bandwidth rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Request classes \n\n'Class A' requests involve modification or listing. This category includes creating buckets, uploading or copying objects, creating or changing configurations, listing buckets, and listing the contents of buckets.\n\n'Class B' requests are related to retrieving objects or their associated metadata or configurations from the system.\n\nDeleting buckets or objects from the system does not incur a charge.

You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page. You can download your latest invoice with all discounts and charges here or from the Invoices page.\n\nNow that you've walked through the common billing options and how to delegate billing administrator capabilities, track usage, and pay your bill, you're ready to start deciding what is best for your account. As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-3313-5682","score":0.6304809451,"text":"\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period.

No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

The set of virtual server instances that you provision to your reserved capacity must be the same size as your reservation.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Is my payment upfront or monthly? \n\nReserved capacity and instances are purchased for a 1 or 3-year term. After that point, you're committed to a monthly payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n  What happens at the end of my contract? \n\nDepending on whether you choose hourly or monthly billing, the billing price for the CPU and RAM converts to the current list price, with any account discounts applied. Contact your sales representative, who in turn works with your global sales manager to determine end-of-contract options such as renewal or restructuring of your contract provisions.

Primary disk and no-additional charge network or storage products are not included in your reservation. More network bandwidth, storage capacity, OS, and third-party software are charged on an hourly or monthly basis, which depends on the instance type.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Why do I need to choose hourly or monthly billing on the virtual server instance? \n\nYour additional software, storage, and network selections need to be billed either hourly or monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-faqs-reserved-capacity-and-instances"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-3313-5682","score":0.6464884877,"text":"\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-807613-809619","score":0.6861781478,"text":"\nBilling stops after (1) you request a circuit to be deleted, and (2) the provider has de-provisioned the circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n What extra charges will I incur from other parties with Direct Link? \n\nYou might have extra charges from your provider.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10906-18114-19892","score":0.6613073945,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Understanding compliance in IBM Cloud](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-compliance). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Manage billing and usage \n\nAccount owners and users with the administrator role on the [billing account management service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-account-services&interface=uibilling-acct-mgmt) have access to monitor and manage billing, usage, invoices, payments, and more.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) charges aren't included.\n\n\n\nThird-party services, such as SendGrid, don't bill for their service through IBM Cloud if you signed up for their service outside of IBM Cloud.\n\nAn IBM Cloud service might provide a free allocation before the start of your billing period. To determine whether your service instance provides a free allocation, go to the [Resources list](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/resources) in the IBM Cloud console. Click the service name, and then click Plan. Review the feature description for each plan to see whether the service offers free allocations. Free allocations are applied to the account level and not the organization level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-understand-invoices"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12791-80048-82089","score":0.6667456031,"text":"\nBilling \n\nYou can give users access to update account settings, view subscriptions, view offers, apply subscription and feature codes, update spending limits, and track usage by using the Billing service.\n\n\n\nTable 3.
