This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_38877-39736-0-859", "score": 47.267463010133916, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases .

They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis , since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria .

Santa Barbara 's weather was ranked number 1 in the United States in 2018 by US News and World Report . Because the city lies along the ocean and parallel to the predominant westerly winds , sideshore and light onshore breezes moderate temperatures resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places farther inland . In the winter , storms reach California , some of which bring heavy rainfall but the rainshadow effect of the coastal mountains can at times moderate or enhance the rainfall depending on local storm wind flows . Local rainfall totals can be enhanced by orographic lift when storms are accompanied by southerly flow pushing moist air over the Santa Ynez mountains , producing greater rainfall than in other coastal areas . Summers in Southern California are mostly rainless due to the presence of a high - pressure area over the eastern Pacific , but summer showers can happen due to tropical hurricane / Monsoonal flows that rarely reach Santa Barbara . In the fall , afternoon or evening downslope winds , locally called `` Sundowners '' , can raise temperatures into the high 90s and drop humidities into the single digits , increasing the chance due to downed powerlines etc. and severity of wildfires in the foothills north of the city .

Steve Trevor makes his first live - action theatrical appearance in Wonder Woman , portrayed by Chris Pine , who has signed on for a multi-picture deal . The film places Steve Trevor in the role of partner / love interest , as a fellow warrior , like he was portrayed in the original comics . This version of Trevor , a United States Army Air Service 94th Aero Squadron pilot with the American Expeditionary Forces , is a captain and an Allied spy in World War I who has stolen information from a weapons facility in the Ottoman Empire run by German general Erich Ludendorff , whose scientist Doctor Maru is producing a new , deadlier form of mustard gas . Diana goes with Steve to take part in the War , and he acts as her guide into the world outside of Themyscira and how mankind functions . The two grow closer along the way , but are conflicted when Steve is more focused on stopping Doctor Maru 's bombs and Diana thinks that killing Ares will stop the war . In the climax , Steve hijacks a German strategic bomber containing the gas and sacrifices himself to incinerate it at a safe distance , his last words being to tell Diana that he can save today while she could save the world and tells her that he loves her , leaving her with his father 's watch as a keepsake before he jumps onto the plane . His sacrifice leads Diana to believe that ultimately the world can only be saved through love , not hatred . In 2017 , Bruce Wayne retrieves the original group photo and his father 's watch and returns it to Diana , who sends him an email thanking him for bringing Steve back to her .

The seat is typically surrounded by a curtain of some sort to allow for some privacy and help avoid outside interference during the photo session . Once the payment is made , the photo booth will take a series of photographs , although most modern booths may only take a single photograph and print out a series of identical pictures . Before each photograph , there will be an indication , such as a light or a buzzer , that will signal the patron to prepare their pose . After the last photograph in the series ( typically between 3 and 8 ) has been taken , the photo booth begins developing the film -- a process that used to take several minutes in the old `` wet chemistry '' booths , but is now typically accomplished in about 30 seconds with digital technology . The prints are then delivered to the customer . Typical dimensions of these prints vary .

By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons . Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops , but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation . The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks . Marine pilots , like all aviators , fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority ; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops . On the other hand , the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own . Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces ; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield . The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards ahead . In 1944 , after considerable internal acrimony , Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out . At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party ( ALP ) not only requested air support , but actually directed it in tactical detail . The Marine formula increased responsiveness , reduced `` friendly '' casualties , and ( flying weather permitting ) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery . For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation , provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed - wing fighters or bombers , although the Army was allowed to have some unarmed transports and spotter planes .

The season premiere , `` New Guys '' received a 2.1 / 6 percent share in the Nielsen ratings among viewers aged 18 to 49 , meaning that 2.1 percent of viewers aged 18 to 49 watched the episode , and 6 percent of viewers watching television at the time watched the episode . The episode was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and became the lowest - rated season premiere for the series . In addition , it marked a 46 percent drop in viewership from the season eight premiere `` The List '' . For the first sixteen episodes , the series was able to maintain roughly 4 million viewers . However , starting with the seventeenth episode `` The Farm '' , ratings began to drop below this threshold . The series hit an all - time low with the twentieth episode , `` Paper Airplane '' , which was viewed by only 3.25 million viewers , and received a 1.7 rating / 5 percent share . The series finale was viewed by 5.69 million viewers and received a 3.0 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This made it the highest - rated episode of the season ; it also marked an increase in the previous season finale , which garnered only 4.49 million viewers . `` Finale '' was the most watched episode of The Office since the eighth season episode `` Pool Party '' , but ranked as the third - least watched finale of the series , following the eighth - and first - season finales . Although in its ninth season , The Office no longer was NBC 's highest - rated scripted comedy series -- it was surpassed by Go On -- it often ranked as the highest - rated scripted NBC series on Thursday nights .

Patel , a fierce critic of Jinnah 's demand that the Hindu - majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state , obtained the partition of those provinces , thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan . Patel 's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public , which had tired of the League 's tactics , but he was criticised by Gandhi , Nehru , secular Muslims and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so . When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947 , Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal . Knowing Gandhi 's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition , Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over the perceived practical unworkability of any Congress - League coalition , the rising violence and the threat of civil war .

In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur . Based on population genetic models , Galvani and Slatkin ( 2003 ) argue that the intermittent nature of plague epidemics did not generate a sufficiently strong selective force to drive the allele frequency of CCR5 \u039432 to 10 % in Europe .", "title": "CCR5", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "855533381_48892-49455-0-563", "score": 35.33767104283897, "text": "Virus\nMost researchers believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century ; it is now a pandemic , with an estimated 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide .

Some historians believe that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare , crime , popular revolt , waves of flagellants , and persecution . The Black Death originated in Central Asia and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries . Arab historians Ibn Al - Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia . Chinese records also showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s . Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region , where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia . The Mongols had cut off the trade route , the Silk Road , between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe . The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants ' last trading station in the region , Caffa in the Crimea . In late 1346 , plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town . When spring arrived , the Italian merchants fled on their ships , unknowingly carrying the Black Death . Carried by the fleas on rats , the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another .", "title": "Bubonic plague", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

The virus can not pass through a synthetic condom , but a male condom 's effectiveness is limited because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it . Neither type of condom prevents contact with the scrotum , anus , buttocks , or upper thighs , areas that may come in contact with ulcers or genital secretions during sexual activity . Protection against herpes simplex depends on the site of the ulcer ; therefore , if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms , abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission .

Some see Romeo 's supposed love for Rosaline as childish as compared with his true love for Juliet .

Since Shakespeare is thought to have written early drafts of the play in 1591 , and then picked them up again in 1597 to create the final copy , the change in Romeo 's language for Rosaline and Juliet may mirror Shakespeare 's increased skill as a playwright : the younger Shakespeare describing Rosaline , and the more experienced describing Juliet .

'' Under Campbell 's proposal , the NHL champion would have played the WHA champion for the right to face the European champion . Campbell 's two main conditions were that Stanley Cup was to remain the NHL 's championship trophy and that the world championship would be strictly limited to professional teams . The latter condition was the more contentious one , as it would have caused problems especially for Eastern Bloc teams wanting to challenge for such a championship -- these teams employed various legal fictions to maintain the nominal amateur status of their top players . The NHL 's critics questioned the seriousness of Campbell 's idea and argued that NHL owners had no intention of ever playing for a world championship . The International Ice Hockey Federation soon made clear that it would never sanction any sort of `` world championship '' in which teams from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia were barred from participating , and the top openly professional European leagues were unwilling to consider taking part in any tournament not sanctioned by the IIHF . In the end , Campbell 's proposal went nowhere -- eventually , the NHL resolved the WHA challenge by agreeing to merge with its rival , by which time the older league had quietly withdrawn its support for the idea .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

Next , the male and female begin to circle each other . If the male has competitors , the female may let the males struggle with each other .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_32203-33897-0-1694", "score": 43.51436715894784, "text": "Infertility\nHigh costs may also be a factor and research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology , in Belgium , claimed a much lower cost methodology ( about 90 % reduction ) with similar efficacy , which may be suitable for some fertility treatment .

Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible . Additionally , counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment , and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well . While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations ( such as sub-Saharan African countries ) , a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention .

These injections may be self - administered on a daily basis for a period of one to three weeks . Next , follicle - stimulating hormones ( FSH ) are given to the donor to stimulate egg production and increases the number of mature eggs produced by the ovaries . Throughout the cycle the donor is monitored often by a physician using blood tests and ultrasound exams to determine the donor 's reaction to the hormones and the progress of follicle growth .", "title": "Egg donation", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801197945_33418-34806-0-1388", "score": 30.002319494263162, "text": "Egg donation\nDonor profiles presented on agency websites are their primary marketing tool to find recipients and learn what these future consumers want .

Infertile couples may resort to egg donation when the female partner can not have genetic children because her own eggs can not generate a viable pregnancy , or because they could generate a viable pregnancy but the chances are so low that it is not advisable or not financially feasible to do IVF with her own eggs . This situation is often , but not always based on advanced reproductive age . It can also be due to early onset of menopause , which can occur as early as their 20s . In addition , some women are born without ovaries , while some women 's reproductive organs have been damaged or surgically removed due to disease or other circumstances . Another indication would be a genetic disorder on part of the woman that either renders her infertile or would be dangerous for any offspring , problems that can be circumvented by using eggs from another woman . Many women have none of these issues , but continue to be unsuccessful using their own eggs -- in other words , they have undiagnosed infertility -- and thus turn to donor eggs or donor embryos .

The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast .

Her decision was initially ridiculed by both her friends as well as actor Adam Sandler , a Saturday Night Live alum . Actress T\u00e9a Leoni , who at the time was being referred to by the media as `` the next Lucille Ball '' , was offered the role of Rachel as the studio 's first choice , but she declined in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth . Actress Elizabeth Berkley also auditioned for the role prior to being cast in the teen sitcom Saved by the Bell . Other actresses who auditioned for Rachel include Denise Richards , Melissa Rivers , Nicollette Sheridan , Parker Posey , and Jami Gertz . Originally , the producers wanted to cast actress Courteney Cox as Rachel , who Crane and Kauffman were particularly drawn to because of her `` cheery , upbeat energy . '' Additionally , Cox was the most famous cast member at the time amidst an ensemble of relatively unknown actors . However , the actress lobbied for the role of Rachel 's best friend Monica , as whom she was ultimately cast , because she felt that she was not `` quirky '' enough to play Rachel . At the same time , although unbeknownst to each other , Aniston was being considered for the role of Monica , but fought to play Rachel because she felt that the character suited her better .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time .

At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc .

Koch ) which places the emergence of Celtic culture in Britain much earlier , in the Bronze Age , and credits its spread not to invasion , but due to a gradual emergence in situ out of Proto - Indo - European culture ( perhaps introduced to the region by the Bell Beaker People , and enabled by an extensive network of contacts that existed between the peoples of Britain and Ireland and those of the Atlantic seaboard .", "title": "Celts", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "806502664_3901-4281-0-380", "score": 28.795156449589925, "text": "Primary source\nA study of cultural history could include fictional sources such as novels or plays .

When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West , European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial `` Great Wall '' in his Travels . Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

At this point , the largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass , where the Great Wall meets the Bohai Sea . Its defender Wu Sangui , wedged between the Shun army within and the Manchus without , decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates for them .

These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders . Once the Xiongnu were chased away , Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories .", "title": "History of the Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 , which provided for comprehensive planning , technical services , research , and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure . The Act was amended in 1965 , establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so . Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s , in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns . In 1970 EPA was created by the Richard Nixon administration , and authority for managing various environmental programs was transferred to the new agency . In 1972 , Congress passed the Clean Water Act , requiring industrial plants and municipal sewage plants to proactively improve their waste treatment practices in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources . In 1974 , the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems . This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed . From then on , drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal , state , and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations . The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion in research and construction grants for municipal sewage treatment . The funds initially provided an incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure for municipalities , instead of decentralized systems . However , the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems , and financial assistance was made available for such alternatives . In the mid-1990s decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population , and approximately 37 percent of new housing developments .", "title": "Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "834226571_5404-6019-0-615", "score": 40.922903136014924, "text": "Storm drain\nMost catchbasins will contain stagnant water during the drier parts of the year , and can , in warm countries , be used by mosquitos for breeding .

This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 , which provided for comprehensive planning , technical services , research , and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure . The Act was amended in 1965 , establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so . Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s , in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns . In 1970 EPA was created by the Richard Nixon administration , and authority for managing various environmental programs was transferred to the new agency . In 1972 , Congress passed the Clean Water Act , requiring industrial plants and municipal sewage plants to proactively improve their waste treatment practices in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources . In 1974 , the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems . This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed . From then on , drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal , state , and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations . The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion in research and construction grants for municipal sewage treatment . The funds initially provided an incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure for municipalities , instead of decentralized systems . However , the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems , and financial assistance was made available for such alternatives . In the mid-1990s decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population , and approximately 37 percent of new housing developments .", "title": "Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 .
