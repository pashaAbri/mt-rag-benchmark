This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_14755-15684-0-929", "score": 21.802889, "text": "Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_45056-45809-0-753", "score": 28.199554, "text": "Guinea pig\nAndean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat , and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy .

Based on seven critiques , review aggregation website Metacritic gave the ninth season of the show a 64 out of 100 rating , which denotes `` generally favorable reviews '' . Entertainment website Holy Moly named the series one of the best shows during the 2012 -- 13 season , writing that `` this final season of The Office has been great '' largely due to the fact that `` every single relationship in the show rings true with the audience . '' Michael Tedder of Vulture commented that he was `` willing to call it the fourth best season of the show overall , which is by no means faint praise . '' He explained that this was largely due to the fact that the `` final season was a chance to see how everyone else would end up '' . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that `` the tension between Jim and Pam in the final season ended up being highly controversial for a number of reasons ... but it also provided the most hopeful moments of the series ' final stretch '' ( although he did note that it was clear that the writers had `` blatantly '' set up the drama ) . He concluded that the finale was able to successfully return the series `` to what had always been its heart -- to have true fulfillment '' . Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the season an 8.5 out of 10 , denoting a `` great '' year . She felt that the character growth in the final few episodes was particularly well executed , and the last stretch of the season helped raise it after a rocky start ; ultimately , she felt that the writers were able to craft the proper ending for the show . She was , however , critical of Andy 's characterization , noting that he was merely used as a plot device when convenient . Many critics argued that the season was an improvement , in both writing and humor , over the previous season .", "title": "The Office (U.S. season 9)", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

Patel guided the Congress ministries that had won power across India with the aim of preserving party discipline -- Patel feared that the British would take advantage of opportunities to create conflict among elected Congressmen , and he did not want the party to be distracted from the goal of complete independence . Patel clashed with Nehru , opposing declarations of the adoption of socialism at the 1936 Congress session , which he believed was a diversion from the main goal of achieving independence .

The site of Constantinople , previously known as Byzantium , had been acknowledged for its strategic importance already decades prior by emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla . In contrast , the Western Empire was more fragmented . Its capital was transferred to Ravenna in 402 largely for defensive reasons , and it had easy access to the imperial fleet of the Eastern Empire but was isolated in other aspects as it was surrounded by swamps and marshes . This isolation was intentional , as Ravenna had been chosen as capital due to being more defensible against the increasing barbarian incursions . The economic power remained focused on Rome and its hyper - rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of Italy and Africa in particular . After Gallienus banned senators from army commands in the mid-3rd century , the senatorial elite lost all experience of -- and interest in -- military life . In the early 5th century the wealthy landowning elite of the Roman Senate largely barred its tenants from military service , but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend the entire Western Empire . The West 's most important military area had been northern Gaul and the Rhine frontier in the 4th century , when Trier frequently served as the capital of the Empire and many leading Western generals were Barbarians . After the civil war in 394 between Theodosius I and the usurper Eugenius , the new Western government installed by Theodosius I increasingly had to divert military resources from Britain and the Rhine to protect Italy . This , in turn , led to further rebellions and civil wars because the Western imperial government was not providing the military protection the northern provinces expected and needed against the barbarians .", "title": "Western Roman Empire", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "804622010_7457-8259-0-800", "score": 29.939215, "text": "Byzantine Empire\nThe first use of the term `` Byzantine '' to label the later years of the Roman Empire was in 1557 , when the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Histori\u00e6 Byzantin\u00e6 , a collection of historical sources .

In contrast , the Western Empire was more fragmented . Its capital was transferred to Ravenna in 402 largely for defensive reasons , and it had easy access to the imperial fleet of the Eastern Empire but was isolated in other aspects as it was surrounded by swamps and marshes . This isolation was intentional , as Ravenna had been chosen as capital due to being more defensible against the increasing barbarian incursions . The economic power remained focused on Rome and its hyper - rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of Italy and Africa in particular . After Gallienus banned senators from army commands in the mid-3rd century , the senatorial elite lost all experience of -- and interest in -- military life . In the early 5th century the wealthy landowning elite of the Roman Senate largely barred its tenants from military service , but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend the entire Western Empire . The West 's most important military area had been northern Gaul and the Rhine frontier in the 4th century , when Trier frequently served as the capital of the Empire and many leading Western generals were Barbarians . After the civil war in 394 between Theodosius I and the usurper Eugenius , the new Western government installed by Theodosius I increasingly had to divert military resources from Britain and the Rhine to protect Italy .

However , HIV - 1 was effectively absent from Europe until the late 1980s . Therefore , given the average age of roughly 1000 years for the CCR5 - \u039432 allele , it can be established that HIV - 1 did not exert selection pressure on the human population for long enough to achieve the current frequencies . Hence , other pathogens have been suggested agents of positive selection for CCR5 \u039432 . The first major one being bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) , and later , smallpox ( Variola major ) . Other data suggest that the allele frequency resulted as a negative selection pressure as a result of pathogens that became more widespread during Roman expansion .

In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays . Some of Shakespeare 's plays , particularly the history plays , were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto ( i.e. pamphlet ) form ; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition .", "title": "Shakespeare's reputation", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

Fertility problems affect one in seven couples in the UK . Most couples ( about 84 % ) who have regular sexual intercourse ( that is , every two to three days ) and who do not use contraception get pregnant within a year . About 92 out of 100 couples who are trying to get pregnant do so within two years . Women become less fertile as they get older . For women aged 35 , about 94 % who have regular unprotected sexual intercourse get pregnant after three years of trying . For women aged 38 , however , only about 77 % . The effect of age upon men 's fertility is less clear .

However , about one in five cases of infertility has no clear diagnosed cause .

Infertile couples may resort to egg donation when the female partner can not have genetic children because her own eggs can not generate a viable pregnancy , or because they could generate a viable pregnancy but the chances are so low that it is not advisable or not financially feasible to do IVF with her own eggs . This situation is often , but not always based on advanced reproductive age . It can also be due to early onset of menopause , which can occur as early as their 20s . In addition , some women are born without ovaries , while some women 's reproductive organs have been damaged or surgically removed due to disease or other circumstances . Another indication would be a genetic disorder on part of the woman that either renders her infertile or would be dangerous for any offspring , problems that can be circumvented by using eggs from another woman . Many women have none of these issues , but continue to be unsuccessful using their own eggs -- in other words , they have undiagnosed infertility -- and thus turn to donor eggs or donor embryos .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ?

But while ancient Egypt became patrimony of the West , modern Egypt remained a part of the Muslim world .

Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

Once the Xiongnu were chased away , Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories .", "title": "History of the Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801328598_18821-19699-0-878", "score": 35.850887, "text": "History of the Great Wall of China\nDetails of the construction were not found in the official histories , but it could be inferred that the construction conditions were made especially difficult by the long stretches of mountains and semi-desert that the Great Wall traversed , the sparse populations of these areas , and the frigid winter climate .

Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick , but is more difficult to use . Consequently , stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation , inner and outer brims , and gateways of the wall . Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall , with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm ( 12 in ) tall , and about 23 cm ( 9.1 in ) wide . From the parapets , guards could survey the surrounding land . Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall , including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements , was of high importance .

In return for the Soviet Union 's entrance into the war against Japan , the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island .

Against Soviet pressure , Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war .

The Roosevelt administration was unwilling to reverse policy , and Secretary of State Hull blocked a potential summit between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe . After diplomatic efforts to end the embargo failed , the Privy Council of Japan authorized a strike against the United States . The Japanese believed that the destruction of the United States Asiatic Fleet ( stationed in the Philippines ) United States Pacific Fleet ( stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii ) was vital to the conquest of Southeast Asia . On the morning of December 7 , 1941 , the Japanese struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack , knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians . At the same time , separate Japanese task forces attacked Thailand , British Hong Kong , the Philippines , and other targets . Roosevelt called for war in his famous `` Infamy Speech '' to Congress , in which he said : `` Yesterday , December 7 , 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan . '' In a nearly unanimous vote , Congress declared war on Japan . After the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor , antiwar sentiment in the United States largely evaporated overnight .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .

In its place , two general types of football evolved : `` kicking '' games and `` running '' ( or `` carrying '' ) games . A hybrid of the two , known as the `` Boston game '' , was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club .
