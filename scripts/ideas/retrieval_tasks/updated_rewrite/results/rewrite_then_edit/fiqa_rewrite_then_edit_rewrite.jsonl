However, if the points were earned on a personal credit card and used for business-related expenses, the employer can reimburse the employee for those expenses, and it seems the IRS follows an unofficial \"don't ask, don't tell\" rule regarding any rewards or cashback earned on the employee's personal card. It's important to note that credit card fees for personal expenses are not tax-deductible, while fees for business credit cards are deductible on Schedule C or the appropriate form for reporting business income and expenses. If you have a card used for both business and personal expenses, it's advisable to get separate cards for clarity and ease of accounting. In summary, while the expenses themselves may not be deductible when using credit card points, the employer can reimburse the employee for the expenses, and having separate cards for business and personal use is recommended,"}
