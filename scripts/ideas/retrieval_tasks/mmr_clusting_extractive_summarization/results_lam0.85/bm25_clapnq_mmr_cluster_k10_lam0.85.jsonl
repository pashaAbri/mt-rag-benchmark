The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

The German word for them is Meerschweinchen , literally `` little sea pig '' , which has been translated into Polish as \u015bwinka morska , into Hungarian as tengerimalac , and into Russian as \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 .

Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) .

Many municipalities have revised their local ordinances covering management of runoff . State government facilities , such as roads and highways , are also subject to the stormwater management regulations . Many local municipalities have placed ordinances for both commercial and residential stormwater management practices to be designed , implemented , and approved before an occupancy permit is released .", "title": "Storm drain", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801408202_1409-2157-0-748", "score": 20.27941204944789, "text": "Cradle of civilization\nScholars have defined civilization using various criteria such as the use of writing , cities , a class - based society , agriculture , animal husbandry , public buildings , metallurgy , and monumental architecture .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_3763-4293-0-530", "score": 20.24495555723102, "text": "Infertility\n`` Infertility is `` a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse ( and there is no other reason , such as breastfeeding or postpartum amenorrhoea ) .

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West , European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial `` Great Wall '' in his Travels . Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

Several economic historians have criticized this argument , such as Prasannan Parthasarathi who pointed to earnings data that show real wages in 18th - century Bengal and Mysore were higher than in Britain . Workers in the textile industry , for example , earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain , while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore .

The English biologist William Bateson used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern . The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers , including Smith Ely Jelliffe , to attempt to trace and connect family members of previous studies . Jelliffe collected information from across New York and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in New England . Jelliffe 's research roused the interest of his college friend , Charles Davenport , who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the East Coast of the United States of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees . Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD ; he claimed that most cases of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals . This research was further embellished in 1932 by P.R. Vessie , who popularized the idea that three brothers who left England in 1630 bound for Boston were the progenitors of HD in the USA . The claim that the earliest progenitors had been established and eugenic bias of Muncey 's , Davenport 's , and Vessie 's work contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD .

While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys , there have been six ( 6 ) exceptions : the Dallas Cowboys during Super Bowl XIII and XXVII , the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII , the Pittsburgh Steelers during Super Bowl XL , the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl 50 , and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII . The Cowboys , since 1964 , have worn white jerseys at home . The Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992 , continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000 , then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007 . Meanwhile , the Steelers , who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL -- NFL merger in 1970 , opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road , wearing white . The Steelers ' decision was compared with the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX ; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season , but after winning road playoff games against the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins wearing red jerseys , New England opted to switch to crimson for the Super Bowl as the designated home team . For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50 , Denver general manager John Elway simply stated , `` We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms '' ; they previously had been 0 -- 4 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys . The Broncos ' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition , losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion . It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII . During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady , New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games , but have worn white for a home game in the 2008 , 2010 , and 2011 seasons . The New England Patriots were 3 - 0 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls prior to Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady , and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game .", "title": "Super Bowl", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801828967_43370-44057-0-687", "score": 45.254838321208176, "text": "Atlanta\nThe Atlanta Falcons have played in Atlanta since their inception in 1966 .

Leveen suggested that during the 18th century , David Garrick chose to use a balcony in his adaptation and revival of Romeo and Juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition .", "title": "Romeo and Juliet", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "806376271_61081-62730-0-1649", "score": 41.971960154035855, "text": "Romeo and Juliet\nThe play has been widely adapted for TV and film .

The play 's director , the Shakespearean scholar Fang Ping who had suffered during the Cultural Revolution for studying this `` bourgeois Western imperialist '' , stated in an interview at the time that King Lear was relevant in China because King Lear , the `` highest ruler of a monarchy '' created a world full of cruelty and chaos where those who loved him were punished and those who did not were rewarded , a barely veiled reference to the often capricious behavior of Mao , who punished his loyal followers for no apparent reason . Cordeilia 's devotion and love for her father - despite his madness , cruelty and rejection of her - is seen in China as affirming traditional Confucian values where love of the family counts above all , and for this reason , King Lear is seen in China as being a very `` Chinese '' play that affirms the traditional values of filial piety .", "title": "Shakespeare's reputation", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "854199200_7540-8693-0-1153", "score": 21.089989537380347, "text": "Shakespeare's influence\nShakespeare is cited as an influence on a large number of writers in the following centuries , including major novelists such as Herman Melville , Charles Dickens , Thomas Hardy and William Faulkner .

In fact , Shakespeare so influenced Melville that the novel 's main antagonist , Captain Ahab , is a classic Shakespearean tragic figure , `` a great man brought down by his faults . '' Shakespeare has also influenced a number of English poets , especially Romantic poets such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge who were obsessed with self - consciousness , a modern theme Shakespeare anticipated in plays such as Hamlet .

Once released , Patel served as interim Congress president , but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Mumbai . After the signing of the Gandhi -- Irwin Pact , Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi -- here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties . It advocated the establishment of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat . Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London , Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened , and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail . During this term of imprisonment , Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other , and the two developed a close bond of affection , trust , and frankness . Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother ( Gandhi ) and his younger brother ( Patel ) . Despite having arguments with Gandhi , Patel respected his instincts and leadership . In prison , the two discussed national and social issues , read Hindu epics , and cracked jokes . Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit . Gandhi 's secretary , Mahadev Desai , kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel . When Gandhi embarked on a fast - unto - death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables , Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food .

In Hells Canyon , a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river 's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance . Finally , a third cascade of dams , from Hells Canyon to the mouth , facilitates navigation .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years .

However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends .

'' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc .

However , he was replaced in the show in 1967 after the end of the first season . As one of the few Orthodox Jewish actors working in Hollywood , he made it clear in advance of production that he was not able to work on the Sabbath ( i.e. , sundown Friday to dusk Saturday ) , and that he would leave the set every Friday before sundown . However , despite Hill 's advance warnings , the show 's producers were unprepared for his rigid adherence to the Sabbath , and on at least one occasion , Hill left the set while an episode was still in the midst of filming . The producers used a number of ways of reducing the role of Hill 's character Dan Briggs whereby his character would only obtain and hand out the mission details at the start of certain episodes being unable to take further part as he was known to people they would encounter ( used at least three times ) , or Briggs would need to don a disguise and another actor would then play his role incognito until the conclusion of the mission ( and episode ) when Briggs peeled off a face mask . On other occasions , Briggs was waiting to pick up the team at the end .

Actually , it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government ( i.e. , one directly chosen by all the people subject to it ) . Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature , Locke points to its good points . It is free , if full of continual dangers ( 2nd Tr. , \u00a7 123 ) .

'' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc .

As a pilot enters a turn , hair cells in the semicircular canals are stimulated , telling the brain that the aircraft , and the pilot , are no longer moving in a straight line but rather making a banked turn . If the pilot were to sustain a constant rate turn , the endolymph would eventually catch up with the ducts and cease to deflect the cupula . The pilot would no longer feel as if the aircraft was in a turn . As the pilot exits the turn , the semicircular canals are stimulated to make the pilot think that they are now turning in the opposite direction rather than flying straight and level . In response to this , the pilot will often lean in the direction of the original turn in an attempt to compensate for this illusion . A more serious form of this is called a graveyard spiral . Rather than the pilot leaning in the direction of the original turn , they may actually reenter the turn .

By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons . Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops , but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation . The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks . Marine pilots , like all aviators , fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority ; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops . On the other hand , the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own . Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces ; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield . The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards ahead . In 1944 , after considerable internal acrimony , Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out . At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party ( ALP ) not only requested air support , but actually directed it in tactical detail . The Marine formula increased responsiveness , reduced `` friendly '' casualties , and ( flying weather permitting ) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery . For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation , provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed - wing fighters or bombers , although the Army was allowed to have some unarmed transports and spotter planes .
