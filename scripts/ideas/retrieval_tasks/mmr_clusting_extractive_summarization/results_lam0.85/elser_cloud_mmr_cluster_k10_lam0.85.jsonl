Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port.

As such, an update has been made to the algorithm so that accented and non-accented versions of words are treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever, for some languages like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word barri\u00f3, which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb barrer (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word barrio (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts.

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word \u201cimmutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption.

A Content-MD5 header is required to ensure data integrity, and is automatically sent when using an SDK.\n\n\n\n Add a retention policy on an existing bucket \n\nThis implementation of the PUT operation uses the protection query parameter to set the retention parameters for an existing bucket. This operation allows you to set or change the minimum, default, and maximum retention period. This operation also allows you to change the protection state of the bucket.\n\nObjects written to a protected bucket cannot be deleted until the protection period has expired and all legal holds on the object are removed. The bucket's default retention value is given to an object unless an object-specific value is provided when the object is created. Objects in protected buckets that are no longer under retention (retention period has expired and the object does not have any legal holds), when overwritten, will again come under retention. The new retention period can be provided as part of the object overwrite request or the default retention time of the bucket will be given to the object.\n\nThe minimum and maximum supported values for the retention period settings MinimumRetention, DefaultRetention, and MaximumRetention are a minimum of 0 days and a maximum of 365243 days (1000 years).\n\nA Content-MD5 header is required. This operation does not make use of extra query parameters.\n\nFor more information about endpoints, see [Endpoints and storage locations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpointsendpoints)\n\nSyntax\n\nPUT https://{endpoint}/{bucket-name}?protection= path style\nPUT https://{bucket-name}.{endpoint}?protection= virtual host style\n\nExample request", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutable"}]}

In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and IBM Cloud service on the private backbone. VPE for VPC gives you the experience of controlling all the private addressing within your cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Variation with edge/transit VPC for public internet access \n\nYou might want to allow consumers to access your service through the public internet.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\nAll Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by Hyper Protect Crypto Services. For more information, see [Encryption at rest](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-at-rest).

For example, it lemmatizing words, removes stop words, and adds query expansions. The search is performed and the resulting documents and passages are returned.\n\nAnswer finding is applied to the returned passages. Up to 60 passages are sent to the answer-finding service. How these 60 passages are chosen differs based on the passages.per_document parameter value.\n\n\n\n* If passages.per_document is false, the top 60 passages from all of the documents that are returned by search are chosen based on their passage scores only.\n* If passages.per_document is true, the returned documents are ranked first, and then the top 60 passages from these top documents are chosen.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07098-8412-9823", "score": 9.365607, "text": "\nTo find answers within a single known document (for example, a document review application with long, complex documents):\n\n\n\n* Set passages.enabled to true\n* Set passages.find_answers to true\n* Set filter to select the document_id for the document\n\n\n\nThe following example shows a query that uses this API:\n\nPOST /v2/projects/{project_id}/query{\n\"natural_language_query\": \"Why did Nixon resign?\",\n\"passages\": {\n\"enabled\": true, \"find_answers\":true\n}\n}\n\nExample response:\n\n{\n\"matching_results\": 74, \"retrieval_details\": { \"document_retrieval_strategy\": \"untrained\"},\n\"results\": [\n{\n\"document_id\": \"63919442-7d5b-4cae-ab7e-56f58b1390fe\",\n\"result_metadata\":{\"collection_id\": \"collection_id1234\",\"document_retrieval_source\":\"search\",\"confidence\": 0.78214},\n\"metadata\": {\"parent_document_id\": \"63919442-7d5b-4cae-ab7e-56f58b1390fg\"},\n\"title\": \"Watergate scandal\",\n\"document_passages\":\n{\n\"passage_text\": \"With his complicity in the cover-up made public and his political support completely eroded, Nixon resigned from office on August 9, 1974.

No passages are chosen from the remaining 70 documents.\n\n\n\nIf your goal is to get the best 10 short answers, a good approach is to give the answer-finding feature various passages from more documents than just the top 10. To do so, set passages.per_document to true, and then request 20 documents and up to 3 passages from each document with the answer-finding feature enabled. The answer-finding feature searches for answers in up to 20*3 = 60 passages.\n\nAnswer finding does not use the transformed query string that is generated by query analysis. Instead, it uses a copy of the user's original input that is stored at query time to find the best short answer. If the answer-finding module is confident that it found an answer in one of the passages, the answer confidence score is combined with the document and passage scores to produce a final ranking, which can promote a document or passage that might otherwise be missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Answer-finding API details \n\nThe answer-finding API adds the following parameters to the passage section of the query API:\n\n\n\n* find_answers is optional and defaults to false.

Service bindings are the representation of an association between an application and a service instance, which often include the credentials that the application uses to communicate with the service instance. Providing valid metadata values creates a successful REST API response when a request is performed.\n\nIBM Cloud uses the Open Service Broker API (OSB) version 2.12 specification. Read through and familiarize yourself with the [Open Broker API spec](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.12/spec.md), and use the readme file as a guide to learn more.\n\nWhen the resource controller receives a request to create a resource, it calls your OSB to validate the service type, product, plans, and regions availability.

For example, you might be responsible for managing several departments in your company that have different billing requirements.

They can create an IBM Cloud account and invite other users with an IBMid to their account.

Instead, they can reuse their normal login to their IdP to log in to IBM web offerings, including IBM Cloud. Connecting an external IdP with IBMid is called federation, and the technical underlying protocol is called SAML. Those users are often referenced as federated IBMid users. As IBMid is federating with multiple enterprise customers at the same time, one prerequisite of a successful federation is a unique email address for each IBMid user.\n\nIBM Cloud App ID users\n: Instances of the IBM Cloud App ID can also connect to an IdP. An App ID instance can connect to onlyone external IdP using SAML, and therefore a unique email address isn't required.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud account owners \n\nTo create an IBM Cloud account, you need an IBMid user that will be the IBM Cloud account owner.

The management of users and their access to resources in each account remains entirely separate even when the accounts are added and organized in an enterprise.\n\nSee [What is an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) for more information about enterprises.\n\nThe user list for each child account in an enterprise is accessible only to users in that child account. This means the users who are invited to the enterprise and the users who are invited to the accounts within the enterprise remain entirely separate. This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources. If you add a user to an enterprise account that contains a number of accounts, those users do not automatically have access to manage those accounts as far as user management, billing, and more.

Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.\n\nWhen compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:\n\n\n\n* Centralized account management: View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view. Your subscription credit is pooled and shared among accounts in the enterprise.\n* Top-down usage reporting: From your enterprise account, you can view usage of all accounts in your enterprise, which is organized by account group.\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch and learn \n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nYour IBM Cloud account is your home for collaboration in the cloud. As you scale up your workloads, you might find that you're managing multiple IBM Cloud accounts. For example, your company might have many teams, each with one or more of their own accounts for development, testing, and production environments. Or, you might isolate certain workloads in separate accounts to meet security or compliance guidelines. As the number of accounts grows, it can become more difficult to track resource usage and associated costs.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises offer a simpler way to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you can create a multi-tiered hierarchy of accounts by adding new or existing accounts and nesting them in account groups. How you structure your enterprise is up to you. For example, for a large organization, you might organize your accounts by geography, or by department. You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03749-3299-5633", "score": 19.813627, "text": "\nHowever, you can still import these accounts into your enterprise by converting them to Subscription accounts and then importing them. To convert an account, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule).\n\nEach enterprise supports only a single billing currency. All accounts must use the enterprise billing currency before you add them to the enterprise. Existing accounts that are imported into the enterprise no longer separately manage their billing. As a result, subscription credit can't be added to individual child accounts. Subscription credit must be added to the enterprise account, where it becomes part of the enterprise credit pool.\n\n\n\n Billing transition when importing accounts \n\nWhen you import an existing account to an enterprise, its billing and invoicing transitions to being managed by the enterprise account. This transition includes the following changes to the account.\n\n\n\n* For Subscription accounts that are added, the account type is changed to Pay-As-You-Go. This change reflects that the account does not have its own subscriptions, but it still has full access to production-ready, billable services.\n* Subscriptions and promotions from each account are moved to the enterprise account, where they become part of the credit pool. After the move, each subscription has the same remaining credit and term period, but the subscription is given a new unique ID.\n* Access to billing and payment information for future billing periods is restricted to users in the enterprise account. Users in a child account can't access billing and payment information, such as invoices, payments, or subscriptions, even if they previously had access in the account. To view or manage billing, users need to be invited to the enterprise account and given access to the Billing service in that account.\n* Usage is invoiced to the enterprise account for the entire month when the account was added. For example, if you add an account to the enterprise on 15 June, all of the usage for the month of June is reflected in the July invoice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shared credit pool \n\nThe enterprise credit pool consolidates credit from all accounts in the enterprise and shares it with the accounts.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3.

This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API. For more information about the phrase operator of the query API, see [Query operators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-operatorsphrase).\n\n\n\n\n\n A short query returns irrelevant results \n\nIt might be that your query contains too many stop words and not enough distinct terms to trigger a meaningful search. When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07046-1542-3607", "score": 14.749163, "text": "\nMost of the content that is returned in search results that you submit from the Improve and customize page originates from this one field.

For more information, see [Previewing the default query results](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-results).\n\nMore processing adds more fields. And more processing is applied automatically depending on the project type. When processes run on documents in a collection, extra fields are added to store information that is associated with the process. For example, when the built-in Entities enrichment is applied to a collection, it starts a process that adds fields with names that begin with enriched_{field_name}.entities to the documents in the collection.\n\n\n\n* For more information about the enrichments that are applied by default, see [Default project settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-project-defaults).\n\n\n\n\n\n How fields are handled \n\nFor most unstructured file types, the bulk of the content from the file is added to a field named text.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search. For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms.

It does so, using machine-learning Watson techniques that find signals in your content and questions. After training, Discovery then reorders the query results to display the most relevant results at the top.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

Select the database in which you want to create a table.\n3. Select the schema in which you want to create a table.\n4. Ensure that you are in the DB Objects > Tables tab.\n5. Click Create table.\n6. Type a name for the table.\nIf the name contains special characters, enclose it in double quotation marks. The dot character (\".\") is not supported.\nYou can select a name that has up to 128 characters. The name must begin with a letter or an underscore and can't contain embedded spaces. The name must be unique.\n7.

Select your column type.\nThe data type restricts the type of data that can be stored in a column. For example, preventing entry of alphanumeric characters into a numeric field.\nData types also help sort data correctly and play a role in optimizing storage. For all these reasons, it is important to pick the appropriate data type.\n3. Specify whether Not null is true or false.\nA column that allows NULL values also allows rows to be inserted with no value in that column. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value.\n4. Specify the default value to be used if no value is specified when a row is inserted.\n5.

CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00646-3898-5632", "score": 21.781174, "text": "\nFor example, when your webpage is first loaded, it calls the GET /todolist endpoint. The GET /todolist endpoint uses the postFind method to query the database for all documents (by using the index created after the todo database), and then orders the notes by timestamp, and returns them to the front end for display.\n\nFiltering by tag uses the same postFind method, but by using the second index, you create and delete notes by using the postDocument and deleteDocument methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIBM Cloudant allows rapid development of web applications, as its HTTP API is modeled by the [Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm-cloud/cloudant) and is easy to integrate with your own code. You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant). Don't forget. The [IBM Cloudant Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-connectingibm-cloudant-dashboard) is a great way to explore your databases, create and modify documents, and refine your index and querying skills.\n\nYou can find more best practice guidance in our [blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/11/21/Best-and-Worst-Practices.html) and [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant/getting-started.html).

Create some sample data that represents a book in a library as shown in the following example:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"BXP9G5ZQY9Q4EA13\",\n\"author\": \"Dickens\",\n\"title\": \"David Copperfield\",\n\"year\": 1840,\n\"pages\": 723,\n\"publisher\": \"Penguin\",\n\"url\": \"https://www.somurl.com/dc\"\n}\n3. Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3. A report that details the number of books that are published by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. It also has some powerful counting aggregations suitable for drill-down user interfaces.\n\nIBM Cloudant Search also powers type=text IBM Cloudant Query indexes, so a subset of its capabilities is surfaced by using the _find API.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00472-16393-17597", "score": 21.16656, "text": "\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to query a global index:\n\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\n\nSee the following example that uses the command line to query a global index:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl \"https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1\"\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostSearchOptions;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.SearchResult;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nPostSearchOptions searchOptions = new PostSearchOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"<db-name>\")\n.ddoc(\"<ddoc>\")\n.index(\"<index-name>\")\n.query(\":\")\n.includeDocs(true)\n.limit(1)\n.build();\n\nSearchResult response =\nservice.postSearch(searchOptions).execute()\n.getResult();\n\nSystem.out.println(response);\n\nimport { CloudantV1 } from '@ibm-cloud/cloudant';\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({});\n\nservice.postSearch({\ndb: '<db-name>',\nddoc: '<ddoc>',\nindex: '<index-name>',\nquery: ':',\nincludeDocs: true,\nlimit: 1", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-60601-62822", "score": 21.135118, "text": "\nWhen you create a secondary index, you choose whether its purpose is for per-partition or global scope.\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00539-7-1755", "score": 21.024532, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloudant Query FAQ \n\n[IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query) is an API for querying slices of data based on the values of a database's document attributes. It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00469-13046-15136", "score": 20.971407, "text": "\nYou might find that you\u2019re mainly hitting the Query limit, but you have plenty of headroom in Lookups. It might be possible to reduce the reliance on Queries through some remodeling of the data or perhaps doing more work client-side.\n\nThe corollary here though is that you can\u2019t assume that any third-party library or framework optimizes for cost ahead of convenience. Client-side frameworks that support multiple persistence layers by using plug-ins are unlikely to be aware of this situation, or might be incapable of making such tradeoffs.\n\nChecking for third-party library or framework compatibility before you commit to a particular tool is a good idea.\n\nIt is also worth understanding that the rates aren\u2019t directly equivalent to HTTP API endpoint calls. You must expect that, for example, a bulk update counts according to its constituent document writes.\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant documentation on [plans and pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public) on IBM public cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Logging helps you see what\u2019s going on \n\nIBM Cloudant\u2019s logs indicating each API call made, what was requested and how long it took to respond can be automatically spooled to LogDNA for analysis and reporting for IBM Cloud-based services. This data is useful for keeping an eye on request volumes, performance, and whether your application is exceeding the provisioned capacity for your IBM Cloudant service.\n\nYou can set up the logging service at no cost to get started. Paid-for plans allow data to be parsed, retained, and archived to Object Storage.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 20.896208, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01415-6473-8616", "score": 18.202818, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Billing for storage and pull traffic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_billing_traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can images from other registries be scanned? \n\nVulnerability Advisor scans images from IBM Cloud Container Registry only.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is a Vulnerability Advisor scan triggered? \n\nFor more information about how the scanning of an image is triggered, see [Vulnerable packages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index&interface=uipackages).\n\n\n\n\n\n Why doesn't a new image scan? \n\nIf you get the vulnerability report immediately after you add the image to the\n\nregistry, you might receive the following error:\n\nBXNVA0009E: <imagename> has not been scanned.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret.

But when it comes to enterprise workloads, use a private registry, such as the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Users can choose between the SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise solution.\n\nAn ERP system is used for demand-oriented business resource planning. It is used to control processes and to link departments and functional areas in a meaningful way. Individual modules include applications for accounting, sales, production, and marketing. More complex tasks in customer or supply chain management can also be done by ERP software. As the successor to the core product SAP ECC, SAP S/4HANA was presented as the intelligent ERP system of the new generation. Thanks to modern technologies, the Software as Service (SaaS) version is designed to help companies standardize processes and make the leap to digitalization.\n\nWhile previous SAP ERP solutions support the most common databases, SAP S/4HANA uses exclusively the SAP HANA in-memory database developed by SAP. This in-memory database offers users the greatest technical benefit and they benefit from increased performance. The \"S\" in S/4HANA stands for \"simple\", while the \"4\" refers to the generation sequence. Compared to the SAP core product SAP ECC, which is still used in most companies, SAP S/4HANA offers many innovative functions that revolutionize the system landscape from the ground up. As SAP plans to discontinue the mainstream maintenance of its existing ERP solutions by 2027, many SAP ECC users are already considering a migration to SAP HA SZ S/4HANA\n\n\n\n\n\n What is created \n\nThe scripts work in two phases.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-automate-s4hana-ha-terraform-ansible"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06846-7-1399", "score": 13.673917, "text": "\nCommon scripts \n\nSome stages run default scripts if they are not specified in the DevSecOps config YAML file.\n\nThese scripts are part of a commons library, which can be used as a source to copy code from and customize them for specific edge cases for adopters.

Every push destination added to your Event Notifications instance incurs the fee.\n\nThe consumption price is based on outbound digital messages. Every push notification that is sent by the IBM Cloud push service counts as one outbound digital message and is charged. For example, you send messages to two platforms (iOS and Android) and you create a subscription that has 100 phone numbers. The subscription topic received 1000 events during the month:\n\nDestination instances: 2\n\nConsumption:\n\nTotal Outbound Digital messages = (number of phone numbers) x (topic events)\n\nIn the example, the total outbound digital messages are:\n\n100 x 1000 = 100000 outbound digital messages\n\nYou are charged for messages that are successfully sent by the IBM Cloud push service to the push provider regardless of whether the message was successfully delivered to the local device. So vet your device list carefully to prevent unnecessary charges.\n\nYou can monitor your push usage by setting up a monitoring dashboard through the Actions menu in the Event Notifications dashboard. For more information, see [Monitor Event Notifications service metrics with IBM Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-monitoring).\n\n\n\n Push charges for pre-production destination \n\nThe IBM Cloud push service has two components to pricing: a destination instance fee and a consumption price.\n\nA pre-production destination instance fee is charged monthly. Every pre-production destination added to your Event Notifications instance incurs the fee.\n\nConsumption: Only 500 devices or 5000 outbound digital messages is permitted per pre-production destination. If either the number of devices or the number of outbound digital messages exceeds the permitted limit, the permitted number of devices is moved by additional 500 devices or by additional 5000 messages and charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-push"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07556-4066-5601", "score": 14.8485775, "text": "\n* Subscription name: name of the subscription.\n* Subscription description: add an optional description.\n\n\n\n* Under the Subscribe to a topic section, select a topic from the drop-down list and select a destination from the destination drop-down list.\n* Destination type: select type under Destination and click Add.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 6: Set up Event Notifications Firefox web SDK \n\nThe Firefox web SDK enables Firefox websites to receive push notifications.

However, if you add a client action to a node, then after evaluation, the service always returns to the client so that the result of the action call can be returned.

If present, then it knows not to request new input from the user, but instead execute the action, add its result into the message, and pass it back to the service. The new POST message request should include the message returned by the previous POST message response (namely, the context, input, intents, entities, and optionally the output section) and, instead of the JSON object that defines the programmatic call to make, it should include the result that was returned from the programmatic call.\n\nIn a child node that you jump to after this node, add the response to show the user:\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"text\": {\n\"values\": [\n\"It will be $my_forecast $date.literal in $location.literal.\"\n]\n}\n}", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-actions-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13360-5427-7398", "score": 16.26459, "text": "\nFor relatively simple grammars like those in the previous examples, the service can return a result with a low confidence score even when the response does not appear to match the grammar at all. This might seem surprising, but a response with a low confidence score can indicate the best match that the service could find for the given audio, even though the response is unlikely to match the grammar. If the response does not match the grammar, the confidence value of the results is typically low enough to indicate the unlikelihood that the grammar can generate the response.\n\nAlways consider the confidence score when evaluating whether a response satisfies a grammar. If you don't know what threshold to set for rejection of a result based on its confidence, use an initial value of 0.5. If you experience unexpectedly large rejection rates of correct results, decrease the confidence threshold; for instance, 0.1 can be a good option for some applications. If you experience large numbers of incorrect recognition results, increase the confidence threshold for your application.\n\nIn many cases, an empty result or a result with a very low confidence score is a valid response. It can indicate that the user did not understand the question or the available options. You can always recognize the user's audio response without the grammar, but you then run the risk of getting a result that is not valid for the grammar. Grammars provide more reliable results than n-grams, which always return a result for anything other than complete silence.\n\nKnowing that the result must be one of the valid phrases defined by a grammar is a powerful feature that can simplify an application's response handling. Generally speaking, the service can return results with high confidence only for utterances that are generated by a grammar.

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them.

If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

You can choose to customize the information that is injected in to the tokens by the service.

For more information about tokens and how they're used in App ID, see [Understanding tokens](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-tokens).\n\nBy customizing your token configuration, you can ensure that your security and user experience needs are met. However, should a token ever become compromised, a malicious user might have more information or time that can be used to affect your application. Be sure that you understand the security implications of the customizations that you want to make before you make them.\n\n\n\n Understanding custom claims mapping \n\nA claim is a statement that an entity makes about itself or on behalf of someone else. For example, if you signed into an application by using an identity provider, the provider would send the application a group of claims or statements about you to the app so that it can group with information that it already knows about you. This way, when you sign in, the app is set up with your information, in the way that you configured it.\n\n\n\n What types of claims can I define? \n\nThe claims that are provided by App ID fall into several categories that are differentiated by their level of customization.\n\nNormalized claims\n: In each identity token, there is a set of claims that is recognized by App ID as normalized. When available, the claims are mapped directly from your identity provider to the token by default. The claims can't be explicitly omitted but they can be overwritten in your token by custom claims. The claims include name, email, picture, and locale.\n\nRestricted claims\n: Restricted claims are those that have limited customization possibilities and cannot be overwritten by custom mappings.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region.

Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing.

This strategy includes workloads in both the private cloud and multiple external cloud environments, such as the public cloud or a cloud managed by a service provider. Most enterprises are also faced with the challenge of protecting an ever-increasing attack surface while simultaneously maintaining compliance with industry and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nTo protect this expanding attack surface, enterprises need continuous visibility into workloads from the start until the end of their lifecycle. Enterprises must maintain a \u201cfull-stack\u201d understanding of the workload vulnerabilities and configuration issues at the infrastructure, platform, and application level in the context of threats and compliance requirements. Enterprises need predictive analytics to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d to give a proactive view of their cyberrisk and compliance risk posture in this vast, new hybrid world.\n\nCaveonix RiskForesight\u2122 provides proactive workload protection from risks due to cyberthreats and regulatory compliance issues. It provides real-time visibility into what is running in an enterprise\u2019s hybrid cloud through native integration into cloud orchestration platforms. Combining such visibility with risk reduction models and enforcement actions that can be automated, RiskForesight quickly develops a prioritized list of actions to mitigate. RiskForesight is a multitenant-aware hybrid cloud workload protection platform that implements a proactive risk management framework. This framework can operate at multiple control planes: network, compute, security, and compliance, while the implementation of the framework at cloud scale is automated.\n\nThe platform is fully integrated into the VMware\u00ae technology stack from vCD, vRA, vCenter to NSX and many public clouds. The RiskForesight platform has three key modules: Detect, Predict, and Act, providing 360-degree visibility into hybrid cloud workloads in real time by natively integrating into hybrid cloud orchestration modules.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12447-1578-3681", "score": 17.602417, "text": "\nIf the IAM credentials secret was created by using an existing service ID in the account, only the API key is regenerated as part of a manual rotation.

When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n* What happens when I rotate my secret?\n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.\n\nFor more information about secret rotation, see [Rotating secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotation).\n* What happens when my secret expires?\n\nIn some secret types such as arbitrary or username_password, you can set the date and time when your secret expires. When the secret reaches its expiration date, it transitions to a Destroyed state. When the transition happens, the value that is associated with the secret is no longer recoverable. The transition to the Destroyed state can take up to a couple of minutes after the secret expires, or a lock that prevented expiration is removed.\n\nFor more information about how your information is protected, see [Securing your data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-mng-data).\n* What are differences between the Reader and SecretsReader roles?\n\nBoth the Reader and SecretsReader roles help you to assign read-only access to Secrets Manager resources.\n\n\n\n* As a reader, you can browse a high-level view of secrets in your instance.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}]}

In this case, you can choose to continue without selecting a role so that the new credential is created without an IAM Service role.

Credentials are service-specific and vary based on how each service defines the credentials they need to generate. A credential might contain a user name, password, host name, port, and a URL.\n\nHowever, while the contents of each credential is unique to the service that generates it, all services managed by IAM require that new credentials include an IAM Service access role. Some services might generate more data that requires parameters to be passed in. For example, a service might require you to input a language parameter to set the default language that is returned in the resource key that is generated.\n\nTo create a resource key, call the [Resource Controller API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controllercreate-resource-key) as shown in the following example:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Python\n* Go\n* Node", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13071-11839-12907", "score": 16.501442, "text": "\nIf the intention that the credential be used to grant, access to a subset of buckets and not the entire instance, this policy needs to be edited.

However, all users must have the correct level of access to see the details of a credential including the API key value. The access of the user must be equal to or greater than that of the service credential.

A service credential is a collection of important information that is needed to connect to an instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage. It gives a user an identifier for the instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage (that is, the Resource Instance ID), service and authorization endpoints, and a means of associating the subject with an API key (that is, Service ID).

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16636-0-1664", "score": 19.592596, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Integrating Presto with Apache Hudi using a Hudi connector \n\nYou can integrate Presto with Apache Hudi by using the Hudi connector.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 19.888796, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 14.373378, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate).

For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}]}

Open each task that you want to update and click Apply Type System Updates.\n\nIf you removed entity types or relation types from the type system, all occurrences of those types are highlighted in gray in the documents. These invalid types are ignored by the machine learning model. They do not prevent you from submitting and approving document sets.\n4. Provide details to the human annotators about what changed in the type system.\n5. Ask human annotators to update their documents to reflect the changes in the type system. For example, if you added new entity types or relation types, they must review their documents and annotate them appropriately.\n\n> Note: If the task contains completed documents, human annotators cannot alter those documents to assess type system changes until they are back in an editable state. To become editable, ask human annotators to submit the document sets so that you can reject them.\n\n\n\nRelated concepts:\n\n[Type systems](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-typesystemwks_typesystem)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Document set management", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-improve-ml"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16563-20012-20766", "score": 19.10717, "text": "\nFor example, you might want to take a snapshot before you retrain the model.

In addition, each new release will support running models that were trained on the version prior to that so that upgrading won't impact your runtime.

In this case, Watson Assistant automatically retrains your assistant to the Latest version. This automatic retraining is required to assure your ability to run your trained models in your next upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practices \n\nIt's recommended to use the Latest version in your production deployment of Watson Assistant for IBM Cloud Pak for Data. This is the default for newly-created assistants. During an upgrade, your settings don't automatically switch existing assistants to use the latest version. If prior to your upgrade you had selected Latest, your settings continue to use that version, now labeled as Previous. After you upgrade, it's recommended you choose Latest and run basic regression tests.\n\nIBM performs robust testing on a variety of data sets to minimize impacts on existing assistants. But given the nature of machine learning models and the nuance and subtlety of natural languages processing, you may find some discrepancies from version to version. If you find a major issue through your tests, you have the ability to switch your settings and use Previous to return to the prior behavior. In this event, we recommend you contact IBM and provide details of your test so that that IBM can support you in the steps to resolve the problem.\n\nIt's also recommended that you try the Beta version in one of your test systems after you upgrade. This gives you early visibility to changes that are likely to be delivered in a future version, and will reduce the probability of negative impacts to your production systems.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12348-1227-2514", "score": 13.788377, "text": "\n(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret)[![carousel thumbnail](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/secrets-manager//images/secure-manage-secrets-video-thumbnail.png)<br><br>Securely managing your cloud secrets with Secrets Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOp7aGyavnk)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-release-notes)17 April 2023 | Now available: new API and CLI versions\n\nThe new API, SDK, Terraform, and CLI versions offer more options to manage your Secrets Manager instance.

JSON representation of Secrets Manager secret\n\n\n\n1. The name, id, and description, and other common fields hold identifying information about a secret.

For most secret types, the secret_data object contains the actual value of your secret.\n\nWhen you use the Secrets Manager API to retrieve the value of a secret, the fields that you see in the secret_data object differ depending on the type of secret that you are inspecting. For example, the following truncated example shows how secret data is represented for an arbitrary secret.\n\n{\n\"name\": \"my-arbitrary-secret\",\n\"secret_type\": \"arbitrary\",\n...\n\"secret_data\": {\n\"payload\": \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\"\n}\n}\n\nIf you're working with IAM credentials, the secret data is listed alongside the other common fields that describe your secret.

How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done. What it needs, in the form of the secret here, is what we call \"DB configs.\" Again, this DB config is going to allow it to have the correct communication with the service by saying, this is who I am and this is what I came here to accomplish.\n\nBut now that we have our user credentials in our DB configs as examples of secrets, we realize the vulnerability that can be created here if these credentials were to fall into the wrong hands. And this is why it's so important to establish a centralized place to manage all these things as we build out more applications and microservices. As we have more of these, the problem becomes more complex. If it falls into the wrong hands, how is protected? How do we block it from getting to that point?

If you require additional local disks, you can also choose one of the bare metal flavors that are designed for [software-defined storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodessds) solutions, such as Portworx. Depending on the level of hardware isolation that you need, virtual worker nodes can be set up as shared or dedicated nodes, whereas bare metal machines are always set up as dedicated nodes. If you create a free classic cluster, your cluster is provisioned with the smallest virtual worker node flavor on shared infrastructure.\n\nVPC clusters can be provisioned as standard clusters on shared [virtual](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) worker nodes only, and must be created in one of the supported [multizone locations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zoneszones-vpc). Free VPC clusters are not supported.\n\nVPC clusters can be provisioned using virtual worker nodes on standard infrastructure or dedicated hosts. Free VPC clusters are not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I combine different flavors in a cluster? \n\nYes. To add different flavors to your cluster, you must [create another worker pool](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_pool_create).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05858-1723-3537", "score": 20.646402, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Intel Hyper-Threading Technology](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profilesvpc-intel-hyper-threading). \n Security Clusters on shared hardware run in an isolated environment in the public cloud. Clusters on dedicated hosts do not run in a shared environment, instead only your clusters are present on your hosts. Network access control lists protect the subnets that provide the floating IPs for your worker nodes. For more information, see the [VPC documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc). \n High availability The master includes three replicas for high availability. Further, if you create your cluster in a multizone metro, the master replicas are spread across zones and you can also spread your worker pools across zones. For more information, see [High availability for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha). \n Reservations Reservations aren't available for VPC. \n Cluster administration VPC clusters can't be reloaded or updated. Instead, use the [worker replace --update CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clicli_worker_replace) or [API operation](https://containers.cloud.ibm.com/global/swagger-global-api//beta/replaceWorker) to replace worker nodes that are outdated or in a troubled state. \n Cluster networking Unlike classic infrastructure, the worker nodes of your VPC cluster are attached to VPC subnets and assigned private IP addresses. The worker nodes are not connected to the public network, which instead is accessed through a public gateway, floating IP, or VPN gateway. For more information, see [Overview of VPC networking in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnetsvpc_basics).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06010-9037-11236", "score": 20.602188, "text": "\nShared nodes are usually less costly than dedicated nodes because the costs for the underlying hardware are shared among multiple customers. However, when you decide between shared and dedicated nodes, you might want to check with your legal department to discuss the level of infrastructure isolation and compliance that your app environment requires.\n\nSome classic worker node flavors are available for only one type of tenancy setup. For example, m3c VMs can be provisioned in a shared tenancy setup only.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does bandwidth allocation work for VPC Gen 2 worker nodes? \n\nNote that IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service doesn't support adjusting the bandwidth profile that is associated with the underlying VPC instance profile.\n\nWhen you provision a worker node on a VPC Gen 2 cluster, you get the default bandwidth allocation for that instance profile. For more information, see [Bandwidth profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bandwidth-allocation-profiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does storage work for VMs? \n\nEvery VM comes with an attached disk for storage of information that the VM needs to run, such as OS file system, container runtime, and the kubelet. Local storage on the worker node is for short-term processing only, and the storage disks are wiped when you delete, reload, replace, or update the worker node. For persistent storage solutions for your apps, see [Planning highly available persistent storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-plan). Additionally, classic and VPC infrastructure differ in the disk setup.\n\n\n\n* Classic VMs: Classic VMs have two attached disks. The primary storage disk has 25 GB for the OS file system, and the auxiliary storage disk has 100 GB for data such as the container runtime and the kubelet. For reliability, the primary and auxiliary storage volumes are local disks instead of storage area networking (SAN). Reliability benefits include higher throughput when serializing bytes to the local disk and reduced file system degradation due to network failures. The auxiliary disk is encrypted by default.\n* VPC compute VMs: VPC VMs have one primary disk that is a block storage volume that is attached via the network.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes"}]}

Configure your workspace and target: When you choose one of the provided templates, you must select the target where you want to install the template. Depending on the template that you choose, the target can be an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster, a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster, or a classic or Virtual Servers for VPC. Because Schematics is used to install the software, you must configure the workspace that is automatically created for you.\n3. Run the template: When you run the template, Schematics uses the built-in Terraform, Ansible, Helm, OpenShift Operator, or Cloud Pak capabilities to install your software or spin up infrastructure resources. You can use your workspace to monitor the progress of your template execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\n\n\n* Explore blueprint samples by using Schematics [tutorials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-provisioning-terraform-template).\n* Click [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-how-it-works) to revisit the Schematics use cases.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-how-it-works"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11998-4-1884", "score": 18.076698, "text": "\nSchematics Blueprints is a [beta feature](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations) that are available for evaluation and testing purposes.

Where a blueprint defines the architecture, layout, major building blocks and customizations to be applied.\n\nThis building analogy also applies to reuse across environments. A builder may build an entire street of houses from the same blueprint drawing. Each house customized by its choice of color, lighting and styling, but all built to the same design.\n\nBlueprint template reuse supports a number of use cases:\n\n\n\n* Sharing an approved architecture across teams within a business\n* Deploying instances across multiple regions to create a highly resilient application deployment\n* Software delivery pipelines, dev, stage, prod\n\n\n\n\n\n Reuse across environments \n\nA blueprint template (house design) is reusable across environments, using a separately maintained [input configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-termsbpi1) to define the customizations for the target environment and usage.

For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a snapshot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore).\n\nFor best performance, you can enable snapshots for fast restore. By using the fast restore feature, you can create a volume from a snapshot that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. For more information, see [Snapshots fast restore](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-aboutsnapshots_vpc_fast_restore).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I add tags to a volume? \n\nYes, you can add user tags and access management tags to your volumes. User tags are used by the backup service to automatically create backup snapshots of the volume. Access management tags help organize access to your Block Storage for VPC volumes.

For more information, see [About restoring from a backup snapshot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore).\n\n\n\n\n\n Am I charged for usage? \n\nYes. Cost for backups is calculated based on GB capacity that is stored per month, unless the duration is less than one month. The backup exists on the account until it reaches its retention period, or when you delete it manually, or when you reach the end of a billing cycle, whichever comes first.\n\nPricing of subsequent backups can also increase or decrease when you [increase source volume capacity](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-expanding-block-storage-volumes) or [adjust IOPS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-volume-iops) by specifying a different IOPS profile for the source volume. For example, expanding volume capacity increases costs. However, changing an IOPS profile from a 5-IOPS/GB tier to a 3-IOPS/GB tier decreases the monthly and hourly rate. Billing for an updated volume is automatically updated to add the prorated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle.

Because MZRs are not available across locations, you must wait for IBM to bring a location back online if it becomes unavailable. If underlying data services are compromised by the failure, you must also wait for IBM to restore those data services.\n\nIf a catastrophic failure occurs, IBM might not be able to recover data from database backups. In this case, you need to restore your data to return your service instance to its most recent state.

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14870-7-1912", "score": 14.821986, "text": "\nDeployment Journey Overview \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) allows you to establish your own virtual private cloud by defining a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

To achieve the same goal with Cloud Functions, you can run them across as many availability zones or regions as you like, without having to pay a penny of incremental costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Web apps \n\nGiven Cloud Functions\u2019s event-driven nature, it offers several benefits for user-facing applications, whereas the HTTP requests coming from the user\u2019s browser serve as the events. Cloud Functions applications use compute capacity and billed only when they are serving user requests. Idle standby or waiting mode is nonexistent. This feature makes Cloud Functions considerably less expensive when compared to traditional containers or Cloud Foundry applications. Both of those tools have idle time, waiting for inbound user requests, and you are billed for all that \u201csleeping\u201d time.\n\nFull web application can be built and run with Cloud Functions. Combining serverless APIs with static file hosting for site resources such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, means that you can build entirely serverless web applications. The simplicity of operating a hosted Cloud Functions environment is not having to operate anything at all. Since Cloud Functions is hosted on IBM Cloud, it is a great benefit when compared to standing up, and operating a Node.js Express or other traditional server runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n IoT \n\nInternet of Things scenarios are often inherently sensor-driven. For example, an action in Cloud Functions might be triggered if a need to react to a sensor that exceeds a specific temperature. IoT interactions are usually stateless with the potential of high load in major spontaneous events such as natural disasters, significant weather storms, or traffic jams. A need is created for an elastic system where normal workload might be small, but needs to scale quickly with predictable response time. So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11949-7378-9866", "score": 20.140167, "text": "\n: Sophisticated AI-driven knowledge search system at the customer site and data processing where the data resides, eliminating the need to move data to cloud.

Those systems go through slow enhancement cycles, which leads to stagnant patient service levels.\n\nTo improve patient service, the provider looked to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery to reduce IT expenses and accelerate development, all on a secure platform. The provider\u2019s high-use SaaS systems, which held both patient record systems and business report apps, needed updates frequently. Yet, the provider's developers were overwhelmed with administering the hardware, network, and even the Kubernetes stack on their own. The provider also wanted to counteract increasing labor costs and a decreasing budget.\n\nThey started by containerizing their SaaS systems and putting them in the cloud. From that first step, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the SaaS apps, they easily designed Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. They used IBM Cloud Pak for Data to provide the familiar analytics tools from their on-prem environment. Another factor for decreased staff costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the provider can focus on delivering better customer service.\n\nAccelerated development is a key win for the IT Exec.

The following sections include typical examples. For a more detailed discussion of Serverless architecture, example use cases, pros and cons discussion, and implementation best practices, read the excellent [Mike Roberts article on Martin Fowler's blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html).\n\n\n\n Microservices \n\nDespite their benefit, microservice-based solutions remain difficult to build by using mainstream cloud technologies, often requiring control of a complex toolchain, and separate build and operations pipelines. Small and agile teams waste too much time with infrastructural and operational complexities such as fault-tolerance, load balancing, auto scaling, and logging. These teams want a way to develop streamlined, value-added code with programming languages they already know, love, and that are best suited to solve particular problems.\n\nThe modular and inherently scalable nature of Cloud Functions makes it ideal for implementing granular pieces of logic in actions. Cloud Functions actions are independent of each other and can be implemented by using various different languages that are supported by Cloud Functions and access various backend systems. Each action can be independently deployed and managed, is scaled independently of other actions. Interconnectivity between actions is provided by Cloud Functions in the form of rules, sequences, and naming conventions. This type of environment bodes well for microservices based applications.\n\nAnother important argument in favor of Cloud Functions is the cost of a system in a disaster recovery configuration. Compare microservices with PaaS or CaaS verses using Cloud Functions by assuming that you have 10 microservices, which use containers or Cloud Foundry runtimes. This comparison equates to 10 continuously running and billable processes in a single availability zone, 20 when run across 2 availability zones, and 40 when run across two regions with two zones each. To achieve the same goal with Cloud Functions, you can run them across as many availability zones or regions as you like, without having to pay a penny of incremental costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Web apps \n\nGiven Cloud Functions\u2019s event-driven nature, it offers several benefits for user-facing applications, whereas the HTTP requests coming from the user\u2019s browser serve as the events.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11949-9311-11868", "score": 18.229675, "text": "\nIt also enabled the delivery of cloud-like quality control, such as image analysis, and data lake related services at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Establishing a service platform for point of sale (POS) or multi function printer (MFP) systems \n\nWhen providing platform-based management services and data services to store POS systems nationwide as well as MFP systems in corporate offices, it can be difficult to integrate with these customer systems.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan.

In subscription billing, you purchase a subscription for an amount of credit to spend during the subscription term, and usage is deducted from the subscription credit at a discounted rate. The Enterprise Savings Plan billing model is similar to subscription billing. You commit to spend a certain amount on IBM Cloud and receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount.\n\nThe account that you use to create the enterprise must be a [Subscription account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accountssubscription-account) or an account with the [Enterprise Savings Plan billing model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-committed-use). After the enterprise is created, you can add more accounts to the enterprise. If you add a Lite or trial account, the account is automatically upgraded to a Pay-As-You-Go account.\n\nSome Pay-As-You-Go accounts can't be directly imported into an enterprise, such as many Pay-As-You-Go accounts that are billed in United States dollars (USD). However, you can still import these accounts into your enterprise by converting them to Subscription accounts and then importing them. To convert an account, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule).\n\nEach enterprise supports only a single billing currency. All accounts must use the enterprise billing currency before you add them to the enterprise.

Data centers across multiple locations provide resilience in the case of a geographic failure and bring workloads closer to globally distributed users, which reduces latency and increases perceived performance. The IBM Cloud network enables users to link workloads hosted in secure private networks across data centers and locations.

In addition, Subscription accounts provide discounts for platform services and support and more consistent billing through subscriptions. You can also [set up spending notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending) to get notified when your account or a particular service reaches a specific spending threshold that you set.\n\nWhen you purchase a subscription, you commit to a minimum spending amount for a certain period of time and receive a discount on the overall cost. For example, if you commit to spend $1,000 a month for 6 months, you might get a 5% discount. For the duration of the subscription, you get $6,000 of usage but pay only $5,700 for it. The larger the subscription, the better the discount.\n\nLarge organizations and other users with large cloud workloads can benefit from the savings and predictable billing that are provided by subscriptions.

You are charged an hourly rate that is metered for only the time that that the worker node is provisioned.

If the same user returns to your site later in the month and chats with your assistant again, the web chat integration recognizes the user. And you are charged only once when the same anonymous user interacts with your assistant multiple times in a single month.\n\n\n\nIf an anonymous user logs in and later is identified as being the same person who submitted a request with a known ID, you are charged twice.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.

You can optionally include a message that summarizes the user's issue to be provided to the human agent. It is the responsibility of the external service to display a message that is shown to the user that explains that the conversation is being transferred.

The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options. When a user clicks one of the options, an associated user input value is sent to your assistant. How options are rendered can differ depending on where you deploy the dialog.

A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers.

Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}]}

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "score": 14.30505, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

You provide information about the subjects or tasks that your users need help with, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n* Actions skill : Offers a simple interface where anyone can build a conversational flow for your assistant to follow. The complex process of training data creation occurs behind the scenes automatically. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-addskill-add-actions-skill)\n* Dialog skill: Offers a set of editors that you use to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree. You use the graphical dialog editor to create a script of sorts for your assistant to read from when it interacts with your customers. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses.

Add your skill to an assistant, and then set up one or more integrations with which to deploy your skill. The assistant adds a layer of function to your skill that enables Watson Assistant to orchestrate and manage the flow of information for you. See [Assistants](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants).\n* Built-in integrations: Instead of going to the Deploy tab to deploy your workspace, you add your dialog skill to an assistant, and add integrations to the assistant through which the skill is made available to your users. You do not need to build a custom front-end application and manage the conversation state from one call to the next. However, you can still do so if you want to.

Previously, if you had a node with slots that allowed for digressions away, the anything_else root node was triggered before any of the slot level Not found conditions could be evaluated. The order of operations has been changed to address this behavior. Now, when a user digresses away from a node with slots, all the root nodes except the anything_else node are processed. Next, the slot level Not found conditions are evaluated. And, finally, the root level anything_else node is processed. To better understand the full order of operations for a node with slots, see [Slot usage tips](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slotsdialog-slots-node-level-handler).\n* Strings that begin with a number sign (#) in the context or output objects of a message are no longer treated as intent references.\n\nPreviously, these strings were treated as intents automatically. For example, if you specified a context variable, such as \"color\":\"FFFFFF\", then the hex color code (FFFFFF) would be treated as an intent. Your assistant would check whether an intent named FFFFFF was detected in the user's input, and if not, would replace FFFFFF with false.

This type of search occurs only when the individual dialog node is processed.\n\nThis approach is useful if you want to narrow down a user query before you trigger a search. For example, the dialog branch might collect information about the type of device the customer wants to buy. When you know the make and model, you can then send a model keyword in the query that is submitted to the search skill, and get better results.\n* Search skill only: If only a search skill is linked to an assistant, and no dialog skill is linked to the assistant, then a search query is sent to the Discovery service when any user input is received from one of the assistant's integration channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Test the search skill \n\nAfter you configure the search, you can send test queries to see the search results that get returned from Discovery by using the Try it out pane of the search skill.\n\nYou cannot test the full end-to-end user experience from the dialog skill's Try it out pane. The search skill is configured separately and attached to an assistant. The dialog skill has no way of knowing the details of the search, and therefore cannot show search results in its Try it out pane.\n\nTo test the full experience that customers will have when they ask questions that are either answered by the dialog or trigger a search, you must test it by using the API.\n\n\n\n1. From the IBM Cloud Pak for Data web client, go to the details page for the provisioned instance.\n2. Copy the URL from the \"Access information\" section of the page. You will specify this value as the {url}.\n3. Copy the bearer token also. You will need to pass the token when you make an API call.\n4.

From the Dialog page of your dialog skill, make sure that the last node in the dialog tree has an anything_else condition with a search skill response type.\n\nWhenever this node is processed, the search skill is triggered.\n2. Add a folder to the dialog. Position the folder before the first dialog node that you want to de-emphasize. Add the following condition to the folder:\n\nintents[0].confidence > 0.5\n\nThis condition is applied to all of the nodes in the folder.

To do so, you can add utterances that you want the assistant to send to the search skill immediately as test utterances in the dialog skill's Try it out pane. You can then select the Mark as irrevlant option within the Try it out pane to teach the dialog not to respond to this utterance or others like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Disabling search \n\nYou can disable the search skill from being triggered.\n\nYou might want to do so temporarily, while you are setting up the integration.

For example, IBM manages and automatically applies updates to your cluster master. For your worker nodes, IBM provides security and version updates, but you must apply the updates. You are also responsible for your workload applications and data. For more information, see [Your responsibilities while using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks).\n\n\n\n\n\n What if some part of the service fails to comply with a recommendation? \n\nFirst, check the explanation of the failure for any remediation steps.\n\nThen, determine whether the failure is acceptable according to your security requirements. For example, some recommendations might be more in-depth configuration requirements than your particular processes or standards require. Also, some recommendations are not scored, and don't impact the overall benchmark score.\n\nNext, decide whether the component falls within your responsibility. If so, you might need to change how you configure that component. For example, you might configure pod security policies for all your app deployments. For components that are not directly within your responsibility, assess whether you can use another IBM Cloud service to meet the recommendation.\n\n\n\n\n\n What else can I do to increase the security and compliance of my cluster? \n\nSee [Security for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Running the worker node CIS Kubernetes benchmark \n\nTo review the results of the CIS Kubernetes benchmark for Section 4: Worker node security configuration, you can run the test yourself. Because you own the worker nodes and are partially [responsible](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks) for their compliance, you might make configuration changes that you want to validate on your own.\n\nBefore you begin: [Log in to your account.

Then, researchers and data analysts from everywhere can download data sets and do their own analysis.\n\nDevelopers started by deploying their research-sharing SaaS apps in containers with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. They created clusters for a Development environment that allow worldwide Developers to collaboratively deploy app improvements quickly.\n\nSecurity first: The Development Exec chose bare metal to host the research clusters. With bare metal for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, the sensitive research workloads now have familiar isolation but within the flexibility of public cloud.

For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05723-3429-5611", "score": 22.780315, "text": "\nThus, they chose IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service because IBM simplifies infrastructure management.\n\n\n\n* Managing Kubernetes master, IaaS, and operational components, such as Ingress and storage\n* Monitoring health and recovery for worker nodes\n* Providing global compute, so Developers don\u2019t have to stand up infrastructure in worldwide regions where they need workloads and data to be located\n\n\n\nMoving compute workloads into the IBM Cloud isn't enough though.

Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

Exceeding this limit causes a [413 error](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).\n\nIBM Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem) model for data. If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00474-7885-8455", "score": 19.322746, "text": "\nSummary \n\nToday, we combined two IBM Cloud services to optimize cost and user experience: IBM Cloudant as a document store and query engine and Databases for Redis as a content cache.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00576-8941-10714", "score": 24.908142, "text": "\nThe maximum document size is 1 MB, but documents must be much smaller than that size, typically a few KB.\n\nFor more information, see the following blog posts:\n\n\n\n* [Optimal IBM Cloudant Indexing](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/05/10/Optimal-Cloudant-Indexing.html)\n* [Time-series Data Storage](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/04/08/Time-series-data-storage.html)\n* [Partitioned databases - data design](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/03/05/Partition-Databases-Data-Design.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Making the most of the primary index \n\nIBM Cloudant has a primary index on the document's _id attribute. This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted. The _replicator document records the current state of the replication process.

Event Streams data can be replicated between an Event Streams instance in one location (region) and another instance in a different location. However, the user is responsible for provisioning a remote Event Streams instance and managing the replication.\n\nWe suggest a tool like Kafka MirrorMaker to replicate data between clusters. For information about how to run MirrorMaker, see [Event Streams kafka-mirrormaker repository](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-samples/tree/master/kafka-mirrormaker).\n\nThe user is also responsible for the backup of message payload data. Although this data is replicated across multiple Kafka brokers within a cluster, which protects against the majority of failures, this replication does not cover a location-wide failure.\n\nTopic names are backed up by Event Streams, although it is recommended good practice for users to back up topic names and the configuration data for those topics.\n\nIf you have configured your Event Streams instance in a Multi-Zone Region, a regional disaster is very unlikely. However, we recommend that users do plan for such circumstances. If a user's instance is no longer available because of a disaster (and a remote DR instance is not already set up), the user should consider configuring a new instance in a new region and restoring their topics and data from backup if available.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-1323355-1325090", "score": 13.761724, "text": "\nSelect the \"standard\" plan and hit save.\n\nIn cases where the instance has been locked due to exceeding the maximum allowed size of a Lite instance it may be necessary to use the CLI.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support.

For example, you can now expect the same confidence score for the following two inputs: ik ben een kleine krijger? and ik ben een kleine krijger. In this example, the question mark (?) doesn't affect the confidence score.\n\nImproved enhanced intent detection\n: The exact match in enhanced intent detection now better handles small differences between training examples and runtime utterances when the differences do not change the meaning of a sentence.\n\nFor example, suppose in your training examples, covid-19 is in the covid intent and @doctortype_facilitytype around Palm Beach is in the find_provide_master intent. In this example, the @doctortype_facilitytype direct entity reference contains entity values, including hospital. At run time, covid19 is predicted as 100% confident for the covid intent, and hospital around palm beach is predicted as 100% confident for the find_provide_master intent.\n\nThis update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model.

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

However, information about the key (such as the metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an Active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a Soft deletion where the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data that is encrypted by the key.

This also increases the preparedness checking of a real DR simulation or switch-over by periodic scanning that all of the components of the DR solutions are in place and works as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery simulation \n\nDR simulation is a way to verify or audit the emergency runbooks and check the\n\nrecovery time objectives(RTO) andrecovery point objectives(RPO) provided by the solution by simulating as much as possible in the same conditions as a real emergency.\n\nThis means introducing disruptions on replication network connections before interrupting the communications among the sites, hence simulating the sudden loss of the primary site.\n\nYou can do this only if your data replication solution is resilient and not providing impact on the production, which continues on the primary site. If this is not the case, then look at the documentation for [plan and design for the worst conditions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-drworst-conditions).\n\nDR simulation deploys a duplicate of your production environment on the DR site that you can use to perform validation and checking.

If you require historical metrics for auditing purposes, backup the metrics regularly by querying the metrics from the service and storing them at a remote backup site.\n\n\n\n Manual recovery of the service \n\nIf a regional disaster occurs, the recovery time of the service depends on the recovery time for the region. To minimize the downtime of the service and impact to your business, you could implement a manual failover to switch to another region while the region is being restored. To reduce the time to get up and running in a new location, consider using access groups to manage permissions working with the service, and backup the monitoring metadata of each instance.

If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP.

Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet.

Many layers of technology can exist between the reporting and failing components. Networks, disks, and drivers are only a few of the components to consider when you are investigating problems.\n\nThe following questions help you to focus on where the problem occurs to isolate the problem layer:\n\n\n\n* Is the problem specific to one platform or operating system, or is it common across multiple platforms or operating systems?\n* Is the current environment and configuration supported?\n* Do all users have the problem?\n* (For multi-site installations.) Do all sites have the problem?\n\n\n\nIf one layer reports the problem, the problem does not necessarily originate in that layer. Part of identifying where a problem originates is understanding the environment in which it exists. Take some time to completely describe the problem environment, including the operating system and version, all corresponding software and versions, and hardware information. Confirm that you are running within an environment that is a supported configuration; many problems can be traced back to incompatible levels of software that are not intended to run together or have not been fully tested together.\n\n\n\n\n\n When does the problem occur? \n\nDevelop a detailed timeline of events leading up to a failure, especially for those cases that are one-time occurrences. You can most easily develop a timeline by working backward: Start at the time an error was reported (as precisely as possible, even down to the millisecond), and work backward through the available logs and information. Typically, you need to look only as far as the first suspicious event that you find in a diagnostic log.\n\nTo develop a detailed timeline of events, answer these questions:\n\n\n\n* Does the problem happen only at a certain time of day or night?\n* How often does the problem happen?\n* What sequence of events leads up to the time that the problem is reported?\n* Does the problem happen after an environment change, such as upgrading or installing software or hardware?\n\n\n\nResponding to these types of questions can give you a frame of reference in which to investigate the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n Under which conditions does the problem occur? \n\nKnowing which systems and applications are running at the time that a problem occurs is an important part of troubleshooting.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-troubleshooting"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09252-7-1984", "score": 9.5076, "text": "\nLayer 7 policy \n\nA Layer 7 (L7) policy is used to classify traffic by matching its L7 information with L7 rules, and then taking specific actions if those rules match.\n\n\n\n* A policy is applied to a front-end application port (protocol).\n* Multiple policies can be applied to the same protocol.\n\n\n\nSince multiple policies can be applied to a protocol, a priority is associated with each policy.\n\n\n\n* Policies with the lowest set priority are evaluated first.\n* If the rules associated with the policy do not match the traffic, the next lowest policy on the priority list is evaluated.\n\n\n\nIf the traffic does not match any of the policy rules, the traffic is redirected to a default pool, which is the pool that was configured when the basic load balancer was deployed.\n\nEach policy is associated with an action that runs when all rules in the policy match the traffic.\n\nThe actions can be:\n\n\n\n* Reject\n* Redirect to HTTPS\n* Redirect to URL\n* Redirect to pool\n\n\n\nPolicies set to reject are evaluated first.\n\nIf the action is set to REDIRECT_HTTPS, then the HTTP traffic redirects to the HTTPS listener port.

But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.\n\nGenerally, a type system that includes many entity types and relation types is open to more interpretation, thus inter-annotator agreement might be lower during the early phases of model development.

For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

These applications and tenants require isolation from each other for security, fault isolation, and avoiding overlapping IP addressing issues. The NSX logical switch creates logical broadcast domains or segments (VXLAN vWires) to which an application or tenant virtual machine can be logically wired. This feature allows for flexibility and speed of deployment while still providing all the characteristics of a physical network's broadcast domains (VLANs) without physical Layer 2 sprawl. Logical switches allow for thousands of tenant networks to be provisioned onto a single IBM Cloud private network (VLAN). A logical switch is distributed and can span arbitrarily large compute clusters, even across pods within the same data center. This distribution allows for virtual machine mobility within the data center without limitations of physical Layer 2 (VLAN) boundaries across pods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logical routers \n\nDynamic routing provides the necessary forwarding information between Layer 2 broadcast domains (VXLAN, vWires, Logical Switches). This routing decreases Layer 2 broadcast domains and improve network efficiency and scale. NSX extends this intelligence where the workloads reside for providing East-West routing functions.

The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

Similarly, you might want to display a form after the web chat closes (for example, a customer satisfaction survey). You can use the same approach for either situation.\n\nWhen the web chat is opened or closed, it fires an [event](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-events) that you can subscribe to.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16375-7-1735", "score": 18.097664, "text": "\nAdding the web chat to your mobile application \n\nIf you have a mobile application built on a mobile framework such as iOS, Android, or React Native, you can use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to communicate between your app and the Watson Assistant web chat.\n\nUsing WebViews with a JavaScript bridge is a common pattern with a similar implementation for all mobile frameworks.\n\n\n\n Including the web chat as a WebView \n\nYou can include the web chat interface as part of a page of your mobile app, or as a separate panel that your app opens. In either case, you must host an HTML page that includes the web chat embed script, and then include that page as a WebView in your app.\n\nIn the embed script, use the showLauncher option to hide the web chat launcher icon, and the openChatByDefault option to open the web chat automatically when the page loads. In most cases, you will also want to use the hideCloseButton option and use the native controls of your app to control how the web chat page or panel closes.

A Plan includes rate limit settings that can be applied to the Plan as a whole, or specified for each operation in an API. Through Products and Plans, you have greater control over what APIs your developers have access to. After you create a product, it must be staged. Staging a product moves it to an active state that enables you to call and test the APIs included within it. When a product is staged, it is not yet visible to any developers.\n\nTip: As well as using the method described in this task, you can also create a Product when you create an API. If you create an API by using the Developer Toolkit command line interface, a Product is automatically created for you. You can then change any of the Product settings by opening your new Product in the Products page of the API Designer.\n\nTo create a Product by using the API Designer, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. To open the API Designer user interface, open a command line and enter the following command:\n\n\n\napic edit\n\nThe API Designer opens in your default browser.\n\n\n\n2. In the navigation list of the API Designer, click Products. The Products tab opens.\n3. Click Add and then click New Product. The Add a new product window opens.\n4.

Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human.

You teach it about the types of things your customers want to know and do, and then design a script for the assistant to follow as it converses with your customers to help them accomplish their business goals.\n\n![Skills](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/skill-icon.png) An assistant routes your customer queries to a skill, which then provides the appropriate response. Dialog skills return responses that are authored by you to answer common questions, while search skills search for and return passages from existing self-service content to answer more complex inquiries.\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill can understand and address questions or requests that your customers typically need help with. You provide information about the subjects or tasks your users ask about, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n Dialog tree Graphical user interface \n\n You can use graphical tools to create a dialog for your assistant to read from when interacting with your users, a dialog that simulates a real conversation. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses. ![A sample dialog tree with example content](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/dialog-depiction.png) \n\n\n\nThe dialog skill itself is defined in text, but you can integrate it with Watson Speech to Text and Watson Text to Speech services that enable users to interact with your assistant verbally.\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16233-7-2298", "score": 17.385197, "text": "\nAbout Watson Assistant \n\nUse IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant to build your own branded live chatbot into any device, application, or channel.

It uses machine learning models that are custom-built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search integration with IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\nZoom\n\n![Flow diagram of the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/arch-detail.png)\n\nHow it works\n\nCustomers interact with the assistant through one or more of these channels:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-213826-215727", "score": 17.330158, "text": "\nFor details, see [Defining entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities) and search for Enabling system entities.\n* You can now view a history of conversations with users on the Improve page.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}]}

For example, you might need to migrate data from old instances to new instances or update the credentials that are used for your app if you delete the Cloud Foundry alias.

For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" vs. \"una\". In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"}]}
