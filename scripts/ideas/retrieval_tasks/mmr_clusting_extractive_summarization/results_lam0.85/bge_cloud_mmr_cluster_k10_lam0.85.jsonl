Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds.

The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request.

The service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events. If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number.

The irrelevance detection model helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore. This enhanced model helps your skill recognize irrelevant inputs earlier in the development process.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of the new algorithm, read the [Why Zero-Effort Irrelevance is Relevant](https://medium.com/ibm-watson/enhanced-offtopic-90b2dadf0ef1) blog post.\n\nThe new algorithm is enabled automatically for any English-language skills that you import or create.\n\nTo test the new detection mechanism in the Try it out pane, submit one or more utterances that have absolutely nothing to do with your training data. The new mechanism helps your skill to correctly recognize that the test utterances do not map to any of the intents defined in your training data, and classifies them as being Irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n How irrelevance detection works \n\nThe algorithmic models that help your assistant understand what your users say are built from two key pieces of information:\n\n\n\n* Subjects you want the assistant to address. For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03363-4-2165", "score": 0.6508384943008423, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

The per-minute price of all audio that you recognize in a month is reduced once you reach the threshold of one million minutes of audio for that month. The price does not depend on how long the service takes to process the audio.

Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.\n* Am I charged for all audio that I send, even audio that does not include speech?\n\nYes, all audio that you send to the service contributes to your cumulative minutes of audio. This includes silence and noisy audio that does not contain or otherwise contribute to speech recognition.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05166-7-1684", "score": 0.7303215265274048, "text": "\nRelease notes for Object Storage \n\nNews on the latest releases from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage provide the updates you need on all things related to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n 14 June 2023 \n\nNew location!\n: Buckets can now be created in a Regional (MZR) configuration in Madrid, Spain.

Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources.\n\nWith Subscription accounts, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period.

Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.\n\nWhen compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:\n\n\n\n* Centralized account management: View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view. Your subscription credit is pooled and shared among accounts in the enterprise.\n* Top-down usage reporting: From your enterprise account, you can view usage of all accounts in your enterprise, which is organized by account group.\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch and learn \n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nYour IBM Cloud account is your home for collaboration in the cloud. As you scale up your workloads, you might find that you're managing multiple IBM Cloud accounts. For example, your company might have many teams, each with one or more of their own accounts for development, testing, and production environments. Or, you might isolate certain workloads in separate accounts to meet security or compliance guidelines. As the number of accounts grows, it can become more difficult to track resource usage and associated costs.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises offer a simpler way to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you can create a multi-tiered hierarchy of accounts by adding new or existing accounts and nesting them in account groups. How you structure your enterprise is up to you. For example, for a large organization, you might organize your accounts by geography, or by department. You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12561-4-2339", "score": 0.7736512422561646, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n* API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Viewing usage in an enterprise \n\nYou can track resource and support costs from accounts in your IBM Cloud\u00ae enterprise by viewing their usage. The accounts and account groups that you can view usage for depend on your assigned access.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises enable you to centrally manage multiple IBM Cloud accounts. As an enterprise user, you can keep an eye on resource usage and the associated costs for any account in the enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) for more information.\n\n\n\n Required access for viewing enterprise usage \n\nIn an enterprise, access to usage information is controlled by the Enterprise service. To view usage information, users must be invited to the enterprise account and have the Usage Reports Viewer, Editor, or Administrator role on the Enterprise service. The Usage Reports Viewer role provides access only to viewing usage reports, while the Editor and Administrator roles enable additional enterprise management actions. In keeping with security best practices, assign the least amount of access that is needed for the user to complete their task. For more information, see [Enterprise actions and roles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management).\n\nYou can give users granular access so that they can view usage for a certain account or account group. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team. You can scope the access so that each enterprise user can see only the information that is needed to fulfill their job role.\n\n\n\n* Your financial officer needs to view usage for the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department, but they don't need to create accounts or account groups. Assign them the Usage Reports Viewer role for the enterprise.\n* Each department lead needs to view usage for their department, and they also need to create and manage accounts and account groups for their teams.

Your assistant can automatically help customers recover from many such situations, and you can configure how it responds.\n\n\n\n How error conditions are handled \n\nThere are several kinds of error situations your assistant might need to recover from:\n\n\n\n* Your assistant cannot understand your customer's request\n* Your customer does not provide a valid response to a question\n* Your customer asks to talk to a live agent\n\n\n\nYour assistant can detect error conditions and give customers the chance to correct them. In addition, the built-in Fallback action provides a way to automatically connect customers to a live agent if they need more help.\n\n\n\n When the assistant can't understand your customer's request \n\nWhen you build actions, you train your assistant on what your customers might ask for. The Customer starts with section of each action provides examples of customer input that trigger the action; the assistant uses natural language processing to recognize customer input that is similar to these examples. This happens at the beginning of the conversation, or after any action has completed and the assistant is ready for another action.\n\nBut you can't anticipate every possible request, so sometimes customers will send input that your assistant can't match to any action. This might happen because the input isn't phrased in a way that the assistant can understand; it can also happen if customers ask for things that your assistant isn't designed to handle.\n\nUnrecognized input of this sort triggers the built-in No action matches action. To see how this action works, click Set by assistant in the list of actions, and then click No action matches.\n\nZoom\n\n![No action matches built-in action](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/no-action-matches.png)\n\nNo action matches built-in action\n\nBy default, this action has two steps, each step conditioned on the No action matches count session variable.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-handle-errors"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03282-4605-6541", "score": 0.7164719104766846, "text": "\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks.

(Simon is a developer on the Watson Assistant team.)\n* Dealing with ambiguous intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish that is ambiguous enough that your assistant finds two or more nodes with intents that could potentially address it. How does the dialog know which dialog branch to follow? If you enable disambiguation, it can show users their options and ask the user to pick the correct one. See [Disambiguation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity. But, using @appliance:(air conditioner) gets expanded to entity['appliance'].contains('air conditioner'), which matches whenever there is at least one @appliance entity of value 'air conditioner' detected in the user input.\n* Hiding data from the log: You can prevent information from being stored in Watson logs by storing it in a context variable and nesting the context variable within the $private section of the message context.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search. For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents.

You can use a json or text type of index with IBM Cloudant.\n\nIn the following cases, you can specify how the index is created by making it of type json:\n\n\n\n* You know exactly what data you want to look for.\n* You want to keep storage and processing requirements to a minimum.\n\n\n\nBut for maximum flexibility when you search for data, you typically create an index of type text. Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to /$DATABASE/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body. The type field of the JSON object must be set to json. A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST /$DATABASE/_index HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 0.7751277089118958, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-365807-367808", "score": 0.6880351305007935, "text": "\nThe images that are not eligible are still displayed, but they do not count toward the total number of images that is set in the retention policy and are not removed.\n* What regions are available?\n\n What regions are available? \n\nTo find out about the regions that are available for IBM Cloud Container Registry, see [Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_regions).\n* How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost?\n\n How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost? \n\nThe cost of Vulnerability Advisor is built into the pricing for IBM Cloud Container Registry.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry. Then, [install the open source Portieris project](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) admission controller to block container deployments from unsigned images.\n3. Regularly scan running containers:. Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Depending on the app, to add extra security, you can establish a job that takes down vulnerable containers after they are detected.\n\n\n\nYou can use the built-in container registry to automate the container image build process from your source code in an external source repository to your internal registry. However, images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the internal registry. To set up image scanning, set up a registry namespace and push your images to the managed IBM Cloud Container Registry instead.\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01415-6473-8616", "score": 0.7065043449401855, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Billing for storage and pull traffic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_billing_traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can images from other registries be scanned? \n\nVulnerability Advisor scans images from IBM Cloud Container Registry only.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is a Vulnerability Advisor scan triggered? \n\nFor more information about how the scanning of an image is triggered, see [Vulnerable packages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index&interface=uipackages).\n\n\n\n\n\n Why doesn't a new image scan? \n\nIf you get the vulnerability report immediately after you add the image to the\n\nregistry, you might receive the following error:\n\nBXNVA0009E: <imagename> has not been scanned.

Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01390-0-434", "score": 0.8123842477798462, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Managing security and compliance for Container Registry \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry is integrated with the Security and Compliance Center to help you manage security and compliance for your organization.\n\nFor more information about managing security and compliance, see [Getting started with Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-manage-security-compliance"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01447-7-2032", "score": 0.8116118907928467, "text": "\nAbout Container Registry \n\nUse IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry to store and access private container images in a highly available and scalable architecture.\n\nIBM Cloud Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image\n\nregistrythat is hosted and managed by IBM.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift overview \n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform is a platform that is designed to orchestrate containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

This offering uses open source, Terraform-based automation to provision and configure IBM Cloud VPC resources that make up the cluster. It deploys the worker nodes in all three zones for the region that you select. With simple steps to define configuration properties and use automated deployment, you can build your own HPC cluster in minutes. In addition, the automation deploys an extra virtual server instance (shown as the Login Node in the architecture diagram) so you can easily build and assemble applications for your cluster right away.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift for HPC enables three interfaces: UI, API, and CLI. The UI involves use of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation. Any updates that are needed post-deployment regarding Red Hat OpenShift configuration or setup should be performed by using Red Hat OpenShift tools and commands. If you use the Schematics interface to make changes to configuration properties and reapply those changes, you can cause disruptions to the running Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

Provisioning scripts can be any file that the operating system can run, including combined binary files or any OS-supported language. You have no restrictions for the script name; however, using a similar naming convention for each script makes it easier to identify. Provisioning scripts must be associated with a fully qualified domain name and accessible using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. The type of protocol that is used impacts the system's automated response when the provisioning script is downloaded to the device.\n\n\n\n* Using HTTP protocol requires an administrator to run the script manually after it is downloaded.\n* Using HTTPS protocol downloads and runs the script automatically, if possible.

During the ordering process, you can manually enter scripts for new accounts or scripts that are not yet tracked.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a cloud-init enabled image and provide user data to automatically perform configuration tasks or run scripts. For more information, see [Provisioning with a cloud-init enabled image](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/image-templates?topic=image-templates-provisioning-with-a-cloud-init-enabled-image).\n\nDuring the provisioning process, scripts that are associated with an HTTP URL are downloaded to the device. After provisioning, an administrator must run the script manually on the device. Scripts that are associated with an HTTPS URL are downloaded and run automatically. Provisioning scripts are currently available on only Linux operating systems (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Debian, or Ubuntu), and Windows and FreeBSD.

Similar to other use cases, all considerations for scalability, and other Qualities of Services apply.\n\nSee the following example that includes a discussion of [using Serverless as an API backend](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.htmlACoupleOfExamples).\n\n\n\n\n\n Mobile back end \n\nMany mobile applications require server-side logic. However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills. Since mobile applications often have unpredictable load patterns, you want to use a Cloud Functions solution like IBM Cloud\u00ae. This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications.

To limit the VPN traffic to only my-secure-namespace, you can create Calico global network policies.\n\nBefore you use this solution, review the following considerations and limitations.\n\n\n\n* You don't need to deploy the strongSwan Helm chart into the specified namespace. The strongSwan VPN pod and the routes daemon set can be deployed into kube-system or any other namespace. If the strongSwan VPN is not deployed into the specified namespace, then the vpn-strongswan-ping-remote-ip-1 Helm test fails. This failure is expected and acceptable. The test pings the remote.privateIPtoPing private IP address of the on-premises VPN gateway from a pod which is not in the namespace that has direct access to the remote subnet. However, the VPN pod is still able to forward traffic to pods in the namespaces that do have routes to the remote subnet, and traffic can still flow correctly. The VPN state is still ESTABLISHED and pods in the specified namespace can connect over the VPN.\n* The Calico global network policies in the following steps don't prevent Kubernetes pods that use host networking from sending and receiving data over the VPN. When a pod is configured with host networking, the app running in the pod can listen on the network interfaces of the worker node that it is on. These host networking pods can exist in any namespace. To determine which pods have host networking, run oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide and look for any pods that don't have a 172.30.0.0/16 pod IP address. If you want to prevent host networking pods from sending and receiving data over the VPN, you can set the following options in your values.yaml deployment file: local.subnet: 172.30.0.0/16 and enablePodSNAT: false. These configuration settings expose all the Kubernetes pods over the VPN connection to the remote network.

When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00644-18756-19998", "score": 0.693142294883728, "text": "\nGET $SERVICE_URL/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_view/$VIEW_NAME?start_key=\"alpha\"&end_key=\"beta\" HTTP/1.1\n\nSee the example of a global query that includes start_key and end_key query arguments.\n\nClient libraries use POST method instead of GET because they have the same behavior.\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl -X GET \"$SERVICE_URL/users/_design/allusers/_view/getVerifiedEmails?start_key=\"alpha\"&end_key=\"beta\"\"\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostViewOptions;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.ViewResult;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nPostViewOptions viewOptions = new PostViewOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"users\")\n.ddoc(\"allusers\")\n.view(\"getVerifiedEmails\")\n.startKey(\"alpha\")\n.endKey(\"beta\")\n.build();\n\nViewResult response =\nservice.postView(viewOptions).execute()\n.getResult();\n\nSystem.out.println(response);\n\nconst { CloudantV1 } = require('@ibm-cloud/cloudant');\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({});\n\nservice.postView({\ndb: 'users',\nddoc: 'allusers',\nview: 'getVerifiedEmails',\nstartKey: 'alpha',\nendKey: 'beta'\n}).then(response => {\nconsole.log(response.result);\n});\n\nfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1\n\nservice = CloudantV1.new_instance()", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-views"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02457-2791-4729", "score": 0.6911990642547607, "text": "\nYou can define query parameters to refine the events that you want to export.\n\nThe following table lists the query parameters that you can set:\n\n\n\nQuery parameters\n\n Query parameter Type Status Description \n\n from int32 Required Start time.

For more information about tokens and how they're used in App ID, see [Understanding tokens](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-tokens).\n\nBy customizing your token configuration, you can ensure that your security and user experience needs are met.

Be sure that you understand the security implications of the customizations that you want to make before you make them.\n\n\n\n Understanding custom claims mapping \n\nA claim is a statement that an entity makes about itself or on behalf of someone else. For example, if you signed into an application by using an identity provider, the provider would send the application a group of claims or statements about you to the app so that it can group with information that it already knows about you. This way, when you sign in, the app is set up with your information, in the way that you configured it.\n\n\n\n What types of claims can I define? \n\nThe claims that are provided by App ID fall into several categories that are differentiated by their level of customization.\n\nNormalized claims\n: In each identity token, there is a set of claims that is recognized by App ID as normalized. When available, the claims are mapped directly from your identity provider to the token by default. The claims can't be explicitly omitted but they can be overwritten in your token by custom claims. The claims include name, email, picture, and locale.\n\nRestricted claims\n: Restricted claims are those that have limited customization possibilities and cannot be overwritten by custom mappings.

For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06004-15614-17542", "score": 0.6582822799682617, "text": "\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step.

Sometimes, for example during a security audit, you might want to prevent someone on your team from accidentally deleting a secret. Or, if you plan to rotate your secrets regularly, you might be looking for a way to safely deploy the newest version of a secret after a rotation takes place. With locks, you can build automated workflows that help you to:\n\n\n\n* Indicate that a secret is in use by one or more applications or services.\n* Prevent secret data from being deleted even after a secret expires.\n* Safely delete older versions of secrets after the newest version is fully deployed to your applications.\n* Avoid inadvertent downtime in your applications.\n\n\n\nTo learn about the suggested guidelines for using locks to avoid application downtime, check out [Best practices for rotating and locking secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-rotate-secretsbest-practices-lock-secrets).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you begin, be sure that you have the required level of access.

A service credential is a collection of important information that is needed to connect to an instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage. It gives a user an identifier for the instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage (that is, the Resource Instance ID), service and authorization endpoints, and a means of associating the subject with an API key (that is, Service ID).

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13481-1627-2985", "score": 0.7302296161651611, "text": "\nDisplay your tables and run an SQL statement:\n\nspark.sql('show tables').show(truncate=False)\n\n replace yourTable with a valid table.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.7063522934913635, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6511025428771973, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04175-0-1274", "score": 0.6444553732872009, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04666-14564-15396", "score": 0.6507148742675781, "text": "\nYour privacy choices\n\n![0_ti_146001191_Ver_2_mid_91628333-84d7-4531-b8f2-721f8124ac01_sid_cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542_vid_cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d_vids_0_msclkid_N_pi_918639831_lg_en-US_sw_3840_sh_2160_sc_30_nwd_1_tl_HTTP_20headers_20_7C_20IBM_20Cloud_20Docs_p_https_3A_2F_2Fcloud.ibm.com_2Fdocs_2Fcloud-foundry-public_3Ftopic_3Dcloud-foundry-public-http-headers_r_lt_796_evt_pageLoad_sv_1_rn_196001](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=146001191&Ver=2&mid=91628333-84d7-4531-b8f2-721f8124ac01&sid=cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542&vid=cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d&vids=0&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=3840&sh=2160&sc=30&nwd=1&tl=HTTP%20headers%20%7C%20IBM%20Cloud%20Docs&p=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.ibm.com%2Fdocs%2Fcloud-foundry-public%3Ftopic%3Dcloud-foundry-public-http-headers&r=&lt=796&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&rn=196001)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-http-headers"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.6506773829460144, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03109-10370-12635", "score": 0.6265141367912292, "text": "\nWhen the web chat widget is being interacted with by a user, we track the features that are being used, and events such as how many times the widget is opened and how many users start conversations.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

Therefore, although you cannot hide a node from Intercom, you can configure the assistant to do nothing when the node is triggered.\n\nFill in the following fields of the root node of each dialog branch:\n\n\n\n* Node name: Give the node a name. This name is how you will identify the node when you configure interactions for it later. If you don't add a name, you will have to choose the node based on its node ID instead.\n* External node name: Add a summary of the purpose of the dialog branch. For example, Find a store.\n\nThis information is shown to other agents on the assistant's team when the assistant offers to answer a user query. If there is more than one dialog node that can address the query, the assistant shares a list of response options with human agent teammates to get their advice about which response to use.\n\n![Screenshot of the field in the node edit view where you add the node purpose summary.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/disambig-node-purpose.png)\n\nDo not add an external node name to the root node that you created in Step 2.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-intercom"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-4614-6320", "score": 0.7285595536231995, "text": "\n* Wait for user input: Your assistant pauses until new input is provided by the user.\n* Skip user input: Your assistant jumps directly to the first child node.

See [Defining what to do next](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-jump-to).\n* Before you enable digressions away from a node, test the most common user scenarios.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03329-3417-4930", "score": 0.7184298634529114, "text": "\nYou successfully started to build your training data by adding prebuilt content from IBM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Build a dialog \n\nA [dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response. Changing one line of text can prevent you from having to write multiple lines of code to implement a complex programmatic solution.\n* Back up your skill frequently.

After defining the intent, you can add a root-level dialog node that conditions on the intent. As the dialog node response, add a Connect to human agent response type. At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person. Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request. Instead of asking the customer to retry or rephrase the question over and over, your assistant can offer to transfer the customer to a human agent.\n\n\n\nTo design a dialog that can transfer the conversation, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2.

These worker nodes virtual machines and all the worker node components are dedicated to you only and are not shared with other IBM customers. However, the underlying hardware is shared with other IBM customers. For more information, see [Virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm). You manage the worker nodes through the automation tools that are provided by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, such as the API, CLI, or console. Unlike classic clusters, you don't see VPC compute worker nodes in your infrastructure portal or separate infrastructure bill, but instead manage all maintenance and billing activity for the worker nodes from IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Worker nodes include the same [components](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-archworker-components) as described in the Classic architecture. Community Kubernetes worker nodes run on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64, 16.04 x86_64 (deprecated). \n Cluster networking Your worker nodes are created in a VPC subnet in the zone that you specify. By default, the public and private cloud service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPC VPN on the private network. \n App networking You can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes.

To ensure that every virtual machine can run independently, a virtual machine monitor, also referred to as the hypervisor, segments the physical resources into isolated entities and allocates them as dedicated resources to a virtual machine (hypervisor isolation).\n* In a single-tenant, dedicated hardware setup: All physical resources are dedicated to you only. You can deploy multiple worker nodes as virtual machines on the same physical host. Similar to the multi-tenant setup, the hypervisor assures that every worker node gets its share of the available physical resources.\n\n\n\nShared nodes are usually less costly than dedicated nodes because the costs for the underlying hardware are shared among multiple customers.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template. Review available service plans and pricing information for each resource that you are about to create. Some services come with a limit per IBM Cloud account.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-general-faq"}]}

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb/vpc/images/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-887513-889443", "score": 0.6939823627471924, "text": "\nCan I port them to the VPC?\n\n I have volumes on the Classic infrastructure.

Then, you can use the custom image to provision other virtual server instances. For more information, see [About creating an image from a volume](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpc).\n* How is the boot disk created for an instance and how does it relate to the virtual machine image?\n\n How is the boot disk created for an instance and how does it relate to the virtual machine image? \n\nThe boot disk, also called a boot volume, is created when you provision a virtual server instance. The boot disk of an instance is a cloned image of the virtual machine image. For stock images, the boot volume capacity is 100 GB. If you are importing a custom image, the boot volume capacity can be 10 GB to 250 GB, depending on what the image requires. Images smaller than 10 GB are rounded up to 10 GB. The boot volume is deleted when you delete the instance to which it is attached.\n* When can I delete a Block Storage for VPC data volume?\n\n When can I delete a Block Storage for VPC data volume? \n\nYou can delete a Block Storage for VPC data volume only when it isn't attached to a virtual server instance. [Detach the volume](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storagedetach) before you delete it. Boot volumes are detached and deleted when the instance is deleted.\n* What happens to my data when I delete a Block Storage for VPC data volume?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs"}]}

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16080-1378-3052", "score": 0.7779158353805542, "text": "\nIn short, using VPC you can:\n\n\n\n* create a software-defined network (SDN),\n* isolate workloads,\n* have fine control of inbound and outbound traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\n Objectives \n\n\n\n* Understand the infrastructure objects available for virtual private clouds\n* Learn how to create a virtual private cloud, subnets and server instances\n* Know how to apply security groups to secure access to the servers\n\n\n\nZoom\n\n![Architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb/vpc/includes/solution-tutorials/includes/solution-tutorials/images/solution40-vpc-public-app-private-backend/Architecture.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

Specifically, [vpc network load balancer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-vs-elb), [virtual server instances](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsi_best_practices), [security groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-security-groups), [network ACLs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-acls) and [public gateways](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpcexternal-connectivity).\n\nThis tutorial may incur costs. Use the [Cost Estimator](https://cloud.ibm.com/estimator/review) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.\n\nHosting web applications is a common deployment pattern for public cloud, where resources can be scaled on demand to meet short term and long term usage demands. Security for the application workloads is a fundamental prerequisite, to complement the resilience and scalability afforded by public cloud.\n\nThis tutorial takes you through the creation of a scalable and secure Internet facing web application hosted in private network secured using a virtual router appliance (VRA), VLANs, NAT and firewalls.

To achieve the same goal with Cloud Functions, you can run them across as many availability zones or regions as you like, without having to pay a penny of incremental costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Web apps \n\nGiven Cloud Functions\u2019s event-driven nature, it offers several benefits for user-facing applications, whereas the HTTP requests coming from the user\u2019s browser serve as the events. Cloud Functions applications use compute capacity and billed only when they are serving user requests. Idle standby or waiting mode is nonexistent. This feature makes Cloud Functions considerably less expensive when compared to traditional containers or Cloud Foundry applications. Both of those tools have idle time, waiting for inbound user requests, and you are billed for all that \u201csleeping\u201d time.\n\nFull web application can be built and run with Cloud Functions. Combining serverless APIs with static file hosting for site resources such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, means that you can build entirely serverless web applications. The simplicity of operating a hosted Cloud Functions environment is not having to operate anything at all. Since Cloud Functions is hosted on IBM Cloud, it is a great benefit when compared to standing up, and operating a Node.js Express or other traditional server runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n IoT \n\nInternet of Things scenarios are often inherently sensor-driven. For example, an action in Cloud Functions might be triggered if a need to react to a sensor that exceeds a specific temperature. IoT interactions are usually stateless with the potential of high load in major spontaneous events such as natural disasters, significant weather storms, or traffic jams. A need is created for an elastic system where normal workload might be small, but needs to scale quickly with predictable response time. So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}]}

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03771-1594-3365", "score": 0.6628905534744263, "text": "\nThe charges on your invoice are consistent with the usage dashboard.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03735-1425-3233", "score": 0.6851252317428589, "text": "\nEnter your estimated usage, and click Calculate Cost.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-1068047-1069909", "score": 0.6620926856994629, "text": "\nIf you manage your invoices through the IBM Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking Manage > Billing and usage, and selecting Invoices.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

To set requirements for the strength of a user's password, you can use the following steps.\n\nTo set this configuration by using the GUI:\n\n\n\n1. Go to the Cloud Directory > Password policies tab of the App ID dashboard.\n2. In the Define password strength box, click Edit. A screen opens.\n3.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame. The maximum session inactivity time allowed ranges from 5 minutes to 7 days, depending on your plan type. If you do not add the dialog skill to an assistant, it is your responsibility as the custom application developer to maintain any continuing information that the application needs.\n\nThe application can pass information to the dialog, and the dialog can update this information and pass it back to the application, or to a subsequent node. The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03273-13172-14845", "score": 0.7076066732406616, "text": "\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03273-6798-8762", "score": 0.7494304776191711, "text": "\nOn the node you want to copy, click the More(images/search_dialog.png)More icon][!!] icon, and then select Duplicate.\n2.

For example, you might group nodes that address questions about user accounts in a User account folder and nodes that handle payment-related queries in a Payment folder.\n* To group together a set of nodes that you want the dialog to process only if a certain condition is met. Use a condition, such as $isPlatinumMember, for example, to group together nodes that offer extra services that should only be processed if the current user is entitled to receive the extra services.\n* To hide nodes from the runtime while you work on them. You can add the nodes to a folder with a false condition to prevent them from being processed.\n\n\n\nThese characteristics of the folder impact how the nodes in a folder are processed:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If no condition is specified, then your assistant processes the nodes within the folder directly.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasks"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-5948-7694", "score": 0.7491632699966431, "text": "\n[More icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/kebab.png) icon.\n\n\n\n* To create a peer node that is checked next if the condition for the existing node is not met, select Add node below.\n* To create a peer node that is checked before the condition for the existing node is checked, select Add node above.\n* To create a child node to the selected node, select Add child node.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02900-27485-29358", "score": 0.7454938888549805, "text": "\nfirst to ensure that the intents themselves are as unique as possible, which helps your assistant attain better intent confidence scores.Keep in mind:<-- <ul> --> * For nodes that condition on intents, if your assistant is confident that the node's intent condition matches the user's intent, then the node might be included as a disambiguation option. * For nodes with boolean conditions (conditions that evaluate to either true or false), the node might be included as a disambiguation option if the condition evaluates to true.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application. For example, if the source document contains the sentence Murder on the Orient Express made headlines, then how you define entity types to capture the key information in the sentence differs depending on the type of application that will use the model that you build with the type system.\n\n\n\n* For a literary application, you might create types that capture this information:\n\n[NOVEL] [CRITICAL_RECEPTION]\n\n[Murder on the Orient Express] [made headlines]\n* For a public safety application, you might create these types:\n\n[EVENT_CRIME] [LOCATION]\n\n[Murder] on the [Orient Express] made headlines\n\n\n\nThe structure is often driven by characteristics of the documents from which information will be extracted, but should always be tempered by what information the application will actually use from those documents. For example, you might be creating an application that gains insights from medical records. To build the type system, you start looking at patient records to see what kinds of information must be captured. The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system.

That is alright and even expected.\n\nMentions annotate a span of text; they do not replace the text. A type system is not an ontology for a domain.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

Your worker nodes, apps, and resources continue to run.\n\nCan I roll back the update?\n: No, you can't roll back a cluster to a previous version after the update process takes place. Be sure to use a test cluster and follow the instructions to address potential issues before you update your production master.\n\nWhat process can I follow to update the master?\n: The following diagram shows the process that you can take to update your master.\n\nZoom\n\n![Master update process diagram](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/4d497aff9e27b92fbbc2ee4e343a9ec4549cb1d7/containers//images/updating-master2.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

Wait for the etcd restoration to complete and the master state to return to deployed. \n updating The master is updating its Kubernetes version. The update might be a patch update that is automatically applied, or a minor or major version that you applied by updating the cluster. During the update, your highly available master can continue processing requests, and your app workloads and worker nodes continue to run. After the master update is complete, you can [update your worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-updateworker_node). If the update is unsuccessful, the master returns to a deployed state and continues running the previous version. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can check if the update failed in the Master Status field. \n update_cancelled The master update is canceled because the cluster was not in a healthy state at the time of the update. Your master remains in this state until your cluster is healthy and you manually update the master. To update the master, use the ibmcloud oc cluster master update[command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_cluster_update). If you don't want to update the master to the default major.minor version during the update, include the --version option and specify the latest patch version that is available for the major.minor version that you want, such as 1.26. To list available versions, run ibmcloud oc versions. \n update_failed The master update failed. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue.

The worker nodes correspond to the Kubernetes Node resource, and are managed by a Kubernetes master that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster. So when you deploy the resources for a containerized app, the Kubernetes master decides which worker node to deploy those resources on, accounting for the deployment requirements and available capacity in the cluster. Kubernetes resources include services, deployments, and pods. For more information, see [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n\nNamespace\n: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-roks-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05998-1617-3497", "score": 0.7561599016189575, "text": "\nThe open source project, Kubernetes, combines running a containerized infrastructure with production workloads, open source contributions, and Docker container management tools.

When you perform a rolling update, the deployment checks whether the update is working and stops the rollout when failures are detected.\n: A deployment is just one type of workload controller that you can use to manage pods. For help choosing among your options, see [What type of Kubernetes objects can I make for my app?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deployobject). For more information about deployments, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).\n\nPod\n: Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. Usually, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).\n\nApp\n: An app might refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You might deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate worker nodes.

The Heapster pod discovers all nodes in the cluster and queries usage information from each node's kubelet. You can find utilization graphs in the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nIngress ALB\n: Ingress is a Kubernetes service that you can use to balance network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to multiple apps in your cluster. To expose your apps over the public or private network, you must create an Ingress resource to register your apps with the Ingress application load balancer (ALB). Multiple apps can then be accessed by using a single URL or IP address.\n\nStorage provider\n: Every cluster is set up with a plug-in to provision file storage. You can choose to install other add-ons, such as block storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n ibm-system namespace \n\nLogging and metrics\n: You can use the IBM\u00ae Log Analysis and IBM Cloud\u00ae Monitoring services to expand your collection and retention capabilities when working with logs and metrics.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06480-1160-2754", "score": 0.7192420363426208, "text": "\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https://developer.ibm.com/depmodels/cloud/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/training/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/35-Connectivity.svg)](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/publiccloud/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06501-7-1686", "score": 0.7148670554161072, "text": "\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field.

Instead, indexing is scheduled to happen later, providing a faster, non-blocking write throughput.\n\n\n\n* MapReduce views are indexes into the data set with key value pairs that are stored in a BTree for efficient retrieval by key or range of keys.\n* Search Indexes are constructed by using Apache Lucene to allow free-text search, faceting, and complex ad hoc queries.\n\n\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae's [search indexes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search) and [MapReduce views](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-views-mapreduce) are configured by adding design documents to a database.

They are thin wrappers around the IBM Cloudant HTTP API - so it's worth understanding the underlying API to understand all the parameters.\n\nThe libraries handle two things for you, which is useful:\n\nAuthentication\n: Exchanging your keys for tokens, whether it be legacy authentication or IAM.\n\nRetry logic\n: The libraries can be configured to retry API calls that exceeded your provisioned capacity. If configured this way, they pause and reattempt the API call multiple times with exponential back-off.\n\nRetrying such API calls is sensible if you have a temporary and unexpected elevation in traffic.

You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant.

You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Pricing is based on the aggregate number of minutes of audio that you recognize per month:\n\n\n\n* Users who recognize 1 to 999,999 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.02 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n* Users who recognize at least 1,000,000 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.01 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n\n\n\nThe Plus plan is intended for small businesses. It is also a good choice for large enterprises that want to develop and test larger applications before considering moving to a Premium plan. For more information, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I continue to use the Speech to Text Standard plan? \n\nThe Standard plan is no longer available for purchase by new users. But existing users of the Standard plan can continue to use the plan indefinitely with no change in their pricing. Their API settings and custom models remain unaffected.\n\nExisting users can also choose to upgrade to the new Plus plan by visiting the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text). They will continue to have access to all of their settings and custom models after upgrading. And, if they find that the Plus plan does not meet their needs for any reason, they can always downgrade back to their Standard plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n What pricing plan do I need to use the service's customization interface? \n\nYou must have a paid plan (Plus, Standard, or Premium) to use language model or acoustic model customization. Users of the Lite plan cannot use customization. To use customization, users of the Lite plan must upgrade to a paid plan such as the Plus plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"}]}

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical.

However, if you close your account, any existing instances and keys are automatically hard deleted. Check out [Account cancelation and data deletion](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-complianceaccount-cancelation) for more information.\n\nIn the event that a key is no longer needed or should be removed, Key Protect allows you to delete and ultimately purge keys, an action that shreds the key material and makes any of the data encrypted with it inaccessible.\n\nDeleting a key moves it into a Destroyed state, a \"soft\" deletion in which the key can still be seen and restored for 30 days. After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame. After 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged.

Therefore, the version in cache is considered valid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: For event-driven content, purge your cache \n\nFor example, every time a new post is added to your blog, you could easily purge the CIS cache. It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https://www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com/\n* www.example.com/foo/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path. It can also simplify the number of purge calls made.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only) \n\nPurging by hostname is similar to purging by prefixes. Use a list of hostnames to purge the cache of any assets associated with those hostnames.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by tags (Enterprise only)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment-for-best-performance"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08211-1158-3123", "score": 0.6833430528640747, "text": "\nibmcloud hpvs instance-delete CRN --force\n\n\n\nWhere CRN is Cloud resource name of the server you want to delete.

The server is deleted after the reclamation period ends. During this seven-day reclamation period, you can restore the virtual server, or manually trigger a deletion from [resource reclamations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resourceibmcloud_resource_reclamations).

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) metrics for essential business functions. Implement your application so that the metrics are achieved.\n\nPurpose & value: Unfortunately, disasters occur that can make some or all of the data centers in a region unavailable. To avoid data loss, you must ensure all important data is backed up to a separate multizone region that can be used to restore service. However, your consumers must be able to opt out of having their data stored in the alternate region based on their data residency requirements.\n\nIn addition, you must follow best practices for BCDR as defined by the specific managed services that you use.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there. Activating the domain before migrating from CIS can cause your domain to changed to a [Moved state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status).\n\n\n\n\n\n I added a user to my account and gave that user permission to manage Internet Services instance(s). Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-faq"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14639-1516-2901", "score": 0.7619762420654297, "text": "\nEnsure that you do not have any NSX objects that are expanded into the secondary instance that you want to delete.\n3.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there. Activating the domain before migrating from CIS can cause your domain to changed to a [Moved state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status).\n\n\n\n\n\n I added a user to my account and gave that user permission to manage Internet Services instance(s). Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-faq"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04149-4598-6150", "score": 0.7424646615982056, "text": "\nIf you are unsure of who the registrar is for your domain, you can look it up at [whois.icann.org](https://whois.icann.org/).\n\nIf you delegate a subdomain (for instance, subdomain.example.com) from another DNS provider, you must replace the existing name server (NS) records and replace them with a name server record for each of the name servers that are provided by CIS.

You can submit a request to recheck name servers by clicking on Recheck name servers in the overview page.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who is the registrar for my domain? \n\nConsult [https://whois.icann.org/](https://whois.icann.org/) for this information.\n\nYou must have the administrator privilege to edit your domain's configuration at the registrar in order to update or add the name servers provided for your domain when you add it to CIS. If you don't know who the registrar is for the domain you're trying to add to CIS, it is unlikely you have the permission to update your domain's configuration at the registrar. Work with the owner of the domain in your organization to make the necessary changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n I want to keep my current DNS provider for my domain (example.com). Can I delegate a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) from my current DNS provider to CIS? \n\nYes. The process is similar to adding a domain, but instead of the registrar, you work with the DNS provider for the higher level domain. When you add a subdomain to CIS, you are given two name servers to configure, as usual. You configure a Name Server (NS) record for each of the two name servers as DNS records within your domain being managed by the other DNS provider. When we are able to verify that the required NS records have been added, we activate your subdomain. If you do not manage the higher level domain within your organization, you must work with the owner of the higher level domain to get the NS records added.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-faq"}]}

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13875-5421-6971", "score": 0.6306973099708557, "text": "\n[Zones](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/6a28e4ae2660b609a18e90e1239ed772f80373d6/transit-gateway/includes/solution-tutorials/includes/solution-tutorials/images/vpc-transit/vpc-transit-zones.svg)\n\nZones\n\nThis diagram shows the traffic flow.

IBM Cloud focuses on protection across the entirety of the compute lifecycle, which includes everything from the build process and key management to the security of data services. IBM Cloud also provides a group of security services that can be used by application developers to secure their mobile and web apps. These elements combine to make IBM Cloud a platform with clear choices for secure application development.\n\nIn addition to our own diligence in creating and operating a secure cloud, IBM\u00ae also engages many different firms to assess the security and compliance of our cloud platform. For more information, see [IBM Cloud compliance programs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance) for a detailed list of certifications and attestations.\n\nIBM Cloud ensures security readiness by adhering to security policies that are driven by best practices in IBM for systems, networking, and secure engineering. These policies include practices such as source code scanning, dynamic scanning, threat modeling, and penetration testing. IBM Cloud follows the IBM Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) process for security incident management. See the [IBM Security Vulnerability Management (PSIRT)](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-security-vulnerability-management) site for details.\n\nIn addition to the regular penetration testing conducted by IBM and our partners, customers may conduct penetration testing of their VPC or Classic Infrastructure resources on IBM Cloud.

To configure a stateful firewall, you must dictate which rules you want to operate statefully.\n\nTo enable 'stateful' tracking of tcp, udp, or icmp traffic, run the following commands:\n\nset security firewall global-state-policy icmp\nset security firewall global-state-policy tcp\nset security firewall global-state-policy udp\n\nNote that the global-state-policy commands will only track the state of traffic that has matched a firewall rule which explicitly sets the corresponding protocol. For example:\n\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATELESS rule 1 action accept\n\nAs GLOBAL_STATELESS does not specify protocol tcp, the global-state-policy tcp command would not apply on this rule.\n\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP rule 1 action accept\nset security firewall name GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP rule 1 protocol tcp\n\nIn this case protocol tcp is explicitly defined. The global-state-policy tcp command would enable stateful tracking of traffic that matches rule 1 of GLOBAL_STATEFUL_TCP", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-manage-your-ibm-firewalls"}]}

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced. Changes that you make in one area must be evaluated and coordinated with changes that you make in another area. For example, if you add an entity type, review the guidelines for annotating relation types and specify how the new entity type can relate to other entity types.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotation guidelines example \n\nMost annotation guidelines will need a lot of detail and examples to ensure that human annotators consistently annotate text.\n\nThe example presented here is a simple guideline that was created for a small domain that contains traffic incident reports.\n\n\n\n Task Goals \n\n\n\n* As project members, become familiar with the iterative process of manual annotation and machine learning model refinement.\n* Annotate documents in the automotive domain with the ground truth editor and use the annotations to train a machine learning model.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16410-8324-10312", "score": 0.7600361704826355, "text": "\nInter-annotator agreement scores cannot be calculated unless two or more human annotators annotate the same documents.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match.

For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

This can happen if a condition value is also referenced by a node that is not eligible for inclusion in the disambiguation list for some reason. For example, an entity mention might trigger a node that is situated earlier in the dialog tree but is not enabled for disambiguation. If the same entity is the only condition for a node that is enabled for disambiguation, but is situated later in the tree, then it might not be added as a disambiguation option because your assistant never reaches it. If it matched against the earlier node and was omitted, your assistant might not process the later node.\n<-- </ul> -->For each node that you opt in to disambiguation, test scenarios in which you expect the node to be included in the disambiguation options list. Testing gives you a chance to make adjustments to the node order or other factors that might impact how well disambiguation works at run time.When testing, the order in which the options are listed might change from test run to test run. In fact, the options themselves that are included in the disambiguation list might change from one test run to the next. Don't worry; this is the intended behavior. As part of development that is in progress to help the assistant learn automatically from user choices, the choices included and their order in the disambiguation list is being randomized on purpose.

If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 / 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance. Service availability is defined within the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Service Description](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/pdf/6605-17/$file/i126-6605-17_06-2019_en_US.pdf).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the data center have an impact on performance and reliability of a virtual server? \n\nNo, all of the data centers are of the same quality.

With IBM Cloud VPC, you can provision VNF devices to gain better and more affordable scalability than you would by purchasing physical network devices.\n\nTraffic destined for servers in IBM Cloud VPC must be delivered to healthy VNF devices; otherwise, traffic disruption occurs. You can use network load balancers with routing mode to perform health checks and to ensure that workloads only travel through healthy VNF devices. Because of this, network load balancers with routing mode support only VNF devices as back-end targets.\n\nFor detailed examples of various ways you can deploy your NLB with routing mode, refer to [HA VNF deployments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha&interface=ui).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites for NLB with routing mode \n\nTo support routing mode, you must first create a service-to-service authentication policy for your NLB.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "score": 0.7028577327728271, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple.

RS256 cryptography is a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures.

Its simplicity also means it can be misused. That's why it's important to verify that the messages sent to your assistant are coming from authorized users only.\n\nAfter you enable security, users cannot submit messages through the web chat unless you take steps to prove their origin. Do not enable it until you have support for authentication in place.\n\nBefore you enable security, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Create a RS256 private/public key pair.\n\nYou can use a tool such as the OpenSSL command line or PuTTYgen.\n\n\n\n* For example, to create the key pair: openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\n\n\n\n2. Use your private key to sign a JSON Web Token (JWT). You will pass the token with the messages that are sent from your website as proof of their origin.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify values for the following claims:\n\n\n\n* iss: Represents the issuer of the JWT.

For Lite plans, usage is measured by the number of /message calls (API) are sent to the assistant from the web chat integration. For all other plans, usage is measured by the number of monthly active users (MAU) that the web chat interacts with. The maximum number of allowed MAUs differs depending on your Watson Assistant plan type.\n\n\n\nPlan details\n\n Plan Maximum usage \n\n Enterprise Unlimited MAU \n Premium (legacy) Unlimited MAU", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.6620808839797974, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

For more information, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support). The responses from your assistant are defined by you in the underlying skill and can be written in any language you want.\n\nEven if your skill includes responses in a language other than English, some of the phrases that are displayed in the web chat widget are added by the web chat itself and do not come from the underlying skill. These hardcoded phrases are specified in English unless you choose to apply a different language.\n\nThere are language files that contain translations of each English-language phrase that is used by the web chat. You can instruct the web chat to use one of these other languages files by using the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nLikewise, the web chat applies an American English locale to content that is added by the web chat unless you specify something else. The locale setting affects how values such as dates and times are formatted.\n\nTo configure the web chat for customers outside the US, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16290-9825-10787", "score": 0.6574732661247253, "text": "\n\"uri\": \"sip:+18883334444\\@example.com\",\n\"transfer_headers_send_method\": \"refer_to_header\"\n}\n}\n}\n},\n\"agent_available\": {\n\"message\": \"Ok, I'm transferring you to an agent\"\n},\n\"agent_unavailable\": {\n\"message\": \"\"\n}\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\nMake sure you use the \\ escape characters so Watson Assistant does not misinterpret the @ as part of the entity shorthand syntax.\n5.

(For more information, see [Managing user identity information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-userid).)\n\nThis approach is sufficient for tracking unique users for billing purposes, but it is not secure and should not be used for access control. If you enable web chat security, you can use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to securely authenticate your users and control access to functions of your assistant that require authorization.\n\n\n\n Authenticating with the sub claim \n\nTo use this method for authenticating users, you must first enable the web chat security feature. For more information, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).\n\nWhen you create a JWT for the web chat, you must specify a value for the sub (subject) claim, which identifies the user.

For user-based plans, this user ID is used for billing purposes. (You cannot use the updateUserID() instance method to set the user ID if web chat security is enabled.) The same user ID is also used as the customer ID, which can be used to make requests to delete user data.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03166-22295-24113", "score": 0.6706183552742004, "text": "\n* [Genesys Cloud](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-web-chat-service-desk-starter/tree/main/src/genesys/webChat)\n* [NICE inContact](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-web-chat-service-desk-starter/tree/main/src/incontact/webChat)\n* [Twilio Flex](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-web-chat-service-desk-starter/tree/main/src/flex/webChat)\n* [Oracle B2C Service](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-web-chat-service-desk-starter/tree/main/src/oracle/webChat)\n\n\n\nThe starter kit reference implementations, while functional, are examples only, and have not been vetted for production use.

You can move the image back and forth through all the statuses and set dates to automatically change an image status. All status changes are tracked as an Activity Tracker event. You can filter your list of images based on status to aid in clean-up or tracking of your images.

Custom images that are published to a private catalog must be in available status and their statuses are maintained in the private catalog. If you try to change or schedule a change to their status in IBM Cloud VPC, the attempt fails.

If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant.

Use the following SpEL expression in a response to repeat the text that the user specified back in the response:\n\nYou said: <? input.text ?>.\n\nIf autocorrection is on, and you want to return the user's original input before it was corrected, you can use <? input.original_text ?>. But, be sure to use a response condition that checks whether the original_text field exists first.\n* Determining the number of words in user input: You can perform any of the supported String methods on the input.text object. For example, you can find out how many words there are in a user utterance by using the following SpEL expression:\n\ninput.text.split(' ').size()\n\nSee [Expression language methods for String](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methodsdialog-methods-strings) to learn about more methods you can use.\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks. I want to open a savings account and apply for a credit card. How does the dialog recognize and address both of them?

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09921-1508-2973", "score": 0.7210849523544312, "text": "\nsatisfied An affective response to perceived service quality \n sympathetic An affective mode of understanding that involves emotional resonance \n\n\n\n\n\n* Example response:\n\n{\n\"usage\": {\n\"text_units\": 1,\n\"text_characters\": 60,\n\"features\": 1\n},\n\"language\": \"en\",\n\"classifications\": [\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.564849,\n\"class_name\": \"excited\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.355816,\n\"class_name\": \"satisfied\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.126127,\n\"class_name\": \"polite\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.026995,\n\"class_name\": \"sympathetic\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.012211,\n\"class_name\": \"frustrated\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.011065,\n\"class_name\": \"sad\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.000872,\n\"class_name\": \"impolite\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Migrating from Watson Tone Analyzer Customer Engagement endpoint to Natural Language Understanding \n\nYou can migrate your [Watson Tone Analyzer customer-engagement](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/tone-analyzer?topic=tone-analyzer-utco) analysis requests to Natural Language Understanding.

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-index"}]}

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-27244-29158", "score": 0.6626488566398621, "text": "\n* Enhanced intent recognition and enhanced irrelevance detection\n* Enhanced intent recognition and existing irrelevance detection\n* Existing intent recognition and enhanced irrelevance detection\n* Existing intent recognition and existing irrelevance detection\n\n\n\nFor French, Italian, and Spanish, you can use the API to set your assistant to these combinations:\n\n\n\n* Enhanced intent recognition and enhanced irrelevance detection\n* Existing intent recognition and existing irrelevance detection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15 September 2021 \n\nDialog skill \"Try it out\" improvements\n: The Try it out pane now includes these changes:\n\n\n\n* It now includes runtime warnings in addition to runtime errors.\n* For dialog skills, the Try it out pane now uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) UI framework similar to the rest of the Watson Assistant user interface.

Also check that intents which are considered irrelevant by Watson based on their confidence score are not returned. To do so, change the condition as follows:\n\n!irrelevant && intents[0].intent.startsWith(\"User_\")\n* How fuzzy matching impacts entity recognition: If you use an entity as the condition and fuzzy matching is enabled, then @entity_name evaluates to true only if the confidence of the match is greater than 30%. That is, only if @entity_name.confidence > .3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Storing and recognizing entity pattern groups in input \n\nTo store the value of a pattern entity in a context variable, append .literal to the entity name. Using this syntax ensures that the exact span of text from user input that matched the specified pattern is stored in the variable.\n\n\n\n Variable Value \n\n email \n\n\n\nTo store the text from a single group in a pattern entity with groups defined, specify the array number of the group that you want to store. For example, assume that the entity pattern is defined as follows for the @phone_number entity. (Remember, the parentheses denote pattern groups):\n\nb((958)|(555))-(d{3})-(d{4})b\n\nTo store only the area code from the phone number that is specified in user input, you can use the following syntax:\n\n\n\n Variable Value \n\n area_code \n\n\n\nThe groups are delimited by the regular expression that is used to define the group pattern. For example, if the user input that matches the pattern defined in the entity @phone_number is: 958-234-3456, then the following groups are created:\n\n\n\nGroup details\n\n Group number Regex engine value Dialog value Explanation \n\n groups[0] 958-234-3456 958-234-3456 The first group is always the full matching string.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tips"}]}

It is designed to help customers with an IPv4-only origin to accept connections from IPv6 clients, convert from IPv6 to IPv4 at the Edge, and go forward to the origin with IPv4.\n\nCreating an IBM Cloud CDN using an IPv6 address as the origin server address is not supported.\n* Are there any restrictions on what HTTP and HTTPS port numbers are allowed for Akamai?\n\nYes.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16449-0-679", "score": 0.6606996059417725, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Browser requirements \n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for IBM Watson\u2122 Knowledge Studio.\n\n\n\n*  Google Chrome: Latest version for your operating system (Chrome provides the best performance when using the ground truth editor)\n*  Firefox: Latest regular and Extended Support Release (ESR) versions for your operating system.\n\n> Note: If you open Knowledge Studio in a Private Browsing window, then you must disable the tracking protection feature or allow pop-ups for Knowledge Studio sites to ensure that all the application functions will work properly.\n\n\n\nFor the best performance, use a screen resolution of at least 1024x1280.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-system-requirements"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04163-3077-4013", "score": 0.6565591096878052, "text": "\n\"datetime\": \"2020-04-24T10:11:24Z\",\n\"source\": \"waf\",\n\"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.163 Safari/537.36\"\n},\n{\n\"action\": \"log\",\n\"clientAsn\": \"5089\",\n\"clientCountryName\": \"GB\",\n\"clientIP\": \"203.0.113.69\",\n\"clientRequestPath\": \"/%3Cscript%3Ealert()%3C/script%3E\",\n\"clientRequestQuery\": \"\",\n\"datetime\": \"2020-04-24T10:11:24Z\",\n\"source\": \"waf\",\n\"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.163 Safari/537.36\"\n},\n{\n\"action\": \"log\",\n\"clientAsn\": \"5089\",\n\"clientCountryName\": \"GB\",\n\"clientIP\": \"203.0.113.69\",\n\"clientRequestPath\": \"/%3Cscript%3Ealert()%3C/script%3E\",\n\"clientRequestQuery\": \"\",\n\"datetime\": \"2020-04-24T10:11:24Z\",\n\"source\": \"waf\",\n\"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.163 Safari/537.36\"\n},", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-graphql-firewall-events-example"}]}
