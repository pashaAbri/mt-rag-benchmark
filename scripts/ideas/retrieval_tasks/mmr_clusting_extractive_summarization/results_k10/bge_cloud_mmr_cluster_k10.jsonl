You can also add more metrics by creating custom metrics and adding integrations.\n\n\n\n Metrics and labels \n\nA metric is a quantitative measure that has one or more labels to define its characteristics.\n\nUse metrics to analyze statistically data that has numerical values.\n\nA metric is represented by time series. A time-series is a unique combination of a metric name and label key-value pairs. For example: website_failedRequest |region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'. A data-point is the value generated for a time-series at a given point in time.\n\nLabels are classified as infrastructure labels and metric descriptor labels. Each metric has a set of pre-defined labels. For custom metrics, you can configure more labels.\n\nYou can use labels to identify and differentiate characteristics of a metric, for example,\n\n\n\n* You can group infrastructure objects into logical hierarchies.\n* You can filter out data.\n* You can split aggregated data into segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Collecting default metrics by using the Monitoring agent \n\nWhen you configure a Monitoring agent, data for default metrics is automatically collected. These metrics include metadata that you can use to label, segment, and display metrics when you monitor them. You do not need additional instrumentation or configuration in your hosts to obtain metrics that are collected automatically by the agent to gain insight into what is happening in them.\n\nTo monitor your infrastructure, network, and applications with the IBM Cloud\u00ae Monitoring service, you can deploy Monitoring agents on supported hosts. The host determines the agent type that you can deploy. The agent type determines the metrics that are collected automatically for that host.\n\nTo start collecting default metrics, you must configure a Monitoring agent per environment that you want to monitor.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-collect-metrics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09785-4226-5753", "score": 0.6819460988044739, "text": "\n* Classic metrics have been replaced with context-explicit metrics.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test? That works on every other database that you ever used, correct?\n\nNot on IBM Cloudant.\n\nOr rather, it works 99 times out of 100.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-in-practice"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05032-7-2136", "score": 0.6829509735107422, "text": "\nUsing Immutable Object Storage to protect buckets \n\nImmutable Object Storage preserves electronic records and maintains data integrity.

Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When you place an object in the bucket, a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the time of the object write.\n\nIf your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and Retain Until Date, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.\n\nLike all other Object Lock settings, the Retain Until Date applies to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.\n\nImagine an object that is 60 days into a 90-day retention period, and you overwrite that object with the same name and a two year retention period. The operation will succeed and a new version of the object with a two year retention period is created. Meanwhile, after 30 more days the original version is eligible for deletion.\n\n\n\n\n\n Extending a retention period \n\nTo extend the retention period of an object, simply send a request to set a new, longer, retention period.

However, legal holds are more flexible and don't have a defined temporal component. Instead they simply remain in effect until removed. Legal holds can be freely placed and removed by any user who has the cloud-object-storage.object.put_object_lock_legal_hold and cloud-object-storage.object.put_object_lock_legal_hold_version actions.\n\nLegal holds have the additional benefit of acting as method for applying indefinite retention on an object.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05032-7-2136", "score": 0.7235950231552124, "text": "\nUsing Immutable Object Storage to protect buckets \n\nImmutable Object Storage preserves electronic records and maintains data integrity.

The portable SAN is built on IBM Cloud's all flash storage clusters rather than the local host storage.

If a host fails, virtual server instances that use SAN-based storage are automatically migrated to other hosts and restarted.\n\nPortable storage is an ideal solution if you want to transfer data between virtual servers that exist in any data center on IBM Cloud's network.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04869-7924-8861", "score": 0.7242043018341064, "text": "\nYou can manage your keys manually by supplying your own encryption keys - referred to as Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).\n\n\n\n\n\n Archive rules \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage Archive is a low-cost option for data that is rarely accessed.

These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

One NLU item is one text unit (up to 10,000 characters of text) that is analyzed for one feature, such as sentiment.\n\nTo keep track of the number of NLU items in your request, you can examine the usage object in the response. For example, analyzing 15,000 characters of text for sentiment, emotion, and keywords will return the following usage information.\n\n\"usage\": {\n\"text_units\": 2,\n\"text_characters\": 15000,\n\"features\": 3\n}\n\nThere are 2 text units and 3 features in the request, so there are 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 NLU items.\n\nText units are counted seperately for each request.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances. Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13336-1484-3613", "score": 0.7034007906913757, "text": "\n* Use of all available models (same as the Lite plan).\n* Unlimited creation and use of custom language and custom acoustic models at no extra charge.\n* A maximum of one hundred concurrent transcription requests from all interfaces, WebSocket and HTTP, combined.\n\n\n\nThe plan uses a simple tiered pricing model to give high-volume users further discounts as they use the service more heavily. Pricing is based on the aggregate number of minutes of audio that you recognize per month:\n\n\n\n* Users who recognize 1 to 999,999 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.02 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n* Users who recognize at least 1,000,000 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.01 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n\n\n\nThe Plus plan is intended for small businesses. It is also a good choice for large enterprises that want to develop and test larger applications before considering moving to a Premium plan. For more information, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I continue to use the Speech to Text Standard plan? \n\nThe Standard plan is no longer available for purchase by new users. But existing users of the Standard plan can continue to use the plan indefinitely with no change in their pricing. Their API settings and custom models remain unaffected.\n\nExisting users can also choose to upgrade to the new Plus plan by visiting the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text). They will continue to have access to all of their settings and custom models after upgrading. And, if they find that the Plus plan does not meet their needs for any reason, they can always downgrade back to their Standard plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n What pricing plan do I need to use the service's customization interface? \n\nYou must have a paid plan (Plus, Standard, or Premium) to use language model or acoustic model customization. Users of the Lite plan cannot use customization. To use customization, users of the Lite plan must upgrade to a paid plan such as the Plus plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11142-1400-2265", "score": 0.7025959491729736, "text": "\nGo to the [catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog).\n2.

When you create the enterprise, the account is added to the enterprise hierarchy. Billing transitions to being managed by the enterprise, but its users and resources remain the same and are completely unaffected. For a complete description of account impacts, see [Creating an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-create-enterprise).\n\n\n\n1. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Enterprise, and click Create.\n2. Enter the name of your company, such as Example Corp, to identify your enterprise.\n3. Enter your company's domain, such as examplecorp.com.\n4. Review the information about the impact to your account, and select I understand the impact to my account. Then, click Create. The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize). The second and third tier of the Example Corp. enterprise hierarchy contain the Marketing, Development, Sales, Design, and Engineering account groups.

Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search. For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

These query characteristics can impact performance:\n\n\n\n1. Length - Longer queries most likely have poorer performance.\n2. Aggregations - Aggregations are a more complex query type, with nested aggregations having the highest impact on performance.\n3. Operators - Wldcarding and fuzzy matching can impact performance.\n4. Counts - Reducing the count of documents returned can improve performance; if you need to page through results, use the offset parameter.\n5. Return fields - Limiting the fields returned to only those needed for your application can help (For example, don\u2019t return the full text of the document if only the title and passage are needed.)\n\n\n\nSee [Query reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-reference) for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n Features used \n\nThere are a number of features that enhance query results. The following features can impact performance:\n\n\n\n1. Passage Retrieval - Passage retrieval searches within documents to find relevant snippets of text for your query. Use the passages.fields parameter to adjust which fields in the documents that passage retrieval searches. The parameter can help reduce the latency of passage retrieval when your content has many fields. For more information about passage retrieval, see [Passages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parameterspassages).\n2. Relevancy Training - Relevancy training computes features for each top-level text field (fields at the same level as document_id in the JSON) in the collection. If there are many top level fields, this can cause a performance impact for a natural_language_query when using training. Reducing the number of top level fields can improve performance. This can be done via normalization or by manually editing the JSON to put fields that are not helpful to finding relevant content in a nested structure. Changing the fields used for training also has an impact on the model so you\u2019ll need to consider both the impact to performance and accuracy of results if making this change.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-qp"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07175-7-2035", "score": 0.6613402962684631, "text": "\nViewing metrics and improving query results with the Performance dashboard \n\nThe Performance dashboard in the Discovery tooling can be used to view query metrics, as well as improve query results, including query relevance.\n\nYou can access the Performance dashboard by clicking the View data metrics icon.

The passages are generated by sophisticated Watson algorithms to determine the best passages of text from all of the documents returned by the query. This enables you to find information and context more precisely. See the [Query your collection](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discoveryquery-your-collection) method in the API reference for information. : Specifying passages=true in your query can reduce performance as a result of increased processing to extract passages. With larger environments, the performance impact can be lessened. : The passages parameter is supported only on private collections. It is not supported in the Watson Discovery News collection. : The passages parameter currently returns a maximum of 10 results. The number of returned results cannot be changed. [Update](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parameterspassages_count) : The passages parameter returns a maximum of three (3) passages from any given document in the collection.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00460-34449-36370", "score": 0.7809543013572693, "text": "\nQuery (_find endpoint) improved\n: IBM Cloudant Query now uses a new method to select an index.

For more information, see [Creating a partial index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) to learn about the partial_filter_selector parameter.\n\nExecution statistics\n: Execution statistics about a query can now be generated. These statistics are enabled by using the execution_stats=true parameter.

Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to /$DATABASE/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body. The type field of the JSON object must be set to json. A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST /$DATABASE/_index HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 0.7751277089118958, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

The same package can list multiple vulnerabilities, and in this case, a single package update can address multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability Advisor returns vulnerabilities only when a package fix is published by the distributor. Declared vulnerabilities that aren't fixed yet, or are not going to be fixed, are not reported by Vulnerability Advisor.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies.

By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS.

For existing accounts, provisioning scripts are managed within the IBM Cloud\u00ae console. During the ordering process, you can manually enter scripts for new accounts or scripts that are not yet tracked.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a cloud-init enabled image and provide user data to automatically perform configuration tasks or run scripts. For more information, see [Provisioning with a cloud-init enabled image](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/image-templates?topic=image-templates-provisioning-with-a-cloud-init-enabled-image).\n\nDuring the provisioning process, scripts that are associated with an HTTP URL are downloaded to the device.

If your entry point is not main, a custom name can be specified when the action is created, so take note of that name.\n* Input parameters into your app and output results from your app must be formatted into a specific structure that can be passed between entities.

Because you cannot use the console to deploy a smart contract that contains an Init function, you need to move that initialization logic into the smart contract itself and call it separately.

When you call the script with the build option, it configures a single node ordering service, a peer organization and a peer. It installs the FabCar smart contract on the peer, creates a channel and joins the peer to the channel. If you run the script with the destroy option it removes all of these artifacts from your cluster.

Therefore, multiple clusters are generally more complex to manage, but can help you achieve important goals such as the following.\n\n\n\n* Comply with security policies that require you to isolate workloads.\n* Test how your app runs in a different version of Kubernetes or other cluster software such as Calico.\n* Create a cluster with your app in another region for higher performance for users in that geographical area.\n* Configure user access on the cluster-instance level instead of customizing and managing multiple RBAC policies to control access within a cluster at the namespace level.\n\n\n\nFewer or single clusters: Fewer clusters can help you to reduce operational effort and per-cluster costs for fixed resources. Instead of making more clusters, you can add worker pools for different flavors of computing resources available for the app and service components that you want to use. When you develop the app, the resources it uses are in the same zone, or otherwise closely connected in a multizone, so that you can make assumptions about latency, bandwidth, or correlated failures.

If either the number of devices or the number of outbound digital messages exceeds the permitted limit, the permitted number of devices is moved by additional 500 devices or by additional 5000 messages and charged.\n\nFor example, if you tried to send 5001th message, the message cap automatically is raised to 10000 (another 5000 messages are added) for the month and the device cap is raised to 1000 (another 500 devices are added) per month. Notice that both limits are always raised even if only one cap has been exceeded.\n\n\n\n\n\n Push charges for changing from pre-production destination to production destination \n\nYou can change a pre-production destination to a production destination at any particular time and the charges are calculated accordingly.\n\nThe push service has two components to pricing: a destination instance fee and a consumption price.\n\nA pre-production destination instance fee is charged monthly.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption.

If you use this action with a conditional response, be sure to word the conditional response such that you clearly state what was wrong with the user's answer and what you expect them to provide instead.\n* Prompt again: After displaying the Not found response, your assistant repeats the slot prompt again and waits for the user to respond. If you use this action with a conditional response, the response can merely explain what was wrong about the answer the user provided. It does not need to reiterate the type of information you want the user to provide because the slot prompt typically explains that.\n\nIf you choose this option, consider adding at least one variation of the Not found response so that the user does not see the exact same text more than once.

For example, you might have a @seating entity that captures restaurant seating preferences, such as outside, near the fireplace, private, and so on. You can add a slot that prompts the user with, Do you have any seating preferences? and checks for @seating.values.

You can retrieve the key and token with the following CLI command:\n\nibmcloud fn property get --auth\n\nExample output\n\nwhisk auth kkkkkkkk-kkkk-kkkk-kkkk-kkkkkkkkkkkk:tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt\n\nThe string before the colon is your key, and the string after the colon is your token.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdk"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10852-45155-46272", "score": 0.6551750898361206, "text": "\n* [Configuring the mobile SDK](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkconfigure-mobile-sdk)\n\n\n\n* [Support for qualified names with mobile SDK](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkqualified-names-mobile-sdk)\n* [Invoking actions with mobile SDK from WhiskButton](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdkinvoke-mobile-sdk-actions-whiskbutton)\n\n\n\n\n\n[Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstoragepkg_obstorage)\n\n\n\n* [Packages for Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstorageobstorage_packages)\n* [Setting up the IBM Cloud Object Storage trigger](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstoragepkg_obstorage_ev)\n\n\n\n* [Prerequisites for working with the IBM Cloud Object Storage trigger](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_obstoragecos_changes_pre)\n* [1.

The interface lets the client send multiple requests to the service and receive results over a single connection in an asynchronous fashion.\n* Provides a much simpler and more powerful programming experience. The service sends event-driven responses to the client's messages, eliminating the need for the client to poll the server.\n* Allows you to establish and use a single authenticated connection indefinitely. The HTTP interfaces require you to authenticate each call to the service.\n* Reduces latency. Recognition results arrive faster because the service sends them directly to the client. The HTTP interface requires four distinct requests and connections to achieve the same results.\n* Reduces network utilization. The WebSocket protocol is lightweight. It requires only a single connection to perform live-speech recognition.\n* Enables audio to be streamed directly from browsers (HTML5 WebSocket clients) to the service.\n* Returns results as soon as they are available when you use a next-generation model or request interim results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using speech recognition parameters \n\nThe service's speech recognition interfaces share largely common parameters for transcribing speech to text.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-features"}]}

For more information about tokens and how they're used in App ID, see [Understanding tokens](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-tokens).\n\nBy customizing your token configuration, you can ensure that your security and user experience needs are met.

For example, if you signed into an application by using an identity provider, the provider would send the application a group of claims or statements about you to the app so that it can group with information that it already knows about you. This way, when you sign in, the app is set up with your information, in the way that you configured it.\n\n\n\n What types of claims can I define? \n\nThe claims that are provided by App ID fall into several categories that are differentiated by their level of customization.\n\nNormalized claims\n: In each identity token, there is a set of claims that is recognized by App ID as normalized. When available, the claims are mapped directly from your identity provider to the token by default. The claims can't be explicitly omitted but they can be overwritten in your token by custom claims. The claims include name, email, picture, and locale.\n\nRestricted claims\n: Restricted claims are those that have limited customization possibilities and cannot be overwritten by custom mappings.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

So what we need to do is make sure that we have it, again, centralized improperly stored so that we can leverage these secrets in the correct way and they can properly communicate with services.\n\nOK, now, let's look at the next layer of the onion in a more complicated example.\n\nNow let's go back to Jane, the enterprise developer. Jane \u2013 our \"E dev\" here \u2013 needs again to have access to that development repo that she's referring to earlier. Let's go ahead and call this, maybe it's GitHub. So what she needs to be able to do is have write access and so she's going to need to request the information that's going to give her access to that role. So that's where a secrets manager service comes in in a perfect, complementary fashion.\n\nA secrets manager service can securely store these credentials, along with other types of secrets, in a centralized way for her to be able to access or maybe other services to access, like we'll see in a second. But when it's done, it's given her the peace of mind that her user credentials are securely stored and now she can worry about authenticating with the service and getting her job done because secrets manager is going to take care of that for her.\n\nHowever, what's really important for secrets manager service to do is interact with the cloud service provider's IAM, or identity and access management service.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12498-1639-3565", "score": 0.6496418118476868, "text": "\nWith these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them.

For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done. What it needs, in the form of the secret here, is what we call \"DB configs.\" Again, this DB config is going to allow it to have the correct communication with the service by saying, this is who I am and this is what I came here to accomplish.\n\nBut now that we have our user credentials in our DB configs as examples of secrets, we realize the vulnerability that can be created here if these credentials were to fall into the wrong hands.

Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13481-6212-7871", "score": 0.7166779041290283, "text": "\nDownload the [Hive-compatible client](https://us.sql-query.cloud.ibm.com/download/catalog/hive-metastore-standalone-client-3.1.2-sqlquery-1.0.13.jar) and place it in a directory of your Apache Spark cluster that is not on the classpath.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.7063522934913635, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6511025428771973, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.6546264886856079, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04666-14564-15396", "score": 0.647551953792572, "text": "\nYour privacy choices\n\n![0_ti_146001191_Ver_2_mid_91628333-84d7-4531-b8f2-721f8124ac01_sid_cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542_vid_cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d_vids_0_msclkid_N_pi_918639831_lg_en-US_sw_3840_sh_2160_sc_30_nwd_1_tl_HTTP_20headers_20_7C_20IBM_20Cloud_20Docs_p_https_3A_2F_2Fcloud.ibm.com_2Fdocs_2Fcloud-foundry-public_3Ftopic_3Dcloud-foundry-public-http-headers_r_lt_796_evt_pageLoad_sv_1_rn_196001](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=146001191&Ver=2&mid=91628333-84d7-4531-b8f2-721f8124ac01&sid=cca51480229211eeac887b94c5a6c542&vid=cca50460229211ee874f7dc32b9b9a8d&vids=0&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=3840&sh=2160&sc=30&nwd=1&tl=HTTP%20headers%20%7C%20IBM%20Cloud%20Docs&p=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.ibm.com%2Fdocs%2Fcloud-foundry-public%3Ftopic%3Dcloud-foundry-public-http-headers&r=&lt=796&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&rn=196001)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-http-headers"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16385-3291-4480", "score": 0.6457076072692871, "text": "\n* You can [prevent unauthorized access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt) to sensitive customer information by encrypting it and including it as part of the JWT user payload.\n\nThe user payload is a part of the JWT you can use to send information you want your assistant to have access to, but that you do not want customers to see.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template. Review available service plans and pricing information for each resource that you are about to create.

Each IBM Cloud region contains [multiple availability zones](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/data-centers/) to meet local access, low latency, and security requirements for the region.\n\nAs you plan your encryption at rest strategy with IBM Cloud, keep in mind that provisioning Hyper Protect Crypto Services in a region that is nearest to you is more likely to result in faster, more reliable connections when you interact with the Hyper Protect Crypto Services APIs. Choose a specific region if the users, apps, or services that depend on a Hyper Protect Crypto Services resource are geographically concentrated. Users and services who are far away from the region might experience higher latency.\n\nYour encryption keys are confined to the region that you created them in. Hyper Protect Crypto Services does not copy or export encryption keys to other regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n In-region data redundancy and failover \n\nMultiple\n\ncrypto unitsin a service instance are automatically synchronized and load balanced across multiple availability zones.

For more information, see [Disaster recovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtimedisaster-recovery).\n\n\n\n\n\n Cross-region disaster recovery \n\nIBM also performs cross-region backup for your key resources.

Using subnet and VLAN networking in one pod works well until you must scale up or have large virtual resource demands that require resources to be created between pods. (Adding appliances for VLAN spanning can get expensive and complicated!)\n\nIBM Cloud VPC adds a network orchestration layer that eliminates the pod boundary, creating increased capacity for scaling instances. The network orchestration layer handles all of the networking for all virtual server instances that are within a VPC across regions and zones. With the software-defined networking capabilities that VPC provides, you have more options for multi-vNIC instances and larger subnet sizes.\n\nTo review and start deploying compute resources, see the following topics:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture.

If a zone is deleted, another zone or the same zone cannot be added during the Free Trial Plan.\n* How many Free Trial instances can I have?\n\nYou can have, at most, one Free Trial instance per account, for the lifetime of the account. If you already have a free trial instance, if you delete a free trial instance, or if the free trial expires, you are not allowed to create another free trial instance. You can, however, create instances of other paid plan types (for example, Standard), independent of any free trials you might have created.\n* Can I downgrade from Standard to the Free Trial?\n\nNo. Downgrading from Standard to a Free Trial plan is not allowed.\n* My Free Trial has expired. What are my options?\n\nTo avoid any data loss you must upgrade from Free Trial to Standard prior to the expiration date. After that, we only support upgrading the Plan or Deleting the CIS instance. If the instance is not deleted or upgraded after 45 days (from the initiation of the instance) the configuration domain, global load balancers, pools, and health checks are deleted automatically.\n* What happened to Enterprise Package plans?\n\nStarting on 21 June 2023, you can no longer configure the Enterprise package plan. The functionality of this plan was split across various tiers and are now available in Enterprise Essential, Enterprise Advanced, and Enterprise Premier plans. See [Transition to Enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-transitioning-next-plan).\n* How do I delete my CIS instance?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-755905-757955", "score": 0.6187222003936768, "text": "\nYou can, however, create instances of other paid plan types (for example, Standard), independent of any free trials you might have created.\n* Can I downgrade from Standard to the Free Trial?\n\nNo. Downgrading from Standard to a Free Trial plan is not allowed.\n* My Free Trial has expired.

See [Transition to Enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-transitioning-next-plan).\n* How do I delete my CIS instance?\n\nTo delete a CIS instance, you must first delete all global load balancers, pools, and health checks. Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there. Activating the domain before migrating from CIS can cause your domain to changed to a [Moved state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status).\n* I added a user to my account and gave that user permission to manage Internet Services instance(s).

It's automatically generated for you and includes your company name. If your company offers multiple products in IBM Cloud, the value of each service name includes both the company name and product name.\n\nYour programmatic name must be approved to create your pricing plans or registering your service broker.

A rotation policy automatically rotates your keys based on a schedule; manual rotation rotates keys on demand.\n\nIf you're using Hyper Protect Crypto Services, you can also rotate master keys by using [IBM Cloud TKE CLI plug-in](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-rotate-master-key-cli).

Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services allow one rotation per hour for each root key. The KMS replaces the key immediately upon your request. Use this option when you import a new root key to the KMS instance and want to rotate the key immediately.\n\nFor more information about these options, see [Comparing your key rotation options in Key Protect](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-rotationcompare-key-rotation-options).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-key-rotation"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16233-3661-5046", "score": 0.5943766236305237, "text": "\nTo see how Watson Assistant is helping enterprises cut costs and improve customer satisfaction today, read the [Independent study finds IBM Watson Assistant customers can accrue $23.9 million in benefits](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2020/03/independent-study-finds-ibm-watson-assistant-customers-accrued-23-9-million-in-benefits/) blog on ibm.com.\n\nRead more about these implementation steps by following these links:\n\n\n\n* [Building your assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-build-actions-overview)\n* [Publishing and deploying your assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-publish-overview)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe Watson Assistant application requires the same level of browser software as is required by IBM Cloud.

To determine whether your service instance provides a free allocation, go to the [Resources list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources) in the IBM Cloud console.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03729-4932-7001", "score": 0.6835355162620544, "text": "\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances. Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2. Simple tier pricing table\n\n Quantity of Items Unit Price for All Items", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12837-8834-10242", "score": 0.6824140548706055, "text": "\nBlock tier (up to) The total amount that is charged is established by an up to quantity that doesn't vary within the block If Q is <=Q1, T=T1<br><br>If Q1 < Q <=Q2, T=T2<br><br>If Q2 < Q <=Q3, T=T3 Q1=1000, T1=$0<br><br>Q2=2500, T2=2500<br><br>Q3=10000, T3=$4500<br><br>T=$4500 \n\n\n\nBlock tier pricing is not currently supported.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-1068047-1069909", "score": 0.6620926856994629, "text": "\nIf you manage your invoices through the IBM Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking Manage > Billing and usage, and selecting Invoices.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame.

The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before. The result is a dialog flow that more closely simulates a human-to-human conversation.<-- <ul> --> * Before you begin]] * Customizing digressions]] * Digression usage tips]] * Disabling digressions into a root node]] * Digression tutorial]] * Design considerations]] ! ! ! !!!! ! !", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02844-1555-3643", "score": 0.6526599526405334, "text": "\nconversation.counterexample.update edits a counterexample. \n conversation.data.update does a bulk action, such as importing a CSV file of intents or entities to the skill, or deleting multiple training data items, such as multiple entities or intents. \n conversation.entity.create creates an entity. \n conversation.entity.delete deletes an entity. \n conversation.entity.update edits an entity. \n conversation.example.create adds a user input example to an intent. \n conversation.example.delete deletes a user example from an intent. \n conversation.example.update edits a user example that is associated with an intent. \n conversation.intent.create creates an intent. \n conversation.intent.delete deletes an intent. \n conversation.intent.update edits an intent. \n conversation.log.create corrects an intent that was inaccurately categorized by the skill from the Analytics>User conversations page. \n conversation.node.create creates a dialog node. \n conversation.node.delete deletes a dialog node. \n conversation.node.update edits a dialog node. \n conversation.skill.create creates a skill, either dialog or search. \n conversation.skill.delete deletes a skill. \n conversation.skill.update updates a skill. \n conversation.skill_reference.create adds a specific skill to an assistant. \n conversation.skill_reference.delete removes a specific skill from an assistant. \n conversation.skill_reference.update updates a specific skill that is associated with an assistant. \n conversation.snapshot.create creates a version of a dialog skill. \n conversation.snapshot.delete deletes a version of a dialog skill. \n conversation.synonym.create creates a synonym for an entity value. \n conversation.synonym.delete deletes a synonym that is associated with an entity value. \n conversation.synonym.update edits a synonym that is associated with an entity value. \n conversation.userdata.delete deletes data that was created by a specified customer. \n conversation.value.create creates an entity value. \n conversation.value.delete deletes an entity value. \n conversation.value.update edits an entity value.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-audit-events"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03334-20892-22106", "score": 0.6523227691650391, "text": "\nRepeat the previous steps to resolve other intents with conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deleting intents \n\nYou can select a number of intents for deletion.\n\nIMPORTANT: By deleting intents that you are also deleting all associated examples, and these items cannot be retrieved later.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03273-13172-14845", "score": 0.7076066732406616, "text": "\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before. The result is a dialog flow that more closely simulates a human-to-human conversation.<-- <ul> --> * Before you begin]] * Customizing digressions]] * Digression usage tips]] * Disabling digressions into a root node]] * Digression tutorial]] * Design considerations]] ! ! ! !!!! ! !", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-212412-214326", "score": 0.6981236338615417, "text": "\n: In this release, you can customize node titles in dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n 22 December 2016 \n\nNode title section\n: In this release, dialog nodes display a new section for node title.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03273-6798-8762", "score": 0.7494304776191711, "text": "\nOn the node you want to copy, click the More(images/search_dialog.png)More icon][!!] icon, and then select Duplicate.\n2.

For example, you might group nodes that address questions about user accounts in a User account folder and nodes that handle payment-related queries in a Payment folder.\n* To group together a set of nodes that you want the dialog to process only if a certain condition is met. Use a condition, such as $isPlatinumMember, for example, to group together nodes that offer extra services that should only be processed if the current user is entitled to receive the extra services.\n* To hide nodes from the runtime while you work on them.

It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. The name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}]}

To benefit from the changes, you must manually upgrade your workspace.\n* The processing of Jump to actions changed to prevent loops that can occur under certain conditions. Previously, if you jumped to the condition of a node and neither that node nor any of its peer nodes had a condition that was evaluated as true, the system would jump to the root-level node and look for a node whose condition matched the input. In some situations this processing created a loop, which prevented the dialog from progressing.\n\n\n\nUnder the new process, if neither the target node nor its peers is evaluated as true, the dialog turn is ended. To reimplement the old model, add a final peer node with a condition of true. In the response, use a Jump to action that targets the condition of the first node at the root level of your dialog tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11 January 2017 \n\nCustomize node titles\n: In this release, you can customize node titles in dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n 22 December 2016 \n\nNode title section\n: In this release, dialog nodes display a new section for node title.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response.

With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

Wait for the etcd restoration to complete and the master state to return to deployed. \n updating The master is updating its Kubernetes version. The update might be a patch update that is automatically applied, or a minor or major version that you applied by updating the cluster. During the update, your highly available master can continue processing requests, and your app workloads and worker nodes continue to run. After the master update is complete, you can [update your worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-updateworker_node). If the update is unsuccessful, the master returns to a deployed state and continues running the previous version. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can check if the update failed in the Master Status field. \n update_cancelled The master update is canceled because the cluster was not in a healthy state at the time of the update. Your master remains in this state until your cluster is healthy and you manually update the master. To update the master, use the ibmcloud oc cluster master update[command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_cluster_update). If you don't want to update the master to the default major.minor version during the update, include the --version option and specify the latest patch version that is available for the major.minor version that you want, such as 1.26. To list available versions, run ibmcloud oc versions. \n update_failed The master update failed. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can continue to monitor the health of the master until the master reaches a normal state. If the master remains in this state for more than 1 day, [open an IBM Cloud support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-get-help).

For more information about deployments, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).\n\nPod\n: Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. Usually, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).\n\nApp\n: An app might refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You might deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate worker nodes.

The Heapster pod discovers all nodes in the cluster and queries usage information from each node's kubelet. You can find utilization graphs in the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nIngress ALB\n: Ingress is a Kubernetes service that you can use to balance network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to multiple apps in your cluster. To expose your apps over the public or private network, you must create an Ingress resource to register your apps with the Ingress application load balancer (ALB).

For more information, see [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n\nNamespace\n: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams. For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like kube-system or ibm-system. If you don't designate a namespace when you create a Kubernetes resource, the resource is automatically created in the default namespace. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).\n\nService\n: A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).\n\nDeployment\n: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations. You document a deployment in a configuration YAML file, and then apply it to the cluster.

The user provides the desired state and Kubernetes attempts to conform to, and then maintains the described state.\n\nThis [self-paced workshop](https://ibm.github.io/kube101/) can help you to get your first hands-on experience with Kubernetes.

Kubernetes clusters in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provide architectural options based on the needs of your apps. With a bit of planning, you can get the most out of your cloud resources without over-architecting or over-spending. Even if you over or underestimate, you can easily scale up or down your cluster, by changing either the number or size of worker nodes.\n\nTo run a production app in the cloud by using Kubernetes, consider the following items:\n\n\n\n1.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06480-1160-2754", "score": 0.7192420363426208, "text": "\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https://developer.ibm.com/depmodels/cloud/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/training/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/35-Connectivity.svg)](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/publiccloud/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06501-7-1686", "score": 0.7148670554161072, "text": "\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

Readings for all time for a specific device.\n2. Readings for today for a specific device.\n\n\n\nFor these two queries, you need to find the partition for the devices by using the global by-device index. Then, you can query the individual partition for readings. While you might use a global index to query for the readings for individual devices, the mapping from device to infrastructure ID is highly cache-able. It never changes! With this approach, you can mostly use the cheaper and more efficient partitioned query for most requests.\n\nUsing a global index to query directly for device readings might be more efficient if caching the device to infrastructure mapping doesn't work well for a specific application.\n\nTo find the relevant partition for a device, you query the by-device view, sending the device ID as the key:\n\ncurl -X POST \"$SERVICE_URL/readings/_design/infrastructure-mapping/_view/by-device' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{\n\"keys\": [\"device-123456\"], \"limit\": 1\n}'\n\nFor more language examples that show querying a global view, see the [Query a MapReduce view in API Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12904-23555-25450", "score": 0.7545509338378906, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant JSON documents and requests have the following maximum size limits:\n\n\n\nTable 4.

Its bigger brother, the Standard Plan, is a paid-for service where you specify the number of reads, writes, and queries per second for your application and that capacity is reserved for you. You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way. It has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database.

Exceeding this limit causes a [413 error](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).\n\nIBM Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem) model for data. If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field.

Instead, indexing is scheduled to happen later, providing a faster, non-blocking write throughput.\n\n\n\n* MapReduce views are indexes into the data set with key value pairs that are stored in a BTree for efficient retrieval by key or range of keys.\n* Search Indexes are constructed by using Apache Lucene to allow free-text search, faceting, and complex ad hoc queries.\n\n\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae's [search indexes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search) and [MapReduce views](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-views-mapreduce) are configured by adding design documents to a database.

They are thin wrappers around the IBM Cloudant HTTP API - so it's worth understanding the underlying API to understand all the parameters.\n\nThe libraries handle two things for you, which is useful:\n\nAuthentication\n: Exchanging your keys for tokens, whether it be legacy authentication or IAM.\n\nRetry logic\n: The libraries can be configured to retry API calls that exceeded your provisioned capacity. If configured this way, they pause and reattempt the API call multiple times with exponential back-off.\n\nRetrying such API calls is sensible if you have a temporary and unexpected elevation in traffic. If you are routinely exceeding your provisioned capacity, no amount of retrying gets the database work done - you need more capacity!\n\nThat's the end of this part.

These operations use the document's _id:\n\n\n\n* Fetch document by _id.\n* Update document whose _id = 'x'.\n* Delete document whose _id = 'x'.\n* Get documents in the _id range 'a' to 'z'.\n\n\n\nThese operations are the building blocks of a database, but they get you only so far.

You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill.

The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nThe actions skill is available as a beta feature.

For example, do not use periods, dashes, underscores, commas, end of sentence punctuation characters, and special characters such as dollar and euro signs, parentheses, brackets, and braces.\n* Use alphabetic characters that are valid for your language. For English, this includes a-z and A-Z. For other languages, valid characters can include accented letters or language-specific characters.\n* In English, substitute equivalent English letters for non-English or accented letters. For example, s for \u00e7, ny for \u00f1, or e for \u00e8.\n* Use real or made-up words that are pronounceable for words that are difficult to pronounce. For example, in English you can use the sounds-like shuchesnie for the word Sczcesny.\n* Use the spelling of numbers without dashes. For example, for the number 75, use seventy five in English, setenta y cinco in Spanish, and soixante quinze in French.\n* To pronounce a single letter, use the letter followed by a space. For example, use N C A A, notN. C. A. A., N.C.A.A., or NCAA.\n* You can include multiple words that are separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n* For most languages, the service enforces a maximum of 40 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces.\n* For Japanese, the service enforces a maximum limit of 25 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces. If you add a custom word or sounds-like that exceeds this limit, the service automatically treats the word as if it were added by a corpus.

In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module.

It is not available for next-generation models.\n\nYou can improve speech recognition accuracy by using complementary custom language and custom acoustic models. You can use both types of model during training of your acoustic model, during speech recognition, or both. The custom language and custom acoustic models must be owned by the same service instance, and both must customize the same base language model.\n\n\n\n Training a custom acoustic model with a custom language model \n\nThe following terms differentiate how a custom acoustic model is trained, alone or with a custom language model:\n\n\n\n* Unsupervised training refers to training a custom acoustic model with audio data alone. Training a custom acoustic model on audio alone can improve transcription quality if the characteristics of the custom model's audio match those of the audio that is being transcribed.\n* Lightly supervised training refers to training a custom acoustic model with a complementary, or \"helper,\" custom language model. Lightly supervised training is more effective than unsupervised training in improving the quality of speech recognition.\n\n\n\nUse lightly supervised training in the following cases:\n\n\n\n* When you have a custom language model that contains transcripts of your audio files.\n\nTranscribing your audio data is not strictly necessary. But training with a custom language model whose corpora are based on transcripts of your audio files can improve speech recognition. This is especially true if the audio data contains out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that are not found in the service's base vocabulary. The service can parse the contents of the transcriptions in context, extracting OOV words and n-grams that can help it make the most effective use of your audio data.\n* When you have a custom language model that is based on corpora or words that are relevant to the contents of your audio files.\n\nIf you don't have transcripts of your audio files, you can train with a custom language model that includes OOV words from the same domain as your audio data. Training with a custom language model that includes OOV words that are used in the audio can improve speech recognition.\n\n\n\nFor example, suppose you are creating a custom acoustic model that is based on call-center audio for specific products.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-useBoth"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16464-20282-21209", "score": 0.7114244103431702, "text": "\n10.

Once the custom model has been trained on the new words, training time returns to normal.\n\nFor more information, see\n\n\n\n* [Add a corpus to the custom language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageCreateaddCorpus)\n* [Add words to the custom language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageCreateaddWords)\n* [Train the custom language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageCreatetrainModel-language)\n* [Working with corpora and custom words for next-generation models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-corporaWords-ng)\n\n\n\nFurther improvements to updated next-generation language model customization", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-release-notes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13352-7-1738", "score": 0.7037449479103088, "text": "\nAdding a grammar to a custom language model \n\nBefore you can use a grammar for speech recognition, you must first use the customization interface to add the grammar to a custom language model.

[Create a custom language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammarAddcreateModel-grammar). You can create a new custom model or use an existing model.\n2. [Add a grammar to the custom language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammarAddaddGrammar). The service validates the grammar to ensure its correctness.\n3. [Validate the words from the grammar](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammarAddvalidateGrammar).

[Train the custom language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammarAddtrainGrammar).

For more information, see [Using a grammar for speech recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammarUse).\n\n\n\nThese steps are iterative. You can add grammars, as well as corpora and custom words, to a custom language model as often as needed.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored.

Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there. Activating the domain before migrating from CIS can cause your domain to changed to a [Moved state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status).\n\n\n\n\n\n I added a user to my account and gave that user permission to manage Internet Services instance(s). Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-faq"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14639-1516-2901", "score": 0.7619762420654297, "text": "\nEnsure that you do not have any NSX objects that are expanded into the secondary instance that you want to delete.\n3.

This connection allows a transit gateway to connect to overlay networks hosted on classic infrastructure resources.\n\nThis form of GRE tunnel is now deprecated, and we suggest using an unbound GRE tunnel instead. Unbound GRE tunnels provide the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The ability to receive classic network subnets from a classic connection.\n* The ability to communicate through other unbound GRE tunnels on the same transit gateway in the same availability zone.\n* Does not require a classic connection on the transit gateway. As a result, the classic network's subnets will not be advertised to the connections on the transit gateway (and vice versa).\n\n\n\nSee [Creating an Unbound Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel connection](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-unbound-gre-connection) for more information.\n\nMigrating your GRE tunnels to unbound GRE tunnels requires deleting any existing GRE tunnels before creating new unbound ones. Migration will also cause a network disruption for anything that uses the old GRE tunnel until you create the new one.\n\nTo migrate from a GRE tunnel to an unbound GRE tunnel:\n\n\n\n1.

This means that any IBM Cloud Foundry application that is being forwarded to as a custom domain, and has an SSL certificate uploaded to properly terminate that forward, needs to upload that SSL certificate again.\n\nThe upload process will put it in the proper place and the forward will keep working like it does today.\n\nSome notes about this process\n\n\n\n* You do not need to regenerate a new SSL certificate if it is still valid, you just need to upload it again\n* Be sure to upload it into the account that hosts your IBM Cloud Foundry application - multiple people can have access to an IBM Cloud account for deployment of applications, so be sure to use the one that holds that certificate currently.\n* If you uploaded certificates for multiple specific IBM Cloud regions, you need to upload them to the same regions again\n* Some users in their DNS forwarding to these custom domains are using only A records, or specific IP addresses, and not CNAME records, like \"custom-domain.us-south.cf.cloud.ibm.com\" like instructions explain. If you use A record IP addresses ONLY in your DNS forwarding, then this change may cause your application to not forward, even if you upload the SSL certificates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cloud Foundry domains \n\nYou can examine which domains you currently have set up on your IBM Cloud account that might be served by IBM Cloud Foundry applications, using one of the methods below.\n\n\n\n UI method \n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-custom_domain_usage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04626-7384-9372", "score": 0.7472141981124878, "text": "\n* Dallas (us-south) - 14 November 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Instructions \n\nIf you already have a valid SSL certificate for your custom domain, you need to upload it into a Secret Manager instance an authorise Cloud Foundry service to access it as per instructions in [Importing SSL certificates into IBM Cloud Secrets Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-ssl_csrssl_certificate_secrets_manager).\n\nIf you don't have a valid SSL certificate for your customs domains, you need to order one via a Certificate Authority before you can proceed with operations. Use the instructions in [Creating certificate signing requests](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-ssl_csr) to order it.

Packets can be accepted or dropped according to only basic access control list (ACL) criteria, such as the source and destination fields in the IP or Transmission Control Protocols/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) headers. A stateless Brocade 5400 vRouter does not store connection information and has no requirement to look up every packet's relation to previous flows, both of which consume small amounts of memory and CPU time. Therefore, raw forwarding performance is best on a stateless system.

Defining one or more sets of rules.\n2. Applying a set of rules to an interface or a zone. A zone consists of one or more network interfaces.\n\n\n\nIt is important to test firewall rules after creation to ensure the rules work as intended and that new rules do not restrict administrative access to the device.\n\nWhile manipulating rules on the dp0bond1 interface, it is advised to connect to the device using dp0bond0.

A stateless firewall will need rules for traffic in both directions, while stateful firewalls track connections and automatically allow the returning traffic of accepted flows. To configure a stateful firewall, you must dictate which rules you want to operate statefully.\n\nTo enable 'stateful' tracking of tcp, udp, or icmp traffic, run the following commands:\n\nset security firewall global-state-policy icmp\nset security firewall global-state-policy tcp\nset security firewall global-state-policy udp\n\nNote that the global-state-policy commands will only track the state of traffic that has matched a firewall rule which explicitly sets the corresponding protocol.

But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.\n\nGenerally, a type system that includes many entity types and relation types is open to more interpretation, thus inter-annotator agreement might be lower during the early phases of model development.

The machine learning model needs lots of examples to learn from. Adding more documents to the corpus might help. If your type system and documents are truly representative of a domain, you would expect to see that any randomly chosen documents contain a reasonable subset of the types. Although not true in all cases, this situation is a signal for you to investigate your type system and the quality of the documents in the corpus. You might need to find more domain documents that better exercise the types that are under-performing. If recall is low, it is often an indication that you need to add more documents.\n* Annotate corpus more\n\nIf the machine learning model is having trouble finding instances of certain types then it might be because the ground truth does not contain enough examples of the type's usage. Human annotators can sometimes be thorough about labeling entity type mentions, but be less diligent about annotating relation types and coreferences. For any key types that have a low percentage of corpus density, you might want to focus on finding more annotations of those type in the source documents.

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions.

In case you are using asynchronous calls, for example, when fetching data from Cloud Object Storage or Cloudant instances, it is unpredictable as to when the main() function fully completes its work. To ensure that the action runs to completion, use a Promise. A Promise in Node.js is a stand-in for an object. Using a promise allows you to return the object from a synchronous function immediately, but the actual result becomes available at a later point in time, when the promise is fulfilled.\n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions Node.js runtime container supports promises that are returned from the main() function. If you prefer working in a more synchronous fashion, you can also declare your main() function as an async function, which allows you to wait for asynchronous calls to complete before the function continues.\n\nExamples:\n\nfunction main() {\nreturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n...doGet(callback => {\nresolve(); // <-- this terminates action execution, as the Promise got resolved\n});\n...\ntry {\n...some synchronous code...\n} catch(e) {\n...log error...\nreject(e); // <-- this also terminates the execution, but reports the failure back to the runtime\n}\n});\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n...some synchronous code...\nawait doGet(....)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-ts_action_nodejs_fails"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03113-7328-8943", "score": 0.6585959196090698, "text": "\n* The parent cannot be a node of type response_condition or event_handler.\n\n\n\nThe resulting dialog looks like this:\n\n![Example dialog 3](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/dialog_api_3.png)\n\nIn addition to creating node_9, the service automatically updates the previous_sibling property of node_6 so that it points to the new node.\n\n\n\n\n\n Moving a node to a different parent \n\nLet's move node_5 to a different parent by using the POST /dialog_nodes/node_5 method with the following body:\n\n{\n\"parent\": \"node_1\"\n}\n\nThe specified value for parent must be valid:\n\n\n\n* It must refer to an existing node.\n* It must not refer to the node being modified (a node cannot be its own parent).\n* It must not refer to a descendant of the node being modified.\n* It must not refer to a node of type response_condition or event_handler.\n\n\n\nThis results in the following changed structure:\n\n![Example dialog 4](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/dialog_api_4.png)\n\nSeveral things have happened here:\n\n\n\n* When node_5 moved to its new parent, node_7 went with it (because the parent value for node_7 did not change).

However, if you add a client action to a node, then after evaluation, the service always returns to the client so that the result of the action call can be returned. To prevent waiting for user input when it should not, such as for a node that is configured to jump directly to a child node, the service adds the following value to the message context:\n\n{\n\"context\": {\n\"skip_user_input\": true\n}\n}\n\nIf you want the client to perform an action, but not get user input, then you can follow the same convention, and add the skip_user_input context variable to the parent node to communicate that to the client application.\n\nYour client application should always check for the skip_user_input variable on context. If present, then it knows not to request new input from the user, but instead execute the action, add its result into the message, and pass it back to the service. The new POST message request should include the message returned by the previous POST message response (namely, the context, input, intents, entities, and optionally the output section) and, instead of the JSON object that defines the programmatic call to make, it should include the result that was returned from the programmatic call.\n\nIn a child node that you jump to after this node, add the response to show the user:\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"text\": {\n\"values\": [\n\"It will be $my_forecast $date.literal in $location.literal.\"\n]\n}\n}", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-actions-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-4614-6320", "score": 0.6577264666557312, "text": "\n* Wait for user input: Your assistant pauses until new input is provided by the user.\n* Skip user input: Your assistant jumps directly to the first child node.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16295-7-1721", "score": 0.6826924681663513, "text": "\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "score": 0.707737386226654, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair.

The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

For more information, see [Applying advanced customizations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-config).\n\n\n\n\n\n Launcher appearance and behavior \n\nThe web chat launcher welcomes and engages customers so they know where to find help if they need it. By default, the web chat launcher appears in a small initial state as a circle in the bottom right corner:\n\n![An example of the initial launcher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-icon.png)\n\nAfter 15 seconds, the launcher expands to show a greeting message to the user. In this expanded state, a customer can still click the launcher to open the web chat. (If the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page before the launcher has expanded, the 15-second timer restarts.) There are two slightly different appearances for this expanded state, depending on whether the user is using a desktop browser or a mobile browser.\n\n\n\n* For desktop browsers, the expanded launcher shows two primary buttons the customer can click to open the web chat, and a Close button that closes the launcher:\n\n![An example of the desktop launcher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/desktop-launcher.png)\n\nThe expanded launcher remains in its expanded state even if the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03166-1557-3458", "score": 0.6293208003044128, "text": "\nA preview pane is displayed that shows you what the web chat looks like when it is embedded in a web page.

For more information, see [Private network endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-securitysecurity-private-endpoints).\n5. Optional: Customize the style of the chat window. You can make the following changes:\n\n\n\n* Assistant's name as known by customers: The name by which the assistant is known to users. This name is displayed in the header of the chat window. The name can be up to 64 characters in length.\n* Primary color: The color of the web chat header.\n\nClick the white dot to open a color switcher where you can choose a color. The color is saved as an HTML color code, such as FF33FC for pink and 329A1D for green. Alternatively, you can add an HTML color code directly to the field to set the color.\n* Secondary color: The color of the user input message bubble.\n* Accent color: The color of interactive elements, including:\n\n\n\n* Chat launcher button that is embedded in your web page\n* Send button associated with the input text field\n* Input text field border when in focus\n* Marker that shows the start of the assistant\u2019s response\n* Border of a button after it is clicked\n* Border of the drop-down list field as the user chooses an option", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.6227692365646362, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

If you use more than one integration type, focus on defining an engaging conversation in the underlying skill. The same skill is used for all integrations. To customize the conversation for the web chat only, you can take the following actions:\n\n\n\n* Update the text of a message before it is sent or after it is received, such as to hide personally-identifiable information.\n* Pass contextual information, such as the customer's name, from the web chat to the underlying skill.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-30333-32476", "score": 0.6084213256835938, "text": "\nIn the Message before link to web chat field, edit the introductory message to display to the user (in the originating channel) before the link that initiates the transfer.

If the output contains multiple responses (perhaps using different response types), these will be processed by both channels (before and after the transfer). If you want to target individual responses to specific channels, you can do so by editing the response using the JSON editor.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-30333-32476", "score": 0.6951584219932556, "text": "\nIn the Message before link to web chat field, edit the introductory message to display to the user (in the originating channel) before the link that initiates the transfer.

The user must then click the link to initiate the transfer.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred from one channel to another, the session history and context are preserved, so the destination channel can continue the conversation from where it left off. Note that the message output that contains the Channel transfer response is processed first by the channel that initiates the transfer, and then by the target channel. If the output contains multiple responses (perhaps using different response types), these will be processed by both channels (before and after the transfer). If you want to target individual responses to specific channels, you can do so by editing the response using the JSON editor.

If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant. After your assistant is live, the built-in metrics of active user conversations help you understand what your customers are asking about, how well your assistant is able to meet their needs, and what to focus on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n 3. Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant.

However, because the user's input includes the word tomorrow and the reservation node with slots is being processed, your assistant assumes the user is providing or updating the reservation date instead. The current node always gets priority. If you define a clear confirmation statement, such as, Ok, setting the reservation date to tomorrow, the user is more likely to realize there was a miscommunication and correct it.\n\nConversely, while filling slots, if the user provides a value that is not expected by any of the slots, there is a chance it will match against a completely unrelated root node that the user never intended to digress to.\n\nBe sure to do lots of testing as you configure the digression behavior.\n* When to use digressions instead of slot handlers: For general questions that users might ask at any time, use a root node that allows digressions into it, processes the input, and then goes back to the flow that was in progress. For nodes with slots, try to anticipate the types of related questions users might want to ask while filling in the slots, and address them by adding handlers to the node.\n\nFor example, if the node with slots collects the information required to fill out an insurance claim, then you might want to add handlers that address common questions about insurance. However, for questions about how to get help, or your stores locations, or the history of your company, use a root level node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disambiguation \n\nWhen you enable disambiguation, you instruct your assistant to ask users for help when it finds that more than one dialog node can respond to their input.

But there is one major difference between the redundancy that is provided in a mainframe and the redundancy that is provided in the cloud \u2013 in the cloud the redundancy must be managed by the user. This means that to design a system to run with high availability on the cloud the system designer needs to be familiar with various high availability issues, as well as the design issues associated with the system that they are trying to build.\n\nThere are decades of academic and practical writings on high availability, and much of the work requires a good understanding of probability mathematics. However, much like with the formula, many of the principles become obvious when properly explained. Redundancy, which can be complicated in some cases, such as the various levels of RAID disk subsystems, is simply a way of dealing with a widely known principle of system design: \u201cAvoid single points of failure.\u201d Admittedly, while the phrase is simple and obvious, implementation can be tricky.\n\nRather than go into the complexities of such implementations, we cover a high-level overview of the areas that need to be addressed by anyone looking to build or run a highly available cloud system.\n\nBeyond the general principles of redundancy, fast repair, and single points of failure (SPOFs), probably the most important thing to understand is that improving availability requires spending effort on avoiding likely causes of outages, rather than trying to harden the system against all possible outages.\n\nAn example can help to make this clear. In astronomy, it is understood that our solar system will effectively end when the Sun goes nova. This will obviously cause all the computing systems on Earth to fail. Hence it is not something worth spending time and money on avoiding. Perhaps that particular example seems too extreme. So as a much simpler, business-oriented example, consider a city-wide fire, such as the one that burned down much of Chicago in the late 1800s. Fires on that scale are unusual, but not unique. As a business, should you spend time and money making sure that your computer systems could survive such a fire?

The first is the old style of home smoke detector that didn\u2019t have a feature to indicate low battery. Without that feature, the homeowner did not have a way of knowing if the detector would work in the case of a fire. This omission could be worked around, and people would replace the battery once a year whether it needed it or not. The second example is the old style Christmas tree lights with incandescent colored light bulbs with all the lights connected in series (what were known as \u201csingle strand\u201d Christmas lights). Since the bulbs were connected in series, if any bulb burned out the entire string would not light up. The fix was to try replacing each light one at a time to see if the string would light up. Note that in both cases the lack of a detection method could be fixed by people driven processes. The same is true with lack of a computerized detection method. Unfortunately such methods do not scale well, but they do exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Redundancy options in IBM Cloud \n\nWhile the preceding discussion of the various aspects of achieving high availability in a cloud environment provides a useful framework for thinking about availability generally, it doesn\u2019t answer one of the key questions for teams looking to create an application to run on the cloud, or even those just looking to run an existing cloud-enabled application on a vendor provided public cloud. That question is what design options are actually available.\n\nWhile there are numerous technically feasible approaches to redundancy, IBM public cloud has simplified the possible alternatives to a set of four choices, where each choice has both geographic and technical aspects packaged together.\n\nNo redundancy\n: IBM allows a customer to lease just enough compute, storage, and network facilities to run a single instance of their system. This is the lowest cost option, available at data centers around the world, and comes with an availability target of 99.9% uptime, not including planned outages.\n\nLocal redundancy\n: This next level up provides two instances of the system in a single data center.
