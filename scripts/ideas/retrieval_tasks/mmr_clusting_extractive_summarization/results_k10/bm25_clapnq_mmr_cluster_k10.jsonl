Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 .

This has led to more younger players entering the league directly after high school graduation . In 2005 , the league and the players ' union agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement that includes a minimum age limit which requires that players who wish to enter the league must be at least 19 years old on December 31 of the year of the draft , and at least one year removed from high school .

Hockey is played usually with a ball , but last night , in order that no accident should happen , a flat block of wood was used , so that it should slide along the ice without rising , and thus going among the spectators to their discomfort . The game is like Lacrosse in one sense -- the block having to go through flags placed about 8 feet apart in the same manner as the rubber ball -- but in the main the old country game of shinty gives the best idea of hockey .

Torrance ( captain ) , Meagher , Potter , Goff , Barnston , Gardner , Griffin , Jarvis and Whiting . Creighton ( captain ) , Campbell , Campbell , Esdaile , Joseph , Henshaw , Chapman , Powell and Clouston . The match was an interesting and well - contested affair , the efforts of the players exciting much merriment as they wheeled and dodged each other , and notwithstanding the brilliant play of Captain Torrance 's team Captain Creighton 's men carried the day , winning two games to the single of the Torrance nine .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas , tetanus , septicaemia and tuberculosis . In the case of arm - to - arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis . Although this did occur occasionally , estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations , some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis .

However , private practitioners had to purchase vaccine from commercial producers . Although proper use of glycerine reduced bacterial contamination considerably the crude starting material , scraped from the skin of infected calves , was always heavily contaminated and no vaccine was totally free from bacteria . A survey of vaccines in 1900 found wide variations in bacterial contamination . Vaccine issued by the Government Vaccine Establishment contained 5,000 bacteria per gram , while commercial vaccines contained up to 100,000 per gram . The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1925 set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram , and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections . Unfortunately glycerolated vaccine soon lost its potency at ambient temperatures which restricted its use in tropical climates . However , it remained in use into the 1970s where a satisfactory cold chain was available . Animals continued to be widely used by vaccine producers during the Smallpox Eradication Campaign . A WHO survey of 59 producers , some of whom used more than one source of vaccine , found that 39 used calves , 12 used sheep and 6 used water buffalo , whilst only 3 made vaccine in cell culture and 3 in embryonated hens ' eggs .

Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America .

This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird . The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England , which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall , an Elizabethan manor house in Essex , and dated to around 1575 .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_14755-15684-0-929", "score": 37.399448114902285, "text": "Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species .

Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage . However , as lagomorphs , rabbits have different nutritional requirements , so the two species can not be fed the same food .

Safer bedding materials made from hardwoods ( such as aspen ) , paper products , and corn cob materials are other alternatives . Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages ; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them , and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces , making it difficult to remove .

The older American method is referred to a 1 V / Pa standard and measured in plain decibels , resulting in a negative value .

Roosevelt\nRoosevelt grew up in a wealthy family . His father , James Roosevelt I , graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851 , but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather , James Roosevelt . Roosevelt 's father was a prominent Bourbon Democrat who once took Franklin to meet President Grover Cleveland in the White House . Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin 's early years . She once declared , `` My son Franklin is a Delano , not a Roosevelt at all . '' James , who was 54 when Franklin was born , was considered by some as a remote father , though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time . Frequent trips to Europe -- he made his first excursion at the age of two and went with his parents every year from the ages of seven to fifteen -- helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French . He learned to ride , shoot , row , and play polo and lawn tennis . He took up golf in his teen years , becoming a skilled long hitter .

Roosevelt firmly established the United States ' leadership role on the world stage , with his role in shaping and financing World War II . His isolationist critics faded away , and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies . He also created a new understanding of the presidency , permanently increasing the power of the president at the expense of Congress . After his death , his widow , Eleanor , continued to be a forceful presence in US and world politics , serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally . Many members of his administration played leading roles in the administrations of Truman , Kennedy and Johnson , each of whom embraced Roosevelt 's political legacy .

The stream gradient becomes nearly flat , and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream meanders across the valley floor . In all stages of stream erosion , by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood , when more and faster - moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load . In such processes , it is not the water alone that erodes : suspended abrasive particles , pebbles and boulders can also act erosively as they traverse a surface , in a process known as traction .", "title": "Soil erosion", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "838108215_16758-16946-0-188", "score": 15.56929005890585, "text": "Carbon dioxide\nSuch reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling , or both , as the gas is released .

A variety of oily and dry forms of the retinol esters , retinyl acetates and retinyl palmitate are available for food fortification of vitamin A. Margarine and oil are the ideal food vehicles for vitamin A fortification . They protect vitamin A from oxidation during storage and prompt absorption of vitamin A.

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_3763-4293-0-530", "score": 20.24495555723102, "text": "Infertility\n`` Infertility is `` a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse ( and there is no other reason , such as breastfeeding or postpartum amenorrhoea ) .

The most sought - after donors tend to be those who are ( 1 ) proven ( i.e. , have donated before and produced a pregnancy from it , proving themselves both fertile and reliable ) ; ( 2 ) conventionally attractive ; ( 3 ) healthy , with good family health histories ; and ( 4 ) smart , well educated .", "title": "Egg donation", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801197945_8054-9488-0-1434", "score": 48.89822632913936, "text": "Egg donation\nDonors unrelated to the recipients who do it for altruistic and / or monetary reasons .

When the Jesuits brought back the first reports of the Wall to the West , European scholars were puzzled that Marco Polo had not mentioned the presumably perennial `` Great Wall '' in his Travels . Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation . About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson 's disease .

The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions . Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington 's gene . At that time surveys indicated that 50 -- 70 % of at - risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing , but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested . Over 95 % of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing , mostly because there is no treatment . A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD , compared to the impact of a positive result . Irrespective of the result , stress levels have been found to be lower two years after being tested , but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result . Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected . Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result , which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual 's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it . In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46 % of individuals at risk for Huntington 's disease . It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations . Genetic counseling in HD can provide information , advice and support for initial decision - making , and then , if chosen , throughout all stages of the testing process . Because of the implications of this test , patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington 's .", "title": "Huntington's disease", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "834242094_13372-14454-0-1082", "score": 31.01173826943772, "text": "Huntington's disease\nTrinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are unstable during replication , and this instability increases with the number of repeats present . This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass ( dynamic mutations ) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat . This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations , such that an unaffected parent with an `` intermediate '' number of repeats ( 28 -- 35 ) , or `` reduced penetrance '' ( 36 -- 40 ) , may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD . Such increases in the number of repeats ( and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease ) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation . Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis ; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length , whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length . It is rare for Huntington 's disease to be caused by a new mutation , where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats .", "title": "Huntington's disease", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "834242094_51463-51705-0-242", "score": 29.918038334734838, "text": "Huntington's disease\nAt roughly the same time as the HDF formed , Marjorie Guthrie helped to found the Committee to Combat Huntington 's Disease ( now the Huntington 's Disease Society of America ) , after her husband Woody Guthrie died from complications of HD .", "title": "Huntington's disease", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

AFL teams began to sign NFL players to contracts , and the league 's popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL . The two leagues merged in the 1970 season , and all AFL teams joined the NFL . An earlier league , the All - America Football Conference , was in play from 1946 to 1949 . After the league dissolved , two AAFC teams , the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers , became members of the NFL ; another member , the Baltimore Colts joined the league , but folded after just a year in the NFL .", "title": "American football", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

While most of the home teams in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys , there have been six ( 6 ) exceptions : the Dallas Cowboys during Super Bowl XIII and XXVII , the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII , the Pittsburgh Steelers during Super Bowl XL , the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl 50 , and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII .

Of all Shakespeare 's plays , the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was Macbeth , as Chinese audiences saw in a play first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland a parallel with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s . The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and furthermore , the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power - hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing . Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' . Another critic , Zhao Xun wrote `` Macbeth is the fifth Shakespearean play produced on the Chinese stage after the smashing of the Gang of Four .

Later on , in the 19th century , the novelist Ivan Turgenev often wrote essays on Shakespeare with the best known being `` Hamlet and Don Quixote '' . Fyodor Dostoevsky was greatly influenced by Macbeth with the his novel Crime and Punishment showing Shakespearean influence in his treatment of the theme of guilt .

The play 's director , the Shakespearean scholar Fang Ping who had suffered during the Cultural Revolution for studying this `` bourgeois Western imperialist '' , stated in an interview at the time that King Lear was relevant in China because King Lear , the `` highest ruler of a monarchy '' created a world full of cruelty and chaos where those who loved him were punished and those who did not were rewarded , a barely veiled reference to the often capricious behavior of Mao , who punished his loyal followers for no apparent reason .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel .

As a pilot enters a turn , hair cells in the semicircular canals are stimulated , telling the brain that the aircraft , and the pilot , are no longer moving in a straight line but rather making a banked turn . If the pilot were to sustain a constant rate turn , the endolymph would eventually catch up with the ducts and cease to deflect the cupula . The pilot would no longer feel as if the aircraft was in a turn . As the pilot exits the turn , the semicircular canals are stimulated to make the pilot think that they are now turning in the opposite direction rather than flying straight and level . In response to this , the pilot will often lean in the direction of the original turn in an attempt to compensate for this illusion . A more serious form of this is called a graveyard spiral . Rather than the pilot leaning in the direction of the original turn , they may actually reenter the turn .
