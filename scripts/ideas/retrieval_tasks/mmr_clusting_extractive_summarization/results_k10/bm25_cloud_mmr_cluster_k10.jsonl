This includes the vSRX 18.4 1G SR-IOV offering. The older vSRX 18.4 1G Standard offering is based on Linux Bridging and has different network configurations on the Ubuntu host, the KVM hypervisor, and in the vSRX configuration. The host and KVM settings do not require any special migration steps, as the automation process handles the configuration changes. However, if you want to import the vSRX configuration from the legacy architecture into the current vSRX configuration, you likely need to refactor some of the configuration.\n\n\n\n Migrating 1G vSRX standalone configurations \n\nThere are some steps you potentially need to convert vSRX configuration settings on a Standalone 18.4 1G Public+Private Linux Bridge (legacy architecture) instance to a Standalone 18.4 1G Public+Private SR-IOV (current architecture) instance.\n\nYou can find a sample default configuration for SR-IOV based current architecture [in this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-understanding-the-vsrx-default-configurationdefault-configuration-of-a-sample-standalone-vsrx-gateway).\n\nThe following is a sample default configuration for the Linux Bridge (legacy architecture).

The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity / Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05138-7979-9034", "score": 21.25385124092189, "text": "\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}]}

See the following example of such a statement:\n\nSELECT ...\nFROM cos://source1 JOIN cos://source2 ON ... JOIN ...\nINTO cos://target STORED AS ... PARTITIONED BY ...\n\nYou can run this type of statement (with a user-defined INTO clause) by the Statement.executeUpdate method. This statement does not give you a result set in the JDBC client (and avoids all overhead for result fetching), but creates a target object with the specific format and partitioning that you need.\n\nYou cannot run statements with an INTO clause by using the generic Statement.execute() method because the driver cannot detect to treat these statements as an update, not a query. Therefore, the driver generates a second INTO clause, leading to a syntax error.\n\n\n\n\n\n JDBC driver logging \n\nJDBC driver logging uses the java.util.logging framework, similar to the [postgresql JDBC driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/logging/). However, since driver version 2.5.30, logging is turned off by default to avoid unexpected console output in a default logging configuration.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16242-1610-3614", "score": 22.914953156945415, "text": "\nFor example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

If two actions have similar phrase examples, then the wrong action might get triggered by your user's question.\n\n\n\n Confidence scoring \n\nBehind the scenes, Watson Assistant determines a confidence score for each phrase.

Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-1075256-1077185", "score": 28.78262695642407, "text": "\n* To close a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, go to the [Support Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter), and click Create a case in the Contact Support center.

Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis.

This conversion improves query execution time by at least one order of magnitude. For more information about data optimization on Object Storage, see [How to Layout Big Data in IBM Cloud Object Storage for Spark SQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout).\n\nThe following SQL statement is an ETL job addresses two aspects that contribute significantly to query execution time:\n\n\n\n* object size - Flow logs have a maximum size of 100 KB. An optimal object size for a query is approximately 128 MB.\n* data format - Flow logs are stored as compressed JSON. The optimal format for queries is parquet, which allows to read only the columns that a query needs, not the whole object.\n\n\n\nNote the INTO clause, which defines the target location and partitioning layout of the data that is produced by this ETL job.\n\nImportant: Replace these variables in the following steps:\n\n\n\n* bucket - The bucket where you want to store the optimized flow logs.\n* region - The [region alias](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-queryendpoints) of the bucket that holds your flow logs.\n\n\n\nTo optimize flow logs layout with IBM Cloud\u00ae Data Engine, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

To use the content from the Cache Store, Edge servers use a Cache Key. Typically, a cache key is generated based on a portion of a user's URL. In some cases, the URL contains query function arguments that are different for individual users, but the content that is delivered is the same. By default, Akamai uses the query function's arguments to generate the cache key, and therefore, to generate a unique Cache Key for each user. This method is not optimal because it causes the Edge server to contact the origin server for content that is already cached, but that uses a different cache key. You can use the Cache Key Optimization feature to specify which query args to include or ignore when generating a Cache Key. This feature applies to any create or update of a CDN-Mapping configuration, as well as any create or update of an origin path.\n\nYou can configure the value of Cache Key Optimization from the Settings tab after creation of a CDN mapping.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"}]}

Unlike Discovery Query Language queries, with natural language queries you cannot specify which fields from the document you care about or how much significance to give to each one. When you teach Discovery with examples, the service figures out for you how much weight to give to each field.\n\nDiscovery builds a model that assigns different weights to term, bigram, and skip-gram matches for each of the root-level fields and balances them against matches from all of the other document fields. With enough examples, Discovery can return better answers because it knows where the best answers are typically stored.\n\nRelevancy training cannot be used to give more weight to nested fields. Nested fields are grouped and assigned one overall score. No matter how much you train, Discovery never gives a nested field more weight than it gives to a root-level field.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings.

If you want to find out more about the Vulnerability Advisor dashboard, see [Reviewing a vulnerability report](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexva_reviewing).\n\nEncrypted images aren't scanned by Vulnerability Advisor.\n\n\n\n Data protection \n\nTo scan images and containers in your account for security issues, Vulnerability Advisor collects, stores, and processes the following information:\n\n\n\n* Free-form fields, including IDs, descriptions, and image names (registry, namespace, repository name, and image tag)\n* Metadata about the file modes and creation timestamps of the configuration files\n* The content of system and application configuration files in images and containers\n* Installed packages and libraries (including their versions)\n\n\n\nDo not put personal information into any field or location that Vulnerability Advisor processes, as identified in the preceding list.\n\nScan results, aggregated at a data center level, are processed to produce anonymized metrics to operate and improve the service. In version 3, a vulnerability report (scan result) is generated when the image is pushed to the registry (and is regenerated regularly thereafter). When Vulnerability Advisor is queried, a scan result is retrieved that might be up to 5 days old. Scan results are deleted 30 days after they are generated.\n\nIn version 4, the image is indexed when it is first pushed to Container Registry registry, and that index report is stored in the database.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-4-2366", "score": 35.74146097124232, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

Optionally, you can specify resource groups and tags for your image.\n\nThe custom image that you create is regional, based on the location of the original boot volume. All custom images are private to the account in which they are created and labeled as custom.\n\nThe image also inherits the [encryption type](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpcifv-encryption). If the original volume used provider-managed encryption, you can keep that or you can specify customer-managed encryption and provide your own root keys. If the original volume used customer-managed encryption, the image inherits the root key. However, you can change that root key if you want to use another key.\n\nCustom images that are created from a volume are independent from the original volume. You can update the image and delete it as needed. You can delete the original volume and the custom image persists. Optionally specify resource groups and tags for your image.\n\n\n\n Requirements \n\nTo create an image from a volume, the volume must meet the following requirements:\n\n\n\n* The volume must be in the region where you want to create the custom image.\n* The volume must be a primary boot volume with 100 GB capacity. Data volumes are not supported.\n* The volume must be attached to an instance. Unattached boot volumes are not supported.\n* The instance must be in an available state.\n* The available, running instance must be stopped before you create the custom image.

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced.

Depending on the access permissions granted to users when you created the guidelines, human annotators and workspace administrators might be able to update the guidelines after opening them, for example, to add clarifications and examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotation guidelines \n\nThere is no prescribed format for how to document the guidelines, but it is important that the guidelines include detailed examples. Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00882-2700-4149", "score": 39.395840083798326, "text": "\nibmcloud doi testrecord-publish --logicalappname \"$MY_APP_NAME\" --buildnumber \"$MY_BUILD_NUMBER\" --filelocation \"./Report-final.xml\" --type staticsecurityscan\n\nChange the type to dynamicsecurityscan if the report is from a dynamic scan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Uploading SonarQube results \n\nTo upload data from SonarQube, you must provide the SonarQube server token by using --token.

For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload. Priority classes can help you control the Red Hat OpenShift controller decisions to favor higher priority pods over lower priority pods. The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs). Access policies and SCCs can help prevent untrusted users from deploying high priority pods that prevent other pods from scheduling.\n\nHow does priority scheduling and preemption work?\n\nIn general, pending pods that have a higher priority are scheduled before lower prioritized pods. If you don't have enough resources remaining in your worker nodes, the Red Hat OpenShift controller can preempt (remove) pods to free up enough resources for the higher prioritized pods to be scheduled.

Such words are referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The service adds OOV words to the custom model's words resource. The purpose of the words resource is to define words that are not already present in the service's vocabulary.\n\nDefinitions in the words resource tell the service how to transcribe the OOV words. The information includes a sounds_like field that tells the service how the word is pronounced, a display_as field that tells the service how to display the word, and a source field that indicates how the word was added to the custom model.

Not all grammars have OOV words, but verifying the words resource is generally a good idea. To check the words of the custom model after you add a grammar, use the following methods:\n\n\n\n* Use the GET /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words method to list all of the words from a custom model.

Also look for typographical and other errors in the words themselves.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

For example, you send messages to two platforms (iOS and Android) and you create a subscription that has 100 phone numbers. The subscription topic received 1000 events during the month:\n\nDestination instances: 2\n\nConsumption:\n\nTotal Outbound Digital messages = (number of phone numbers) x (topic events)\n\nIn the example, the total outbound digital messages are:\n\n100 x 1000 = 100000 outbound digital messages\n\nYou are charged for messages that are successfully sent by the IBM Cloud push service to the push provider regardless of whether the message was successfully delivered to the local device. So vet your device list carefully to prevent unnecessary charges.\n\nYou can monitor your push usage by setting up a monitoring dashboard through the Actions menu in the Event Notifications dashboard. For more information, see [Monitor Event Notifications service metrics with IBM Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-monitoring).\n\n\n\n Push charges for pre-production destination \n\nThe IBM Cloud push service has two components to pricing: a destination instance fee and a consumption price.\n\nA pre-production destination instance fee is charged monthly. Every pre-production destination added to your Event Notifications instance incurs the fee.\n\nConsumption: Only 500 devices or 5000 outbound digital messages is permitted per pre-production destination. If either the number of devices or the number of outbound digital messages exceeds the permitted limit, the permitted number of devices is moved by additional 500 devices or by additional 5000 messages and charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-push"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14546-4405-6573", "score": 22.336646275690196, "text": "\nThis value includes public outbound traffic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n VMware Shared Solutions Reserved billing plan \n\nVMware Shared Solutions Reserved virtual data center resources are preallocated and guaranteed.

If you need to find document conflicts, use the following example map function:\n\nfunction (doc) {\nif (doc._conflicts) {\nemit(null, [doc._rev].concat(doc._conflicts));\n}\n}\n\nIf you want to find conflicts within multiple documents in a database, write a [view](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-views-mapreduce).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't check for conflicts, or don't fix them, your IBM Cloudant database has the following problems:\n\n\n\n* Document inconsistency increases because conflicting documents continue to multiply.\n* Database size increases because documents with conflicts must be kept until the conflict is resolved.\n* Performance degrades because it takes more work for IBM Cloudant to respond to each request since it has to go through all the conflicted documents to find the \"best possible\" version.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00472-4578-6166", "score": 14.183931132181312, "text": "\nContent that is indexed with a boost value greater than 1 is more relevant than content that is indexed without a boost value.

The JavaScript activation is asynchronous if the main function exits by returning a promise. In this case, the system assumes that the action is still running until the promise is fulfilled or rejected. JavaScript functions that run asynchronously can return the activation result after the main function returns by returning a promise in your action.\n\nStart by instantiating a new promise object and passing a callback function. The callback takes two arguments, resolve and reject, which are both functions. All your asynchronous code goes inside that callback. The action handler can have any name that conforms to the conventional signature of accepting an object and returning an object (or a Promise of an object).\n\nIn the following example, you can see how to fulfill a promise by calling the resolve function.\n\nfunction main(args) {\nreturn new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\nsetTimeout(function() {\nresolve({ done: true });\n}, 2000);\n})\n}\n\nThis example shows how to reject a promise by calling the reject function.\n\nfunction main(args) {\nreturn new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\nsetTimeout(function() {\nreject({ done: true });\n}, 2000);\n})\n}\n\nIn the examples, the following details are executed.\n\n\n\n* The main function returns a promise. The promise indicates that the activation isn't completed yet but is expected to in the future.\n* The setTimeout() JavaScript function waits for 2 seconds before it calls the promise's callback function, which represents the asynchronous code.\n* The promise's callback accepts the arguments resolve and reject, which are both functions.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prep"}]}

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more.

Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics.

When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07067-26099-28206", "score": 13.305914496840167, "text": "\nIf false, ranks the passages from all of the documents by passage quality regardless of the document quality and returns them in a separate passages field in the response.\n* When passages are returned for a query, you can also enable answer finding.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation.

Or, if you prefer, you can connect the assistant to your existing infrastructure by configuring an existing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk.\n\nA SIP trunk is equivalent to an analog telephone line, except it uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to transmit voice data and can support multiple concurrent calls. The trunk can connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or your company's on-premises private branch exchange (PBX). If you choose to generate a free phone number for your assistant, a SIP trunk is automatically provisioned from IntelePeer. You can also choose to use an existing SIP trunk from a provider such as IntelePeer, Genesys, or Twilio.\n\nGenerating a free phone number is available only with new phone integrations. If you have an existing phone integration and you want to switch to a free phone number, you must delete the existing integration and create a new one.\n\nWhen your customer makes a phone call using the telephone number connected to your assistant, the phone integration answers. The integration converts output from your assistant into voice audio by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service. The audio is sent to the telephone network through the SIP trunk. When the customer replies, the voice input is converted into text by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service.\n\nThis feature is available only to Plus or Enterprise plan users.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phone"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03158-2940-4987", "score": 19.96159851093908, "text": "\nIn the Integrations section on the main page for your assistant, click Add integration.\n2.

If you are using [multiple environments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-multiple-environments), instances of the channel are added to your extra environments.

For more information about adding integrations to your assistant, see [Adding integrations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-integration-add).\n\nAlthough a channel always exists in environments, you can configure your integration separately in each environment. For example, this allows you to test integrations on your draft environment before you go live with any integration configuration. After you add an integration, you must set it up to use it with your assistant. The Finish setup icon appears on any integration that you added but didn't yet set up.\n\nYou have multiple options for deploying your assistant, depending on how you want your customers to interact with it.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.  In the Query workspace page, enter the query and click Run on starter to get the results.\n2.  Click Explain on the screen to visualize the graphical representation of the query.\n\n\n\nOn the Explain window, click a stage to view the details on the right window.

The IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM) service in IBM Cloud generates events that you can use to monitor log in activity to your account. This tutorial explains the different log in options to IBM Cloud and what happens from an IAM and an IBM Cloud Activity Tracker perspective. You can also find out how to define views and dashboards to monitor these actions in your account.\n\nTo work in the IBM Cloud, a user, an application, or a service must log in to IBM Cloud. The user, application, or service needs valid credentials to access an account and run actions on services in that account.\n\nAs a user, you can log in to the IBM Cloud in any of the following ways:\n\n\n\n* Log in through the IBM Cloud UI\n* Log in from the command-line interface (CLI) by using an API key\n* Log in from the command-line interface (CLI) by using a one-time passcode\n* Log in from the command-line interface (CLI) by using a user ID and password\n\n\n\nAs a service, you log in to the IBM Cloud by using an API key that is associated to a service ID.\n\nIf you are a new user of the IBM Cloud, [you must request an IBMid](https://cloud.ibm.com/login). When you register to work in the IBM Cloud, you get an IBMid, and an account is created and associated to your IBMid.\n\nOnce you have registered to IBM Cloud, you can be invited to be a member in other accounts in IBM Cloud. When you are invited to work in an account that is different from the default account that is associated with your IBMid, an event with action user-management.user.create is generated and available in the account where you are invited to work.

An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running. You can develop and deploy Spark SQL, data transformation, data science, or machine learning jobs using the Spark application API.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the advantages of IBM Analytics Engine serverless instances? \n\nWith IBM Analytics Engine serverless, compute and memory resources are allocated on demand when Spark workloads are deployed. When an application is not in running state, no computing resources are allocated to the IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the instance, billed on a per second basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark support Hadoop? \n\nNo, currently, the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark only supports Apache Spark.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change the instance home storage of a serverless instance? \n\nNo, you can't. After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries. Changing instance home would result in the loss of the Spark history data and custom libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is user management and access control managed in a serverless instance? \n\nUser management and access control of an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance and its APIs is done through IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM). You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges. See [Granting permissions to users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I define the size of the cluster to run my Spark application? \n\nYou can specify the size of the cluster either at the time the instance is created or when submitting Spark applications.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-faqs-serverless"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-107943-110247", "score": 18.062634717838428, "text": "\n* Port 8443 Knox\n* Port 22 SSH\n* Port 9443 Ambari\n\n\n\n* What is IBM Analytics Engine serverless?\n\nThe IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark offers a new consumption model using Apache Spark.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 27.56998170710024, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 24.03308739625832, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04170-1738-2974", "score": 22.866861271023176, "text": "\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls.

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing many compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like a traffic jam clogging up a highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n How DDoS attacks work \n\nAn attacker gains control of a network of online machines to carry out a DDoS attack. Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-323776-325852", "score": 27.83425245610389, "text": "\nA script and tool will assist you to simulate the transmission of web server log messages from a static file to Event Streams.\n\nObject Storage Event Streams\n\n+3\n\nAnalytics Engine,Data Engine,Key Protect\n\n\n\n* 3 hours\n* 2023-05-05\n\n\n\n[Enhance cloud security by applying context-based restrictions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-cbr-enhanced-security)Enhance cloud security by applying context-based restrictions\n\nThis tutorial walks you through the process of implementing context-based restrictions (CBRs) in your IBM Cloud account.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 22.439874944564654, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 22.3383281176868, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic.

Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests.

For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires.

Typically, worker node version updates are released every two weeks.\n: You might check for a version update to meet your required security cadence, such as updates on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.

Because the cluster masters run in your Satellite location control plane, make sure that you have enough extra hosts in your control plane before you update any hosts.

The purpose of the words resource is to define words that are not already present in the service's vocabulary.\n\nDefinitions in the words resource tell the service how to transcribe the OOV words.

The IBM Cloud Kubernetes service uses a tiered pricing model that is visible in IBM Cloud when you provision your paid cluster. This includes the charges for your compute, that is, CPU and memory. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Services are priced on a tiered model that is based on the number of hours of usage per month. Therefore, when you examine pricing plans, consider that 24x7 usage is equivalent to 720 hours per month. Refer to the table on the [Kubernetes Service Catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/about) for more details on cluster pricing. Customers who are interested in pricing OpenShift clusters can review [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Pricing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift/pricing).\n* Storage: Choose the storage plan that works for your needs.

Access to VPC Infrastructure Services can be controlled with context-based restrictions and identity and access management (IAM) policies.\n\nThese restrictions work with traditional IAM policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Unlike IAM policies, context-based restrictions don't assign access. Context-based restrictions check that an access request comes from an allowed context that you configure. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials. For more information, see [What are context-based restrictions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis).\n\nA user must have the Administrator role on the VPC Infrastructure Services to create, update, or delete rules that target VPC Infrastructure Services.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price.

With an enterprise, you can create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts by organizing related accounts into account groups. Enterprises simplify management of multiple accounts with the following key features:\n\n\n\n* Consolidated billing means that you can manage billing, invoicing, and payment for all accounts from a single place, the enterprise account.\n* Subscription credit is aggregated into a credit pool and shared with all accounts in the enterprise. Not only is tracking your subscriptions easier, but you can get fewer, larger subscriptions for a better discount because the credit is shared.\n* Top-down usage reporting gives you a unified view of usage costs from all accounts, organized according to your enterprise hierarchy.\n\n\n\nIf you have multiple accounts, at least one of which is a Subscription account, you can create an enterprise.

Credit cards identify an individual in terms of banking transactions, while Fabric identities allow users to be identified in a blockchain context.\n\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, as well as the IBM Blockchain Platform, this component is the Certificate Authority (CA), which creates identities in the form of x509 certificates as well defining of an organization through the creation of a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines the permissions of identities at a component and channel level. These identities can include attributes about them, for example, by linking them to a particular organization or organizational unit (OU).\n\nAn organization MSP, for example, has an MSP subfolder called admins. Any user whose certificate is inside that admin folder is an admin of the organization. Because this MSP defines the organization, it is listed in the configuration on every channel of which the organization is a member. As a result, whenever an admin of the organization tries to perform an action, the signing certificate of the admin (which is attached to all of its interactions) is checked against the certificates listed in the MSP. Does the certificate match the one listed in the channel configuration? If it does, the other organizations will validate it and the action can be performed. If not, the request to execute the transaction is rejected.\n\nIBM Blockchain Platform CAs are based on the [Hyperledger Fabric CA](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/), though it is possible to use another CA if it uses a PKI based on x.509 certificates. Because non-Fabric CAs are not configured to create properly formatted MSPs, users who want to use this kind of CA must create the MSP for themselves.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-blockchain-component-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09192-7-1931", "score": 32.49999302250501, "text": "\nTroubleshooting \n\nGeneral problems with using IBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae might include providing the correct headers or credentials when you interact with the API.

Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

You can use the /dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the /dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02953-12940-14393", "score": 16.47809247166891, "text": "\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\nYou can see the number of dialog nodes in a dialog skill from the assistant tile. If the skill is not associated with an assistant already, add the dialog skill to an assistant, and then view the skill tile from the main page of the assistant. The trained data section lists the number of dialog nodes.\n\nIf the total seems larger than you expected, it might be because the dialog that you build from the application is translated into a JSON object. Some fields that appear to be part of a single node are actually structured as separate dialog nodes in the underlying JSON object.\n\n\n\n* Each node and folder is represented as its own node.\n* Each conditional response that is associated with a single dialog node is represented as an individual node.\n* For a node with slots, each slot, slot found response, slot not found response, slot handler, and if set, the prompt for everything response is an individual node. In effect, one node with three slots might be equivalent to eleven dialog nodes.\n\n\n\nPrevious topic:[Controlling the dialog flow](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime)\n\nNext topic:[Dialog building tips](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tips)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tasks"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02882-33778-35796", "score": 16.43143596782395, "text": "\nFor example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated before the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately. That is, the system does not evaluate the condition of the selected dialog node; it processes the response of the selected dialog node immediately.\n\nTargeting the response is useful for chaining several dialog nodes together. The response is processed as if the condition of this dialog node is true. If the selected dialog node has another Jump to action, that action is run immediately, too.\n* Wait for user input: Waits for new input from the user, and then begins to process it from the node that you jump to. This option is useful if the source node asks a question, for example, and you want to jump to a separate node to process the user's answer to the question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\n\n\n* Be sure to test your dialog as you build it.

Remove these system entities from your dialog.\n* If you receive a message that says the skill contains artifacts that exceed the limits imposed by your service plan, complete the following steps to upload the skill successfully:\n\n\n\n1. Purchase a plan with higher artifact limits.\n2. Create a service instance in the new plan.\n3. Upload the skill to the new service instance.\n4. If you don't want to keep the higher-level plan, make edits to the skill such that it meets the artifact limit requirements for the plan you want to use going forward.\n\n\n\nFor information about how to decrease the number of dialog nodes, see [How many nodes are in my dialog?](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasksdialog-tasks-count-nodes).\n\n\n\n1. Download the edited skill to export it.\n2. Try again to upload the edited skill into the original service instance on the plan you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding the skill to an assistant \n\nYou can add one dialog skill to an assistant. You must open the assistant tile and add the skill to the assistant from the assistant configuration page; you cannot choose the assistant that will use the skill from within the skill configuration page.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application. For example, if the source document contains the sentence Murder on the Orient Express made headlines, then how you define entity types to capture the key information in the sentence differs depending on the type of application that will use the model that you build with the type system.\n\n\n\n* For a literary application, you might create types that capture this information:\n\n[NOVEL] [CRITICAL_RECEPTION]\n\n[Murder on the Orient Express] [made headlines]\n* For a public safety application, you might create these types:\n\n[EVENT_CRIME] [LOCATION]\n\n[Murder] on the [Orient Express] made headlines\n\n\n\nThe structure is often driven by characteristics of the documents from which information will be extracted, but should always be tempered by what information the application will actually use from those documents. For example, you might be creating an application that gains insights from medical records. To build the type system, you start looking at patient records to see what kinds of information must be captured. The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system. And in making the decision to make this omission, recognize that this means that sections of your patient record documents will be left unannotated. That is alright and even expected.\n\nMentions annotate a span of text; they do not replace the text. A type system is not an ontology for a domain. Expect to have general entity types such as MEDICATION_NAME instead of having an entity type for each medicine type. The document text will continue to contain the specific medicine name.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03118-1768-3298", "score": 28.26633699118819, "text": "\n(Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy /message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

If you use the v1 /message method, you must implement your own state management, and you cannot take advantage of versioning or any of the other features of an assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Authoring applications \n\nThe v1 API provides methods that enable an application to create or modify dialog skills, as an alternative to building a skill graphically using the Watson Assistant user interface. An authoring application uses the API to create and modify skills, intents, entities, dialog nodes, and other artifacts that make up a dialog skill. For more information, see the [v1 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1).\n\nNote: The v1 authoring methods create and modify workspaces rather than skills.

For example, fuzzy matching may match the term unsure with insurance; but if you have unsure defined as a value/synonym for an entity like @option, then unsure will always be matched to @option, and not to insurance.\n\nYour fuzzy matching setting has no impact on synonym recommendations. Even if fuzzy matching is enabled, synonyms are suggested for the exact value you specify only, not the value and slight variations of the value.\n\nTo understand how fuzzy matching and autocorrection are related to one another, see the [autocorrection documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-spell-checkdialog-runtime-spell-check-vs-fuzzy-matching).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding contextual entities \n\nIf you are using version 1.3 of the product, see [Adding contextual entities in v1.3](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-entitiesentities-create-annotation-based-v130) instead. The way you annotate entity mentions changed between releases.\n\nAnnotation-based entites are those for which you annotate occurrences of the entity in sample sentences to teach your assistant about the context in which the entity is typically used.\n\nIn order to train a contextual entity model, you can take advantage of your intent examples, which provide readily-available sentences to annotate.\n\nThis feature is generally available in English-language dialog skills and is available as a beta feature in French-langage dialog skills. For more information about language support, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support).\n\nUsing an intent's user examples to define contextual entities does not affect the classification of that intent. However, entity mentions that you label are also added to that entity as synonyms.

By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy /message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another.

When specified in combination with PARTITIONED INTO, the same is done, which is often referred to as clustering the rows by the specified columns into the fixed number of partitions specified by PARTITIONED INTO. When specified without the PARTITIONED clause, it is equivalent to an ORDER BY clause specified at the top level of the SQL SELECT statement. If PARTITIONED INTO is specified, the ORDER BY clause is ignored.\n\n\n\n Partition by columns \n\nWhen you use the PARTITIONED BY (column-list) clause without specifying INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS, you can store the query result by using Hive-style partitioning, which is to create partitions that contain only rows that have certain values for one or more columns. Choose this physical layout if the stored object is further analyzed by using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.\n\nFor example, a result object that contains worldwide order data has a column country to represent the country that the order is initiated from. Partitioning the result object by the column PARTITIONED BY (country), would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.\n\nWhen the result object is stored this way on Cloud Object Storage, each SQL query that contains a predicate, such as country = 'USA' or country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY'), benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during SQL query execution partitions must be read only if they contain data for the countries of interest. This layout tremendously cuts down the I/O traffic of the SQL query.\n\nSee the following extra remarks on Hive-style partitioning.\n\n\n\n* Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme because the column names that are used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, /order/COUNTRY=USA/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet.\n* Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are stored in the object prefix of the partition.

This statement removes the table definition from the catalog without affecting the actual data on Object Storage:\n\nDROP TABLE customers\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned tables \n\nYou can manage a table in the catalog that references data that is organized in multiple partitions on Object Storage.

The column must be a column name that is included in the schema definition of the CREATE TABLE statement. You can also have more than one partitioning columns in the object names, such as /columm1=value/column2=value/.\n\nFollowing is an example list of object names on Object Storage that is partitioned on the country column with the Hive-style partition naming convention:\n\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=Germany/cust-1.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=Germany/cust-2.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=Spain/cust-1.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=Austria/cust-1.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=Austria/cust-2.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=USA/cust-1.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=USA/cust-2.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=USA/cust-3.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=Sweden/cust-1.csv\n\nTo query partitioned tables, you must perform two mandatory steps:\n\n\n\n Step 1: Register the table", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13480-6528-8270", "score": 16.208403296931465, "text": "\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=USA/cust-1.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=USA/cust-2.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=USA/cust-3.csv\ncustomers_partitioned.csv/country=Sweden/cust-1.csv\n\nTo query partitioned tables, you must perform two mandatory steps:\n\n\n\n Step 1: Register the table \n\nThis data partitioning is reflected in the PARTITIONED BY clause of the following CREATE TABLE statement:\n\nCREATE TABLE customers (\ncustomerID string,\ncompanyName string,\ncontactName string,\ncontactTitle string,\naddress string,\nregion string,\npostalCode string,\ncountry string,\nphone string,\nfax string\n)\nUSING CSV\nPARTITIONED BY (country)\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/customers_partitioned.csv\n\nAutomatic schema detection also recognizes partitioned tables from the structure of the object names, so the same table definition is created from the following statement:\n\nCREATE TABLE customers\nUSING CSV\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/customers_partitioned.csv\n\nIf your data on Object Storage does not adhere to this naming convention, you can convert it to a Hive-partitioned layout by using Data Engine in a data preparation step.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16242-1610-3614", "score": 22.914953156945415, "text": "\nFor example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

If two actions have similar phrase examples, then the wrong action might get triggered by your user's question.\n\n\n\n Confidence scoring \n\nBehind the scenes, Watson Assistant determines a confidence score for each phrase.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it.

JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small.

In this network-attached storage (NAS) environment, you have total control over your file shares function and performance. File Storage for Classic shares can be connected to up to 64 authorized devices over routed TCP/IP connections for resiliency.\n\nFor more information about using File Storage for Classic with the IBM Cloud\u00ae Kubernetes Service, see [Storing data on classic IBM Cloud File Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nFile Storage for Classic volumes can be provisioned from 20 GB to 12 TB with two options:\n\n\n\n* Provision Endurance tiers that feature pre-defined performance levels and other features like snapshots and replication.\n* Build a high-powered Performance environment with allocated input/output operations per second (IOPS).\n\n\n\nFor more information about the File Storage for Classic offering, see [What is IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/products/file-storage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Provisioning considerations \n\n\n\n Block size \n\nThe IOPS value for both Endurance and Performance is based on a 16-KB block size with a 50/50 read and write, 50/50 random and sequential workload. A 16-KB block is the equivalent of one write to the volume.\n\nThe block size that is used by your application directly impacts the storage performance.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00522-7-1725", "score": 18.411069751398355, "text": "\nDigging deeper into IBM Cloudant Dashboard \n\nThe IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Dashboard gives new and experienced IBM Cloudant users the opportunity to add, edit, and delete documents.

Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3.

But in some cases, a request might see a response with thousands of changes replayed - potentially all of the changes from the beginning of time. The potential for rewinds makes the changes feed unsuitable for an application that expects queue-like behavior.\n\nTo reiterate, IBM Cloudant's changes feed promises to deliver a document at least one time in a changes feed, and gives no guarantees about repeated values across multiple requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the changes feed operate in \"real time\"? \n\nThe changes feed doesn't guarantee how quickly an incoming change appears to a client that consumes the changes feed. Applications must not be developed with the assumption that data inserts, updates, and deletes are immediately propagated to a changes reader.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why don't all individual document changes appear in the changes feed? \n\nIf a document is updated several times in between changes feed calls, then the changes feed might reflect only the most recent of these changes.

It must not be used as a means of running operational queries against a database. Filtered changes are slow (the filter is applied to every changed document in turn, without the help of an index).

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style.

Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Adding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03353-5263-7331", "score": 27.595757628978845, "text": "\nItalian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English. All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing a skill language \n\nOnce a skill has been created, its language cannot be modified. If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1. From your skill tile, click the Actions drop-down menu, and then select Language Preferences.\n\nThis option is only available for skills that are configured to use a bidirectional language.\n2.

Without relevancy training, a standard mechanism is used to determine relevance based on common factors. When you train a relevancy model, you help Discovery to use features that are unique to your documents as it determines relevance.\n\nThe relevancy training model that is associated with a project is used at run time only when natural language queries are submitted. The model is not applied to Discovery Query Language (DQL) queries.\n\nYou cannot apply relevancy training to Content Mining project types.\n\nTo train a relevancy model, you provide sample natural language queries, submit them to get results from your documents, and then rate those results. As you add more examples, the information you provide about result relevance for each query is used to learn about your project. The system uses your assessments to assign importance to different types of structural information within the documents. For example, it learns the importance of when a keyword from the search query appears in the title versus the header, body, or in the metadata of the document. It also learns from the importance of the distance between one matching keyword and another. After a successful relevancy training session, a ranker model is created.

The short-form model is trained to recognize the short utterances that are frequently expressed in customer support settings like automated support call centers. In addition to being tuned for short utterances in general, the model is also tuned for precise utterances such as digits, single-character word and name spellings, and yes-no responses.\n\nThe en-US_ShortForm_NarrowbandModel is optimal for the kinds of responses that are common to human-to-machine exchanges, such as the use case of IBM\u00ae Voice Agent with Watson\u2122. The en-US_NarrowbandModel is generally optimal for human-to-human conversations. However, depending on the use case and the nature of the exchange, some users might find the short-form model suitable for human-to-human conversations as well. Given this flexibility and overlap, you might experiment with both models to determine which works best for your application. In either case, applying a custom language model with a grammar to the short-form model can further improve recognition results.\n\nAs with all models, noisy environments can adversely impact the results. For example, background acoustic noise from airports, moving vehicles, conference rooms, and multiple speakers can reduce transcription accuracy. Audio from speaker phones can also reduce accuracy due to the echo common to such devices. Using the parameters available for speech activity detection can counteract such effects and help improve speech transcription accuracy. Applying a custom acoustic model can further fine-tune the acoustics for speech recognition, but only as a final measure.\n\n\n\n* For more information about language model and acoustic model customization, see [Understanding customization](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-customization).\n* For more information about grammars, see [Using grammars with custom language models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammars).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-169150-171163", "score": 30.75267129166117, "text": "\n* When you create a dialog, two nodes are now added to it for you: 1) a Welcome node at the start the dialog tree that contains the greeting to display to the user and 2) an Anything else node at the end of the tree that catches any user inquiries that are not recognized by other nodes in the dialog and responds to them.

For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03367-4-2117", "score": 29.05857302983719, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

Diverse dark fiber providers are used to connect every edge site to all of the regional compute facilities.

If your active cluster becomes unavailable, Portworx automatically fails over to the standby cluster and makes the standby cluster the new active cluster so that data can continue to be accessed.\n\nIf you installed Portworx in one of your clusters without the Portworx disaster recovery plan, you must re-install Portworx with the disaster recovery plan so that you can include this cluster in your disaster recovery configuration.\n\nDepending on your cluster setup, Portworx offers the following two disaster recovery configurations:\n\n\n\n* [Metro DR](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/disaster-recovery/1-metro-dr-nodes-are-in-the-metro-area-network-man): Your Kubernetes clusters are in the same metro location, such as both clusters are deployed in one or multiple zones of the us-south region. All clusters are configured to use the same Portworx cluster and share the same Portworx key-value store. Data is automatically replicated between the clusters because the Portworx storage layer is shared. RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for this configuration is less than 60 seconds.\n* [Asynchronous DR](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/disaster-recovery/2-asynchronous-dr-nodes-are-across-different-regions-datacenters): Your Kubernetes clusters are deployed in different regions, such as us-south and us-east.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_portworx_recovery"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14598-9419-11893", "score": 23.29018311066681, "text": "\nResponsibilities for security and regulation compliance for VMware Solutions offerings (other than VMware Shared)\nThe rows are read from left to right.

It's also worth checking to see if any IPs in these ranges are blocked.\n\n522 errors can also be caused by network connectivity issues, so confirm that your server and network is generally healthy and not overloaded.\n\nIf after taking the above steps you still receive errors, contact IBM CIS support and confirm the following:\n\n\n\n* You've allowlisted our IP ranges\n* Your server/network is online and generally healthy\n\n\n\nIf you contact our support team, please provide a Ray ID from a recent 522 error.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14311-2669-4435", "score": 23.12095453210237, "text": "\nIf you use the existing workload edge cluster, you must create the edge bridge profile by using that cluster and change the existing-distributed port group to allow Promiscuous mode and Forged transmits.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel). When the traffic is split between the VPN interface and other interfaces, split tunneling is said to be in use.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-vpn-planning"}]}

The certificate also shows the expiration date and details of the issuing Certificate Authority (CA).\n* How Does TLS Work?\n\nWhen a browser initiates a connection with a TLS secured website, it first retrieves the site's TLS Certificate to check whether the certificate is still valid.

If any of these checks fail, you'll get a warning indicating that the website is not secured by a valid certificate.\n\nWhen a TLS certificate is installed on a web server, it enables a secure connection between the web server and the browser that connects to it.

Users must add explicit drop rules if the default behavior is not desired.\n\nThe VRA provides a basic CPP rule set as template. You can merge it into your configuration by running:\n\nvyatta@vrouter merge /opt/vyatta/etc/cpp.conf\n\nAfter this rule set is merged, a new firewall rule set named CPP is added and applied to the loopback interface.

In zone-based firewall operation an interface is assigned to a zone (only one zone per interface) and firewall rule sets are assigned to the boundaries between zones with the idea that all interfaces within a zone have the same security level and are allowed to route freely. Traffic is only scrutinized when it is passing from one zone to another. Zones drop any traffic coming into them which is not explicitly allowed.\n\nAn interface can either belong to a zone or have a per-interface firewall configuration; an interface cannot do both.\n\nImagine the following office scenario with three departments, each department with its own VLAN:\n\n\n\n* Department A - VLANs 10 and 20 (interface dp0bond1.10 and dp0bond1.20)\n* Department B - VLANs 30 and 40 (interface dp0bond1.30 and dp0bond1.40)\n* Department C - VLAN 50 (interface dp0bond1.50)\n\n\n\nA zone can be created for each department and the interfaces for that department can be added to the zone.

If a type consistently causes confusion, then you might need to rename it or eliminate it if it is redundant.\n* An existing type is never used by human annotators because it is never referenced in the documents. If the type is unlikely to ever be used in literature from this domain, then remove it from the type system.\n* Two types are often interchanged when human annotators annotate documents. Consider whether the two types could be consolidated into one type that accurately represents the concept or relationship. For example, if the type system contains both PERSON and PEOPLE, which are often used interchangeably, it might be best to use one type named PERSONPEOPLE that covers both cases instead of two separate types.\n\n\n\nUse caution when you update the type system.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-ml"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16452-5472-7655", "score": 25.61430435209055, "text": "\n* Are multiple users or applications encountering the same type of problem?\n* Can the problem be re-created by running a single command, a set of commands, or a particular application?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cannot access the application \n\nFind out how to grant users access to Knowledge Studio, and address common access issues.\n\n\n\n Administrator \n\nEach Knowledge Studio instance has an administrator role associated with it.

First, you must register with IBM if you do not have IBM registration credentials already. Once you register with IBM and accept the invitation, you are given access to the instance. However, after you are given access and before you can start to annotate documents, the administrator or a project manager of the instance must add you to a workspace and assign an annotation task to you. It is not until after you have been assigned a task that you can perform any actions in the Knowledge Studio instance. To annotate documents, use the ground truth editor. Use a Google Chrome browser for the best performance.\n\nFor help using the ground truth editor, see [Annotating documents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-user-guide).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Experimental services and features: What does experimental mean? \n\nIBM releases experimental services and features for you to try out.

Use rules to capture patterns that occur in documents and convey information about underlying entity types.\n\n\n\n Class overview \n\nWhen you construct a rule, you use classes to represent types of information. These classes are similar to entity types. So, why don't we just use entity types when defining rules? Because as you build rules, you can define intermediate classes that are used only to build other more complex classes. These intermediate classes are solely utilitarian. They are not useful on their own. Intermediate classes work with other intermediate classes to define a more useful and complete class. An intermediate class is necessary, but not something you expose as part of a type system. To enable the rule-based model to do useful things like pre-annotate documents with entity mentions, you must map the complex classes that you use during rule creation to their equivalent entity types from the type system.\n\nFor example, you want a model that can recognize people's names. To train a machine learning model to recognize people's names, you would annotate many different names that are written in a variety of formats in documents in an annotation set with the PERSON entity type, and train a model to recognize people's names. To create a rule-based model to recognize people's names, you define a rule that describes the text patterns used to write people's names. So, you might create a FirstName class and a LastName class and use these intermediate classes to define a FullName class. You might define conditions that determine the placement of the FullName class in relation to common prefixes, such as Dr. and common suffixes, such as Jr.. When the rule-based model is used, the FullName class is mapped to the PERSON entity type.\n\nAnother reason to avoid mapping intermediate classes to entities in your type system is that if you pre-annotate documents with the rule-based model, and then add them to your ground truth for training a machine learning model, you do not want to define rules in such a way that they will produce overlapping entity mentions.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-rule-annotator"}]}

This includes the vSRX 18.4 1G SR-IOV offering. The older vSRX 18.4 1G Standard offering is based on Linux Bridging and has different network configurations on the Ubuntu host, the KVM hypervisor, and in the vSRX configuration. The host and KVM settings do not require any special migration steps, as the automation process handles the configuration changes. However, if you want to import the vSRX configuration from the legacy architecture into the current vSRX configuration, you likely need to refactor some of the configuration.\n\n\n\n Migrating 1G vSRX standalone configurations \n\nThere are some steps you potentially need to convert vSRX configuration settings on a Standalone 18.4 1G Public+Private Linux Bridge (legacy architecture) instance to a Standalone 18.4 1G Public+Private SR-IOV (current architecture) instance.\n\nYou can find a sample default configuration for SR-IOV based current architecture [in this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-understanding-the-vsrx-default-configurationdefault-configuration-of-a-sample-standalone-vsrx-gateway).\n\nThe following is a sample default configuration for the Linux Bridge (legacy architecture). The example shows vSRX instances that were provisioned in different Datacenter pods. As a result, the transit VLAN\u2019s (native-vlan-id) are different.\n\n Last commit: 2020-04-16 22:48:33 UTC by root\nversion 18.4R1-S1.3;\nsystem {\nlogin {\nclass security {\npermissions [ security-control view-configuration ];\n}\nuser admin {\nuid 2000;\nclass super-user;\nauthentication {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-migrating-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03350-4-2142", "score": 21.632843872933975, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

This enhanced model helps your skill recognize irrelevant inputs earlier in the development process.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of the new algorithm, read the [Why Zero-Effort Irrelevance is Relevant](https://medium.com/ibm-watson/enhanced-offtopic-90b2dadf0ef1) blog post.\n\nThe new algorithm is enabled automatically for any English-language skills that you import or create.\n\nTo test the new detection mechanism in the Try it out pane, submit one or more utterances that have absolutely nothing to do with your training data.

For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16159-7-1863", "score": 18.993316656270324, "text": "\nKnown limitations for IBM Cloud Juniper vSRX \n\nThere are some limitations to be aware of when using IBM Cloud\u00ae Juniper vSRX.\n\n\n\n* Due to incompatible networking elements, the Juniper vSRX solution is not available as follows:\n\n\n\n* 10 Gbps version in WDC01\n* 1G and 10G High Availability versions in: DAL05, SJC01, and WDC01\n\n\n\n* Only IBM Cloud certified versions of vSRX are supported.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16299-7-2120", "score": 26.350709839009937, "text": "\nOverview: Customizing and developing \n\nThe Watson Assistant user interface makes it easy to build an assistant and deploy it to your customers without writing any code.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"></div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using.

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced. Changes that you make in one area must be evaluated and coordinated with changes that you make in another area. For example, if you add an entity type, review the guidelines for annotating relation types and specify how the new entity type can relate to other entity types.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotation guidelines example \n\nMost annotation guidelines will need a lot of detail and examples to ensure that human annotators consistently annotate text.\n\nThe example presented here is a simple guideline that was created for a small domain that contains traffic incident reports.\n\n\n\n Task Goals \n\n\n\n* As project members, become familiar with the iterative process of manual annotation and machine learning model refinement.\n* Annotate documents in the automotive domain with the ground truth editor and use the annotations to train a machine learning model.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documents"}]}

This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.  In the Query workspace page, enter the query and click Run on starter to get the results.\n2.

The specific choice of which workload goes into each grouping is defined by the user. \"Resource groups\" are an IBM Cloud concept, while \"projects\" are Code Engine specific.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16267-2886-4844", "score": 13.720640023872537, "text": "\n* Words containing special characters, such as hyphens (-), asterisks (*), ampersands (&), or at signs (@), including those used in email addresses or URLs.\n* Words that belong, meaning words that have implied significance because they occur in your action steps or dialog entity values, entity synonyms, or intent user examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is spelling autocorrection related to fuzzy matching? \n\nIn dialog, fuzzy matching helps your assistant recognize dictionary-based entity mentions in user input. It uses a dictionary lookup approach to match a word from the user input to an existing entity value or synonym in the skill's training data. For example, if the user enters boook, and your training data contains a @reading_material entity with a book value, then fuzzy matching recognizes that the two terms (boook and book) mean the same thing.\n\nIn dialog, when you enable both autocorrection and fuzzy matching, the fuzzy matching function runs before autocorrection is triggered. If it finds a term that it can match to an existing dictionary entity value or synonym, it adds the term to the list of words that belong to the skill, and does not correct it.\n\nFor example, if a user enters a sentence like I wnt to buy a boook, fuzzy matching recognizes that the term boook means the same thing as your entity value book, and adds it to the protected words list. Your assistant corrects the input to be, I want to buy a boook. Notice that it corrects wnt but does not correct the spelling of boook. If you see this type of result when you are testing your dialog, you might think your assistant is misbehaving. However, your assistant is not. Thanks to fuzzy matching, it correctly identifies boook as a @reading_material entity mention. And thanks to autocorrection revising the term to want, your assistant is able to map the input to your buy_something intent.

Each feature does its part to help your assistant understand the meaning of the user input.\n\n\n\n\n\n How autocorrection works \n\nNormally, user input is saved as-is in the text field of the input object of the message. If, and only if the user input is corrected in some way, a new field is created in the input object, called original_text. This field stores the user's original input that includes any misspelled words in it. And the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected. Set the condition for the dialog node or conditional response that is asking for confirmation to original_text. This means that if the user's input was automatically corrected, show the corresponding response. And the response can contain the expression: You said: <?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-spell-check"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13878-17352-18831", "score": 13.405818462101003, "text": "\n* Tutorial: [Apply end to end security to a cloud application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-cloud-e2e-security)\n* Tutorial: [Best practices for organizing users, teams, applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-users-teams-applications)\n* Blog: [Cloud App Security: What Makes a Secure App?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/cloud-app-security)\n* Blog: [Onboarding Cloud Projects: Security and Resource Considerations](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/onboarding-cloud-projects-security-and-resource-considerations)\n* Blog: [Use Your FIDO2 Key for 2FA on IBM Cloud Apps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/use-your-fido2-key-for-2fa-on-ibm-cloud-apps)\n* Blog: [Going Passwordless on IBM Cloud Thanks to FIDO2](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/going-passwordless-on-ibm-cloud-thanks-to-fido2)\n* Blog: [IBM Cloud Security Hands-On: Share Your Chatbot Project](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/share-your-chatbot-project)\n* Blog: [Increase Information Security for Db2 on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/increase-information-security-for-db2-on-ibm-cloud)\n* IBM Architecture Center: [Security to safeguard and monitor your cloud apps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/securityArchitecture)\n* [IBM Cloud platform service CLIs and APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-platform-svc-cli-api)\n* [IBM Cloud Compliance Programs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-extended-app-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02718-4890-5645", "score": 13.32562295454032, "text": "\nSo we've got maybe [Writing] app one here, [Writing] app two, and say a [Writing] web page.\n\nWith a feature flagging service we can actually group these in collections so that we're a little bit more organized with which feature flags are tied to, which apps are web pages.\n\nSo now today we've learned about returning feature flags on and off without deployment testing directly in production, and then segmenting those features based on the user attributes.\n\nThank you for watching.

Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human.

If your application's lexicon includes such words, you can use the customization interface to specify how the service pronounces them.\n\nA custom model is a dictionary of words and their translations.

For example, a custom model that you create for the en-US language can be used with any US English voice.
