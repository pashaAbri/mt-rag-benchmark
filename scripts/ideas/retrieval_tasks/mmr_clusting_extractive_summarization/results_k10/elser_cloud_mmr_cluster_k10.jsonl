Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port.

You can also add more metrics by creating custom metrics and adding integrations.\n\n\n\n Metrics and labels \n\nA metric is a quantitative measure that has one or more labels to define its characteristics.\n\nUse metrics to analyze statistically data that has numerical values.\n\nA metric is represented by time series. A time-series is a unique combination of a metric name and label key-value pairs. For example: website_failedRequest |region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'. A data-point is the value generated for a time-series at a given point in time.\n\nLabels are classified as infrastructure labels and metric descriptor labels. Each metric has a set of pre-defined labels. For custom metrics, you can configure more labels.\n\nYou can use labels to identify and differentiate characteristics of a metric, for example,\n\n\n\n* You can group infrastructure objects into logical hierarchies.\n* You can filter out data.\n* You can split aggregated data into segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Collecting default metrics by using the Monitoring agent \n\nWhen you configure a Monitoring agent, data for default metrics is automatically collected.

The per-minute price of all audio that you recognize in a month is reduced once you reach the threshold of one million minutes of audio for that month. The price does not depend on how long the service takes to process the audio.

Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.\n* Am I charged for all audio that I send, even audio that does not include speech?\n\nYes, all audio that you send to the service contributes to your cumulative minutes of audio.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice.

It distributes objects across many availability zones within a single region. If a region or availability zone is inaccessible, the object store continues to function smoothly.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region.

Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04869-7924-8861", "score": 17.759727, "text": "\nYou can manage your keys manually by supplying your own encryption keys - referred to as Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).\n\n\n\n\n\n Archive rules \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage Archive is a low-cost option for data that is rarely accessed.

Starting 30 November 2017, the way that score is calculated changed. It is recommended that you only use the score value to rank documents in a single search, not across searches or sessions. If you trained a collection, a score value is returned in the results of a natural language query. Because the score indicates the relative relevancy between query results, it is not recommended tht it be used as a threshold. Instead, use the confidence, which indicates the relevance of the result as compared to the trained model, to set thresholds.

To use customization, users of the Lite plan must upgrade to a paid plan such as the Plus plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan? \n\nYou can upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan, for example, to gain access to customization. To upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan, use the Upgrade button in the resource catalog page for your service instance:\n\n\n\n* From the [resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources), click on your Speech to Text instance to go to the Speech to Text dashboard page.\n* From the Manage page, click Upgrade to move to the Plus plan.\n* Follow the steps on the Plan page to complete your upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What does \"pricing per minute\" mean? \n\nFor the Plus plan, pricing is based on the cumulative amount (number of minutes) of audio that you send to the service in any one month. The per-minute price of all audio that you recognize in a month is reduced once you reach the threshold of one million minutes of audio for that month. The price does not depend on how long the service takes to process the audio. (Per-minute pricing is different for the Standard plan.)\n\nFor information about pricing for the Plus and Standard plans, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Do you round up to the nearest minute for every call to the API? \n\nIBM does not round up the length of the audio for every API call that the service receives. Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12824-7-1978", "score": 16.086374, "text": "\nFAQs for migrated products \n\nFAQs about products that are migrated from the Resource Management Console might include questions about Lite plans, changing pricing plans, and brokers connected to approved pricing plans.\n\nTo find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see our [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n Why can't I add new block tier usage-based plans? \n\nBlock tier pricing plans are not currently supported in Partner Center.

You can use a service ID that you create to enable an application outside of IBM Cloud access to your services. You can assign specific access policies to the service ID that restrict permissions for using specific services, or even combine permissions for accessing different services. Since service IDs are not tied to a specific user, if a user happens to leave an organization and is deleted from the account, the service ID remains, ensuring that your application or service stays up and running.

Enter your company's domain, such as examplecorp.com.\n4. Review the information about the impact to your account, and select I understand the impact to my account. Then, click Create. The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3.

This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested.

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions.

Select your column type.\nThe data type restricts the type of data that can be stored in a column. For example, preventing entry of alphanumeric characters into a numeric field.\nData types also help sort data correctly and play a role in optimizing storage. For all these reasons, it is important to pick the appropriate data type.\n3. Specify whether Not null is true or false.\nA column that allows NULL values also allows rows to be inserted with no value in that column. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value.\n4. Specify the default value to be used if no value is specified when a row is inserted.\n5.

The next part is called Under the hood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Under the hood video \n\nLearn how the IBM Cloudant service is organized.\n\n\n\n* Under the hood video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 17 - Under the hood.\n\nLet's look at how an IBM Cloudant service is organized: This overview applies to the IBM Cloudant services that map to CouchDB 2 and 3. CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00646-3898-5632", "score": 21.781174, "text": "\nFor example, when your webpage is first loaded, it calls the GET /todolist endpoint. The GET /todolist endpoint uses the postFind method to query the database for all documents (by using the index created after the todo database), and then orders the notes by timestamp, and returns them to the front end for display.\n\nFiltering by tag uses the same postFind method, but by using the second index, you create and delete notes by using the postDocument and deleteDocument methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIBM Cloudant allows rapid development of web applications, as its HTTP API is modeled by the [Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm-cloud/cloudant) and is easy to integrate with your own code. You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant). Don't forget. The [IBM Cloudant Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-connectingibm-cloudant-dashboard) is a great way to explore your databases, create and modify documents, and refine your index and querying skills.\n\nYou can find more best practice guidance in our [blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/11/21/Best-and-Worst-Practices.html) and [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant/getting-started.html).

The data set \n\n\n\n1. Create a database called books.\n2. Create some sample data that represents a book in a library as shown in the following example:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"BXP9G5ZQY9Q4EA13\",\n\"author\": \"Dickens\",\n\"title\": \"David Copperfield\",\n\"year\": 1840,\n\"pages\": 723,\n\"publisher\": \"Penguin\",\n\"url\": \"https://www.somurl.com/dc\"\n}\n3. Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3. A report that details the number of books that are published by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens. This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. It also has some powerful counting aggregations suitable for drill-down user interfaces.\n\nIBM Cloudant Search also powers type=text IBM Cloudant Query indexes, so a subset of its capabilities is surfaced by using the _find API.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00472-16393-17597", "score": 21.16656, "text": "\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to query a global index:\n\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\n\nSee the following example that uses the command line to query a global index:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl \"https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1\"\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostSearchOptions;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.SearchResult;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nPostSearchOptions searchOptions = new PostSearchOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"<db-name>\")\n.ddoc(\"<ddoc>\")\n.index(\"<index-name>\")\n.query(\":\")\n.includeDocs(true)\n.limit(1)\n.build();\n\nSearchResult response =\nservice.postSearch(searchOptions).execute()\n.getResult();\n\nSystem.out.println(response);\n\nimport { CloudantV1 } from '@ibm-cloud/cloudant';\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({});\n\nservice.postSearch({\ndb: '<db-name>',\nddoc: '<ddoc>',\nindex: '<index-name>',\nquery: ':',\nincludeDocs: true,\nlimit: 1", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-60601-62822", "score": 21.135118, "text": "\nWhen you create a secondary index, you choose whether its purpose is for per-partition or global scope.\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00539-7-1755", "score": 21.024532, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloudant Query FAQ \n\n[IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query) is an API for querying slices of data based on the values of a database's document attributes. It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00469-13046-15136", "score": 20.971407, "text": "\nYou might find that you\u2019re mainly hitting the Query limit, but you have plenty of headroom in Lookups. It might be possible to reduce the reliance on Queries through some remodeling of the data or perhaps doing more work client-side.\n\nThe corollary here though is that you can\u2019t assume that any third-party library or framework optimizes for cost ahead of convenience. Client-side frameworks that support multiple persistence layers by using plug-ins are unlikely to be aware of this situation, or might be incapable of making such tradeoffs.\n\nChecking for third-party library or framework compatibility before you commit to a particular tool is a good idea.\n\nIt is also worth understanding that the rates aren\u2019t directly equivalent to HTTP API endpoint calls. You must expect that, for example, a bulk update counts according to its constituent document writes.\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant documentation on [plans and pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public) on IBM public cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Logging helps you see what\u2019s going on \n\nIBM Cloudant\u2019s logs indicating each API call made, what was requested and how long it took to respond can be automatically spooled to LogDNA for analysis and reporting for IBM Cloud-based services. This data is useful for keeping an eye on request volumes, performance, and whether your application is exceeding the provisioned capacity for your IBM Cloudant service.\n\nYou can set up the logging service at no cost to get started. Paid-for plans allow data to be parsed, retained, and archived to Object Storage.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 20.896208, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01415-6473-8616", "score": 18.202818, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Billing for storage and pull traffic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_billing_traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can images from other registries be scanned? \n\nVulnerability Advisor scans images from IBM Cloud Container Registry only.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is a Vulnerability Advisor scan triggered? \n\nFor more information about how the scanning of an image is triggered, see [Vulnerable packages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index&interface=uipackages).\n\n\n\n\n\n Why doesn't a new image scan? \n\nIf you get the vulnerability report immediately after you add the image to the\n\nregistry, you might receive the following error:\n\nBXNVA0009E: <imagename> has not been scanned.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency.

If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret.

For more information, see [Setting up Secrets Manager in your Kubernetes Service cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Image and registry \n\nEvery deployment is based on an image that holds the instructions for how to spin up the container that runs your app. These instructions include the operating system inside the container and extra software that you want to install. To protect your app, you must protect the image and establish checks to ensure the image's integrity.\n\nShould I use a public or a private registry to store my images?\n: Public registries, such as Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker images and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01535-1902-3811", "score": 20.991404, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Getting started with Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\nUsing Portieris to block the deployment of images with issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor is deprecated.\n\n\n\n About Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor provides functions to help you to secure your images.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023.

It is used to control processes and to link departments and functional areas in a meaningful way. Individual modules include applications for accounting, sales, production, and marketing. More complex tasks in customer or supply chain management can also be done by ERP software. As the successor to the core product SAP ECC, SAP S/4HANA was presented as the intelligent ERP system of the new generation. Thanks to modern technologies, the Software as Service (SaaS) version is designed to help companies standardize processes and make the leap to digitalization.\n\nWhile previous SAP ERP solutions support the most common databases, SAP S/4HANA uses exclusively the SAP HANA in-memory database developed by SAP. This in-memory database offers users the greatest technical benefit and they benefit from increased performance. The \"S\" in S/4HANA stands for \"simple\", while the \"4\" refers to the generation sequence. Compared to the SAP core product SAP ECC, which is still used in most companies, SAP S/4HANA offers many innovative functions that revolutionize the system landscape from the ground up.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans.

Charges for cloud services are based on US dollars. Non-US dollar pricing is calculated by converting the US dollar rate by using market exchange rates published by leading financial institutions. Market exchange rates will be adjusted monthly, except as prohibited or controlled by applicable law.\n\nIBM uses leading financial institution benchmark rates set at the end of the month to go into effect for consumption starting the first day of the next month.

If the subscription duration is more than a year, the subscription is separated into terms of up to one year each. Each term has distinct start dates, end dates, and available credit. You can use the available credit at any point during the term, but credit doesn't roll over to any following terms in the subscription. You can get extra flexibility to use credit from terms that haven't yet started by paying up-front for the entire subscription rather than using monthly, quarterly, or another recurring billing cadence. If your usage exceeds your available credit, the extra usage is billed as overage at the non-discounted rate.\n\nFor example, say that you buy an IBM Cloud platform subscription for $1,000 a month for two years, and the subscription starts 1 July 2019. The subscription is divided into two terms that each contain $12,000 of credit, with one term valid from 1 July 2019 through 30 June 2020, and the next term valid from 1 July 2020 through 30 June 2021. You can use the $12,000 credit of the first term at any time during its one-year period, whether it's $6,500 the first month and $500 a month afterward or $1,000 each month.

If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

The web UI is available only on the public endpoint.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nSome factors that you must consider when you must decide which network to choose are:\n\n\n\n* Corporate requirements on how services and applications can access cloud-based services in your account\n* Security on production workloads\n* Industry compliance regulations\n\n\n\nFor example, you might have the following requirements when you are working in the IBM Cloud:\n\n\n\n* No access to Internet to connect to IBM Cloud services\n* Isolated connectivity for workloads in your account\n\n\n\nWhen you have these requirements, you should move from the public network to the private network.\n\nYou can configure a Monitoring agent to connect to a Monitoring instance through the public network or through the private network. By default, the agent connects through the public network.\n\nYou can make API calls through the public network or through the private network. By default, you make them through the public network.\n\nThe type of network defines the level of isolation and security that is configured to move workloads between cloud-based resources in your account. Consider connecting the Monitoring agent over the private network.\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting up private service endpoints \n\nPrivate network endpoints support routing services over the IBM Cloud private network instead of the public network. A private network endpoint provides a unique IP address that is accessible to you without a VPN connection.\n\n\n\n Step 1: Enabling your account \n\nIf you want to use connections over the public internet, you do not have to enable Service Endpoints on your IBM Cloud account.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-service-connection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16324-4772-6688", "score": 14.335104, "text": "\nPlan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant. The search integration uses IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery to return smart answers to natural language questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5. Plan your handoff strategy \n\nFinally, prevent customers from hitting dead ends by [escalating conversations to a human agent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-human-agent) if the assistant isn't able to resolve a customer's question or problem. As part of your planning, figure out what your escalation strategy is going to be. This strategy will vary depending on the deployment channel you choose.\n\nIf you deploy to your website, you have three options for escalating to a human agent:\n\n\n\n* Inline\n* Email address\n* Phone number\n\n\n\nIf you opt for the inline approach, you can directly escalate to a human agent in your existing contact center tool without forcing the user to leave the web chat widget. This approach also provides the agent with the full context of the conversation. To use either the email address or phone number approach, provide the user with the agent\u2019s email address or phone number.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region.

You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region.

If User-to-User is specified in the transfer_headers list, the session history key is sent in the X-Watson-Assistant-Session-History-Key header.\n\nThe value of the SIP header is limited to 1024 bytes.\n\nHow this data is presented in the SIP REFER message also depends on the value of transfer_headers_send_method(as defined in [Generic Service Desk SIP Parameters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsgeneric-service-desk-sip-parameters)).\n\nThe following example shows the data included as headers:\n\nREFER sip:b@atlanta.example.com SIP/2.0\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP agenta.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK2293940223\nTo: <sip:b@atlanta.example.com>\nFrom: <sip:a@atlanta.example.com>;tag=193402342\nCall-ID: 898234234@agenta.atlanta.example.com\nCSeq: 23 REFER\nMax-Forwards: 7\nRefer-To: sip:user@domain.com", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03158-7739-9484", "score": 15.560907, "text": "\n[checkmark icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/phone-checkmark-save.png) to save each number.\n* To import a set of phone numbers that are stored in a comma-separated values (CSV) file, click the Upload a CSV file icon (![Add phone number](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/phone-integ-import-number.png)), and then find the CSV file that contains the list of phone numbers.\n\nThe phone numbers you upload will replace any existing numbers in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Advanced configuration options \n\nClick the Advanced options tab to make any of the following customizations to the call behavior:\n\n\n\n Handle call and transfer failures \n\nYou can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason.

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Credentials are service-specific and vary based on how each service defines the credentials they need to generate. A credential might contain a user name, password, host name, port, and a URL.\n\nHowever, while the contents of each credential is unique to the service that generates it, all services managed by IAM require that new credentials include an IAM Service access role. Some services might generate more data that requires parameters to be passed in. For example, a service might require you to input a language parameter to set the default language that is returned in the resource key that is generated.\n\nTo create a resource key, call the [Resource Controller API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controllercreate-resource-key) as shown in the following example:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Python\n* Go\n* Node", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13071-11839-12907", "score": 16.501442, "text": "\nIf the intention that the credential be used to grant, access to a subset of buckets and not the entire instance, this policy needs to be edited.

A service credential is a collection of important information that is needed to connect to an instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage. It gives a user an identifier for the instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage (that is, the Resource Instance ID), service and authorization endpoints, and a means of associating the subject with an API key (that is, Service ID).

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 19.888796, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 14.373378, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com. This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-ibm-cis-for-optimal-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04177-7-2309", "score": 18.880276, "text": "\nManaging your CIS deployment \n\nYou'll begin by using the Overview screen as your working base of operations.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}]}

But given the nature of machine learning models and the nuance and subtlety of natural languages processing, you may find some discrepancies from version to version. If you find a major issue through your tests, you have the ability to switch your settings and use Previous to return to the prior behavior. In this event, we recommend you contact IBM and provide details of your test so that that IBM can support you in the steps to resolve the problem.\n\nIt's also recommended that you try the Beta version in one of your test systems after you upgrade. This gives you early visibility to changes that are likely to be delivered in a future version, and will reduce the probability of negative impacts to your production systems. IBM values both positive and negative feedback from customers who use Beta.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-30099-31664", "score": 17.936424, "text": "\n}\nconst token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '10000ms' });\nreturn token;\n}\n\nShow more\n3.

Do not redact the information or replace it wholesale with variables. For best results, replace the real information with fake information of the same type.\n\nFor example, if the PII that you want to protect is client names, then instead of redacting each name or replacing each name with a variable, such as USER_NAME, replace each name with a fake name that uses a variety of typical name syntax styles, such as Jane Doe, Mr. Smith, Dietrich, or Dr. Jones, PhD.

The goal is to simulate as closely as possible real values in the source documents. If the same text (USER_NAME) is used in the documents or text is redacted, you will basically be training the model to expect all names to have that same value or be redacted.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost.

Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located.

A public cloud includes a shared set of resources that are provisioned to allow access to a company's resources. It is hosted in a multi-tenant environment on a virtual server, and it can be accessed from anywhere.\n\nA private cloud includes resources that are provisioned to allow access to a company's resources. It is hosted on dedicated hardware, such as a bare metal server, and either onsite at the company's office (or across offices) or by a cloud provider. A private cloud can be accessed from anywhere.\n\nA hybrid cloud includes resources that combine the aspects of both public and private clouds. It is hosted both onsite at a company's office (or across offices) and by a cloud provider. A hybrid cloud can be accessed from anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-getting-started-tutorial"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11665-7-2043", "score": 15.604082, "text": "\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Infrastructure environment introduction \n\nAn Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environment consists of many components - primarily compute, storage, and network from a specified region (such as the US) and a designated site location (also referred to as a zone), which is a data center site.\n\n\n\n Deployment and management \n\nIBM Cloud VPC Infrastructure offerings, such as virtual or bare metal servers, are deployed through the [IBM Cloud VPC Infrastructure console](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/overview).\n\nAlternatively, deployments can be made and managed by using:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloud CLI\n* IBM Cloud VPC Infrastructure API calls that use an IBM Cloud API key\n* [Terraform Provider for IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-getting-started) by using an IBM Cloud API key\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Managing VPC Infrastructure (IAM)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started).\n\n\n\n\n\n Locations - availability zones \n\nWith availability zones across North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, you can provision cloud resources where (and when) you need them.

In fact, the user_id syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230section-3.2).\n\nThe built-in integrations derive the user ID in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* For Facebook integrations, the user_id property is set to the sender ID that Facebook provides in its payload.\n* For Slack integrations, the user_id property is a concatenation of the team ID, such as T09LVDR7Y, and the member ID of the user, such has W4F8K9JNF. For example: T09LVDR7YW4F8K9JNF.\n* For web chat, you can set the value of the user_id property.\n\n\n\nBilling is managed per monthly active user per service instance. If a single user interacts with assistants that are hosted by different service instances that belong to the same plan, each interaction is treated as a separate use. You are billed for the user's interaction with each service instance separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n Test activity charges \n\nTest messages that you send from the Preview button are charged. For the preview, a random user_id is generated and stored in a cookie. The multiple interactions that a single tester has with the assistant embedded in the preview are recognized as coming from a single user and are charged accordingly. If you are doing your own test, running a scripted regression test for example, use a single user_id for all of the calls within your regression test. Other uses are flagged as abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n Handling anonymous users", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-managing-plan"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05427-9998-11022", "score": 5.3525076, "text": "\nUse [applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads).\n\nDo you need to process a large amount of data in a short time in response to events or requests?\n: If your workload requires a fast response to unpredicted requests or events, then applications are typically a better fit because applications are scaled dynamically, even from zero.

Your assistant remembers this information, and other information about a conversation, as variables. Your assistant can use variables to provide a more personalized and customized experience, and to get users quickly to the solutions they need.\n\nVariables are a powerful tool that you can use to build a better assistant. Variables make possible all of the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* Personalization. The best virtual assistant experiences are targeted and personalized for each customer. When an assistant greets a customer by saying \"Hello, Frank! Welcome back,\" it tells Frank that it remembers his name and that it has talked to him before. By storing this kind of information in variables and then referencing them in your assistant's output, you can personalize the conversation and help your assistant seem more human.\n* Acceleration. Over the course of a conversation, your customers answer questions and make choices. These customer responses are stored as variables, which your assistant can then use to guide a conversation. By choosing the right steps and not wasting your customers' time, you can get them as quickly as possible to the right solution.\n* Modularity. Some information might be useful for many different purposes (for example, a customer's current account balance or contact information). Rather than retrieving or recalculating this information in multiple locations, you can do so once, by using a variable to store the result and then access it wherever you need it.\n\n\n\nA variable is simply a named container for a piece of information; by referencing this container by name, your assistant can store or retrieve the information at run time. For example, a variable that is called account_balance might store your customer's current account balance, a value your assistant can update or retrieve as needed.\n\nThe data that is stored by a variable is characterized by the type of data that it contains, such as text, a numeric value, a date, or even a list of multiple values. The operations that you can perform with a variable vary depending on its data type.\n\n\n\n Action variables and session variables \n\nWatson Assistant supports two categories of variables:\n\n\n\n* Action variables: When a step collects information from the customer, the customer response is automatically stored in an action variable.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05427-8556-10476", "score": 4.722666, "text": "\nA typical example is the processing of image data in a Object Storage bucket or serving machine learning models.

The maximum duration of applications is always limited because maintaining an open connection at scale is expensive. Typical workloads are training machine learning models or hyper-parameter optimization. Use [jobs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-job-plan).\n\nCan you specify the concurrency of your computation upfront?\n: If you know how much computation you need to perform, you can run a job with the exact number of instances until it completes.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow.

To host the HR site, they could easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. Another factor for less personnel costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the Developers can focus on delivering better employee experience for benefits enrollment.\n\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides scalable compute resources and the associated DevOps dashboards to create, scale, and tear down apps and services as needed.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

You can also [set up spending notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending) to get notified when your account or a particular service reaches a specific spending threshold that you set.\n\nWhen you purchase a subscription, you commit to a minimum spending amount for a certain period of time and receive a discount on the overall cost. For example, if you commit to spend $1,000 a month for 6 months, you might get a 5% discount. For the duration of the subscription, you get $6,000 of usage but pay only $5,700 for it. The larger the subscription, the better the discount.\n\nLarge organizations and other users with large cloud workloads can benefit from the savings and predictable billing that are provided by subscriptions.

You can purchase and manage bandwidth metering for classic in two ways, through metering on individual devices, or through collective-metering when you add a device to a bandwidth pool.\n\nAll inbound and outbound bandwidth inside the IBM Cloud Classic infrastructure is unlimited and cost-free for your servers' use. Public egress bandwidth is charged on a tiered basis, with a set allocation for each month of your servers' use.\n\nBandwidth usage is measured as egress traffic on a device's public interfaces.\n\nBandwidth allocations are reserved for all public egress network usage. Devices with individual bandwidth metering and pool-based metering are all measured unless the device is ordered on the private network only.\n\nBandwidth allocation is a threshold where usage below the threshold is free or included, while usage in excess of the threshold is billed as a bandwidth overage. Bandwidth overages are billed individually per server or device, unless they participate in a bandwidth pool.\n\nDevices added to a bandwidth pool contribute both their bandwidth allocation and bandwidth usage to form aggregated totals for the pool. If the pool usage exceeds the total pool allocation, the account owner is billed a consolidated pool overage fee.\n\n\n\n About device bandwidth \n\nYou can manage each device's bandwidth allocation. When you provision certain devices, you can select the amount of bandwidth that you want to allocate to that device. For each device, you pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth allocation during a billing cycle, and receive a notification when the device is at risk of overage for the billing cycle.

This change was necessary to avoid a security exposure in the original regular expression library.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12 June 2017 \n\nUpdates\n: This release includes the following updates:\n\n\n\n* The maximum number of workspaces that you can create with the Lite plan (formerly named the Free plan) changed from 3 to 5.\n* You can now assign any name to a dialog node; it does not need to be unique. And you can subsequently change the node name without impacting how the node is referenced internally. The name you specify is treated as an alias and the system uses its own internal identifier to reference the node.\n* You can no longer change the language of a workspace after you create it by editing the workspace details. If you need to change the language, you can export the workspace as a JSON file, update the language property, and then import the JSON file as a new workspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6 June 2017 \n\nLearn\n: A new Learn about IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant page is available that provides getting started information and links to service documentation and other useful resources. To open the page, click the icon in the page header.\n\nBulk export and delete\n: You can now simultaneously export a number of intents or entities to a CSV file, so you can then import and reuse them for another Watson Assistant application.

It requires that you load all your content into [IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-discovery). Then, when a user asks a question, it has Discovery search for multiple relevant documents and then it generates a natural-language answer that uses the contents of those documents. In some cases, the answer might be taken directly from a single document, and in others, the answer can include information from multiple sources that are combined into a single coherent statement. For each query, NeuralSeek returns a single answer and a confidence score.

Note: A maximum of 100 legal holds can be applied per object.\n\n\n\n\n\n Indefinite retention \n\nAllows the user to set the object to be stored indefinitely until a new retention period is applied. This is set at a per object level.\n\n\n\n\n\n Event-based retention \n\nImmutable Object Storage allows users to set indefinite retention on the object if they are unsure of the final duration of the retention period, or want to use event-based retention. Once set to indefinite, user applications can then can change the object retention to a finite value later. For example, a company has a policy of retaining employee records for three years after the employee leaves the company. When an employee joins the company, the records that are associated with that employee can be indefinitely retained. When the employee leaves the company, the indefinite retention is converted to a finite value of three years from the current time, as defined by company policy. The object is then protected for three years after the retention period change. A user or third-party application can change the retention period from indefinite to finite retention that uses an SDK or REST API.\n\n\n\n\n\n Permanent retention \n\nPermanent retention ensures that data can not be deleted, ever, by anyone. Read the documentation carefully and do not use permanent retention unless there is a compelling regulatory or compliance need for permanent data storage.\n\nPermanent retention can only be enabled at a IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket level with retention policy enabled and users are able to select the permanent retention period option during object uploads. Once enabled, this process can't be reversed and objects uploaded that use a permanent retention period cannot be deleted. It's the responsibility of the users to validate at their end if there's a legitimate need to permanently store objects by using Object Storage buckets with a retention policy.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutable"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05044-62456-64487", "score": 13.465668, "text": "\nThe retention period of an object can only be extended.

You can optionally include a message that summarizes the user's issue to be provided to the human agent. It is the responsibility of the external service to display a message that is shown to the user that explains that the conversation is being transferred. The dialog does not manage that communication itself. The dialog transfer does not occur when you are testing nodes with this response type in the Try it out pane. You must access a node that uses this response type from a test deployment to see how your users will experience it.\n* Image: Embeds an image into the response. The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options. When a user clicks one of the options, an associated user input value is sent to your assistant. How options are rendered can differ depending on where you deploy the dialog. For example, in one integration channel the options might be displayed as clickable buttons, but in another they might be displayed as a dropdown list.\n* Pause: Forces the application to wait for a specified number of milliseconds before continuing with processing. You can choose to show an indicator that the dialog is working on typing a response. Use this response type if you need to perform an action that might take some time. For example, a parent node makes a Cloud Function call and displays the result in a child node. You could use this response type as the response for the parent node to give the programmatic call time to complete, and then jump to the child node to show the result.

At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person. Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request.

Containment is the rate at which your assistant is able to satisfy a customer's request without human intervention per conversation.\n\nTo measure containment accurately, the metric must be able to identify when a human intervention occurs. The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}]}

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "score": 13.890135, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03126-1789-4208", "score": 13.115055, "text": "\nActivate a credit card Your assistant can use a conversational flow to collect information for identity verification, and then call a webhook to submit the request to activate the card on the user's behalf. \n Complete a simple task that involves a complicated application Your assistant can link them to a 2-minute video that illustrates how to complete the task. \n Learn about insurance plan details after the death of a loved one Your assistant can connect the customer directly to a person who can show empathy and patience as the matter is addressed. \n Solve a problem that requires a long and involved procedure to fix Instead of trying to walk the customer through the procedure step by step in conversation, your assistant can link to a help center that documents the full procedure in detail. \n The customer calls support and your assistant answers Let's say the assistant needs a lot of details from the customer before it can help. Instead of trying to prompt the customer for each piece of information and transcribe it properly, your assistant can switch to SMS text messaging.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03405-3051-4760", "score": 14.750582, "text": "\nClick the System entities tab, and then turn on these entities:\n\n\n\n* @sys-time\n* @sys-date\n* @sys-number\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have successfully enabled the @sys-date, @sys-time, and @sys-number system entities.

For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response.

The assistant adds a layer of function to your skill that enables Watson Assistant to orchestrate and manage the flow of information for you. See [Assistants](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants).\n* Built-in integrations: Instead of going to the Deploy tab to deploy your workspace, you add your dialog skill to an assistant, and add integrations to the assistant through which the skill is made available to your users.

They created clusters for a Development environment that allow worldwide Developers to collaboratively deploy app improvements quickly.\n\nSecurity first: The Development Exec chose bare metal to host the research clusters. With bare metal for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, the sensitive research workloads now have familiar isolation but within the flexibility of public cloud.

For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04085-7-1799", "score": 18.817595, "text": "\nKubernetes \n\nThe IBM Blockchain Platform allows you to provision blockchain components into your Kubernetes cluster.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04810-7-1962", "score": 25.116112, "text": "\nDeployment Journey Overview \n\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service(IKS) is a managed offering to create your own Kubernetes cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

Two documents in the same database can have the same _id field. In other databases, you specify which column is the unique identifier, but in IBM Cloudant, it's always _id and can't be changed.\n\nAlso, unlike relational databases, IBM Cloudant does not have \"auto-incrementing IDs\" that is, an ID field that starts at 1 and increments for each document added.\n\nIBM Cloudant's _id field is one of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* A 32-character string generated by IBM Cloudant.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00474-7885-8455", "score": 19.322746, "text": "\nSummary \n\nToday, we combined two IBM Cloud services to optimize cost and user experience: IBM Cloudant as a document store and query engine and Databases for Redis as a content cache.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly.

Refer to your OS Documentation for limits on the number of file shares that can be mounted.\n* How many files and directories are allowed for specific file volume sizes? What is the maximum number of inodes allowed per volume size?\n\nThe number of files a volume can contain is determined by how many inodes it has. An inode is a data structure that contains information about files. Volumes have both private and public inodes. Public inodes are used for files that are visible to the customer and private inodes are used for files that are used internally by the storage system. The maximum number of files setting is 2 billion. However, this maximum value can be configured only with volumes of 7.8 TB or larger. The maximum number of inodes that can be configured on a volume is calculated by taking the total allocated volume size in KB and dividing it by 4. Any volume of 7.8 TB or larger reaches the maximum limit at 2,040,109,451 inodes.\n\n\n\nTable comparison\nTable 1 shows the maximum number of inodes that are allowed based on the volume size.

These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

You can use the Connect to agent response type in an action step to initiate a transfer to a live agent at a specific point in the conversation. When a Connect to agent response is sent to the phone integration, a SIP transfer is initiated using the SIP REFER message, as defined by [RFC 5589](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5589section-6.1).\n\nFor more information about initiating a transfer to a live agent during the conversation, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* [Setting up live agent escalation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone)\n* [Defining responses using the JSON editor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-assistant-responses-json)\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports additional parameters for the Connect to agent response type. You can add these phone-specific parameters to the connect_to_agent response type using the JSON editor.\n\nThe connect_to_agent response type supports the ability to specify the target transfer information under the transfer_info parameter.\n\nThe following example shows a transfer that uses all of the configurable parameters:\n\n{\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"connect_to_agent\",\n\"transfer_info\": {\n\"target\": {\n\"service_desk\": {\n\"sip\": {\n\"uri\": \"sip:user\\@domain.com\",\n\"transfer_headers\":\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16321-7378-9006", "score": 28.190727, "text": "\nWhen configuring dynamically from Watson Assistant using the configure command, note that only the root level fields, such as narrowband or broadband, are updated.

For example, if you obtain 10,000 access tokens, then you turn on password policy management and obtain 10,000 more.

To build the framework that will drive that analysis and work, we outlined profiles for continuous availability and advanced recovery applications with common sets of resources to create the scaffolding that application teams can use for their own applications. For more information, see [Designing an architecture for your application resiliency objectives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-bcdr-app-recovery).\n\n\n\n DR strategy options \n\nThere are many options to implement DR solutions.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server. This capability allows you to decentralize the management of a large domain (such as ibm.com).\n\nA custom domain name server allows you to utilize the DNS provider's servers with the customized reference name of your own domain. For example, you can define your name server to be ns1.cloud.ibm.com instead of ns1.acme.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally 'sign' DNS data so you can be assured it is valid.

If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server.

Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed.

It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks or challenges visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a nonstandard user agent. This tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again. This challenge is based on the visitor's IP, and therefore does not apply to challenges presented by WAF rules because they are based on an action that the user performs on your site.\n* Security level - Sets the security level of your website to determine which visitors receive a challenge page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13915-3198-5235", "score": 19.25963, "text": "\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 1 action drop\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 1 source address network-group1\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 action drop\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 destination port 23\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 log\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 protocol tcp\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 source address network-group2\n\nIn the ruleset, ALLOW_LEGACY, there are two rules defined.

For example, DNS resolver services are running on 10.0.80.11 and 10.0.80.12. Other subnets are used during provisioning and support. You can find the IP ranges used in the data centers in [this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).\n\nYou can allow data center access by placing the proper SERVICE-ALLOW rules at the beginning of the firewall rule sets with an action of accept. Where the rule set must be applied depends on the routing and firewall design being implemented.\n\nIt is recommended that you place the firewall rules in the location which causes the least duplication of work. For example, allowing backend subnets inbound on dp0bond0 would be less work than allowing backend subnets outbound toward each VLAN virtual interface.\n\n\n\n Per-interface firewall rules \n\nOne method for configuring the firewall on a VRA is to apply firewall rule sets to each interface. In this case an interface can be a dataplane interface (dp0s0) or a virtual interface (dp0bond0.303).

For any key types that have a low percentage of corpus density, you might want to focus on finding more annotations of those type in the source documents. But, don't worry too much about coreference and relation accuracy if mention accuracy is deficient. Relation mentions between entities and coreferences of entities cannot be accurate unless entity mentions are accurate to begin with.\n* Fix human annotations\n\nCheck to see whether your training data is consistently and fully annotated. A machine learning model learns from your ground truth annotations. For example, if a sentence contains the phrase Obama family, and you label \"Obama\" as PERSON in one sentence and \"Obama family\" as PEOPLE in another sentence, the inconsistency means that the machine learning model cannot learn the correct annotation. Likewise, if you label \"Obama\" as PERSON in one sentence but do not label his name at all in another sentence, the annotation effort is incomplete and the machine learning model will be improperly trained. This type of inconsistent and partial labeling is sometimes referred to as type confusion. In most cases, just the act of having multiple human annotators review an overlapping set of documents will surface occurrences of type confusion-related mistakes. Pay attention to the issues that surface during document conflict resolution because they can provide insight into deeper issues with the type system itself. If there is no room to further improve or refine the type system, then it might be necessary to update the annotation guidelines and include examples.

For any key types that have a low percentage of corpus density, you might want to focus on finding more annotations of those type in the source documents. But, don't worry too much about coreference and relation accuracy if mention accuracy is deficient. Relation mentions between entities and coreferences of entities cannot be accurate unless entity mentions are accurate to begin with.\n* Fix human annotations\n\nCheck to see whether your training data is consistently and fully annotated. A machine learning model learns from your ground truth annotations. For example, if a sentence contains the phrase Obama family, and you label \"Obama\" as PERSON in one sentence and \"Obama family\" as PEOPLE in another sentence, the inconsistency means that the machine learning model cannot learn the correct annotation. Likewise, if you label \"Obama\" as PERSON in one sentence but do not label his name at all in another sentence, the annotation effort is incomplete and the machine learning model will be improperly trained. This type of inconsistent and partial labeling is sometimes referred to as type confusion. In most cases, just the act of having multiple human annotators review an overlapping set of documents will surface occurrences of type confusion-related mistakes. Pay attention to the issues that surface during document conflict resolution because they can provide insight into deeper issues with the type system itself. If there is no room to further improve or refine the type system, then it might be necessary to update the annotation guidelines and include examples.

You could end up reversing any gains you made by doing a thorough job with the first 5 documents.\n* Consistent annotation is at least as important as correct annotation.\n\nSome decisions regarding annotation guidelines are arbitrary, like whether car trim lines should be considered part of model names, such as Camry or Camry LX.

Availability groups on Linux clusters require at least two synchronous replicas to guarantee HA, but at least three replicas for automatic recovery, so it is recommend that an availability group is setup on at least three nodes.\n* None - Known as clusterless availability groups or was initially referred to as a read-scale availability group. However, this option provides only a subset of availability groups features, and does not include automatic failover. The features do include manual planned and forced failover and both synchronous and asynchronous replication modes, readable secondary nodes, and secondary replica backups. Availability groups without a WSFC cluster can still provide readable secondary nodes, read-only routing, and load balancing. Failover can be automated with external tools. A new feature of SQL Server 2019 helps mitigate this with automatic traffic redirection, which provides for routing of read/write traffic back to the primary node and does not require a Listener.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/microsoft?topic=microsoft-mssql-dualmzr"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11589-41482-42491", "score": 12.6742, "text": "\nCluster Summary:\n* Stack: corosync\n* Current DC: cl-sap-1 (version 2.0.5-9.el8_4.5-ba59be7122) - partition with quorum\n* Last updated: Tue Feb 14 09:03:19 2023\n* Last change: Tue Feb 14 09:01:40 2023 by s01adm via crm_resource on cl-sap-1\n* 2 nodes configured\n* 11 resource instances configured\n\nNode List:\n* Online: [ cl-sap-1 cl-sap-2 ]\n\nFull List of Resources:\n* res_fence_ibm_powervs\t(stonith:fence_ibm_powervs):\t Started cl-sap-1\n* Resource Group: s01_ascs01_group:\n* s01_vip_ascs01\t(ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):\t Started cl-sap-2\n* s01_fs_ascs01_lvm\t(ocf::heartbeat:LVM-activate):\t Started cl-sap-2\n* s01_fs_ascs01\t(ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):\t Started cl-sap-2\n* s01_ascs01\t(ocf::heartbeat:SAPInstance):\t Started cl-sap-2\n* Resource Group: s01_ers02_group:\n* s01_vip_ers02\t(ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):\t Started cl-sap-1\n* s01_fs_ers02_lvm\t(ocf::heartbeat:LVM-activate):\t Started cl-sap-1\n* s01_fs_ers02\t(ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):\t Started cl-sap-1\n* s01_ers02\t(ocf::heartbeat:SAPInstance):\t Started cl-sap-1", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-ensa"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10527-23624-25627", "score": 12.669594, "text": "\n: When you run oc get nodes, you might notice that the ROLES of your worker nodes are marked as both master,worker.

For example, a VPC load balancer exposes the router services in your cluster by default.

This third-party software interacts with the IBM Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller to offer easy configuration, centralized management, and lower operational costs.\n\nWorking along with IBM Cloud\u00ae Schematics (Infrastructure as Code) and the IBM Content catalog, customers are able to instantiate best-in-network solutions to manage their workload.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n\n\n*  Instantiating virtual network services and modifying configurations without the need to deploy new network hardware.\n*  Rapid service delivery with the agility to scale well above physical hardware.\n*  Centralized policy control.\n*  Using the same routers, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs in IBM Cloud that were used in physical hardware or other cloud providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11566-3389-5547", "score": 15.052006, "text": "\n* Private network: provides complete control of the secured networking traffic without performance degradation if significant public network traffic occurs at the same time; the private network has three functional areas:\n\n\n\n* Host to and from Host: network traffic in the private VLANs assigned to you.

Bandwidth is free and unmetered.\n* VPN and direct connections to and from VLAN: network traffic to and from an existing internal network over direct connection or VPN that uses a distinct stand-alone network to the secure private VLAN. Bandwidth is free and unmetered.\n* Data center to Data center interconnectivity: provides secure connectivity between hosts across IBM Cloud data center locations. Bandwidth is free and unmetered.\n\n\n\n* Management network: provides Out-Of-Band Management (OOBM) accessible through VPN (for example the built-in SSL VPN for administration) or direct connection (for example IBM Cloud Direct Link). Network management allows Remote Console access through the IPMI network interface for Bare Metals hosts on the private network. Bandwidth is free and unmetered.\n\n\n\nThis network-within-a-network topology design provides maximum accessibility, security, and control for your IT infrastructure. The topology provides the ease of a public network with the security of a private network by keeping systems accessible to administrators and safely off-limits to external users.\n\n\n\n Networking VLANs \n\nThe Virtual LAN (VLAN) assigned to you on the Classic Infrastructure network, provides an enterprise-grade private network with full isolation and security. Each VLAN is either public or private, and each VLAN is assigned to a specific data center for a specific IBM Cloud Account.\n\nThe following information is a summary of [Getting started with VLANs on Classic Infrastructure](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-getting-started) and [About VLANs on Classic Infrastructure](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-about-vlans).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-classic-env-introduction"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15745-3108-5252", "score": 14.36241, "text": "\nRoute mode for VNFs Yes (see [Setting up high availability for Virtual Network Functions (VNF)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf)) No \n Virtual Servers on VPC Yes Yes \n Member type Virtual server instances Virtual server instances, Bare Metal, Power Systems Virtual Server \n Power Systems Virtual Server instances connected over Direct Link No Yes (No support for instance groups) \n\n\n\n\n\n High Availability mode \n\nThe application load balancer is configured in active-active mode. All compute resources of the load balancer are actively involved in forwarding traffic.\n\nHigh Availability (HA) is achieved by using a Domain Name Service (DNS). The Virtual IP (VIP) of each compute resource is registered to the assigned DNS. If any of the compute resources go down, the other resources continue to forward traffic.\n\nAn NLB is configured in active-standby mode. A single VIP is registered with DNS, and traffic is forwarded through that compute resource. If an active compute resource goes down, the standby takes over and the VIP is transferred to the standby.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-zone support \n\nNetwork load balancers can accept members across all three availability zones, but the NLB itself resides in one specific zone. A zone is identified by the subnet that is selected when a load balancer is created. Cloud Internet Services (CIS) Global Load Balancer or Private DNS can be used with multiple zonal network load balancers for multi-zone availability.\n\nThe application load balancer can also be configured to span multiple zones. The back-end servers can be in any zone within a region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration with private catalogs \n\nIBM Cloud Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer both integrate with private catalogs to centrally manage access to products in the IBM Cloud catalog and your own catalogs. You can customize your private catalogs to allow or disallow load balancer provisioning to specific users in your account.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat. This can be either a generated unique identifier (for anonymous users) or an authenticated user ID.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03180-5630-7213", "score": 22.691635, "text": "\nEnabling visitor authentication also enables support for cross-domain traffic and cross-browser identification.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-14167-16117", "score": 15.613037, "text": "\n{location}.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud: Hosts the web chat server, which handles communication with your assistant. Replace {location} with the location of the data center where your service instance is located, which is part of the service endpoint URL. For more information, see [Finding and updating the endpoint URL](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson?topic=watson-endpoint-changeendpoint-find-update).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reviewing security \n\nThe web chat integration undergoes tests and scans on a regular basis to find and address potential security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nBe sure to run your own security reviews to see how the web chat fits in with your current website structure and policies. The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs. For information about how to avoid this problem, see [Managing user identity information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-userid).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 15.317984, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

If your list contains five or more options, then they are displayed in a drop-down list.\n* Pause: This response type pauses the assistant's activity in the chat. However, activity does not resume after the pause until another response is triggered. Whenever you include a pause response type, add another, different response type, such as text, after it.\n\n\n\nFor more information about rich response types, see [Rich responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multimedia).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-33522-35244", "score": 14.895764, "text": "\nIn the web chat, the linked video will render using the embeddable player for the hosting service.\n\nSpecify the URL you would use to view the video in your browser (for example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52bpMKVigGU).

If the device goes offline in the middle of a conversation, appropriate error messages and retries occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a JavaScript bridge \n\nIn some situations, your mobile application might need to communicate with the Watson Assistant web chat. For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16334-20193-22029", "score": 18.777273, "text": "\n* \"User is typing\" support: The web chat now supports displaying the \"user is typing\" message for service desks.

You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03126-1789-4208", "score": 16.015705, "text": "\nActivate a credit card Your assistant can use a conversational flow to collect information for identity verification, and then call a webhook to submit the request to activate the card on the user's behalf. \n Complete a simple task that involves a complicated application Your assistant can link them to a 2-minute video that illustrates how to complete the task. \n Learn about insurance plan details after the death of a loved one Your assistant can connect the customer directly to a person who can show empathy and patience as the matter is addressed. \n Solve a problem that requires a long and involved procedure to fix Instead of trying to walk the customer through the procedure step by step in conversation, your assistant can link to a help center that documents the full procedure in detail. \n The customer calls support and your assistant answers Let's say the assistant needs a lot of details from the customer before it can help. Instead of trying to prompt the customer for each piece of information and transcribe it properly, your assistant can switch to SMS text messaging.

But if you give them a chance to explain something in writing, they tend to do so willingly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How will customers find your assistant? \n\nDeploy your assistant where customers can find it with ease. For example, you can embed the assistant in your company website or add it to a messaging platform such as Facebook, Slack, or WhatsApp.\n\nWhile the conversational skill is defined in text, customers can talk with your assistant over the phone when you deploy it by using the phone integration.\n\nFor more information about ways to deploy the assistant, see [Adding integrations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add).\n\nUnderstanding where you will deploy the assistant before you begin can help you author the right types of answers for a given channel or platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n What languages does your assistant speak? \n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it.

As such, both accented and non-accented versions of words might be treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever for some languages, like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity might implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word \"barri\u00f3\", which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb \"barrer\" (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word \"barrio\" (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" vs. \"una\". In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support"}]}

But there is one major difference between the redundancy that is provided in a mainframe and the redundancy that is provided in the cloud \u2013 in the cloud the redundancy must be managed by the user. This means that to design a system to run with high availability on the cloud the system designer needs to be familiar with various high availability issues, as well as the design issues associated with the system that they are trying to build.\n\nThere are decades of academic and practical writings on high availability, and much of the work requires a good understanding of probability mathematics. However, much like with the formula, many of the principles become obvious when properly explained. Redundancy, which can be complicated in some cases, such as the various levels of RAID disk subsystems, is simply a way of dealing with a widely known principle of system design: \u201cAvoid single points of failure.\u201d Admittedly, while the phrase is simple and obvious, implementation can be tricky.\n\nRather than go into the complexities of such implementations, we cover a high-level overview of the areas that need to be addressed by anyone looking to build or run a highly available cloud system.\n\nBeyond the general principles of redundancy, fast repair, and single points of failure (SPOFs), probably the most important thing to understand is that improving availability requires spending effort on avoiding likely causes of outages, rather than trying to harden the system against all possible outages.\n\nAn example can help to make this clear. In astronomy, it is understood that our solar system will effectively end when the Sun goes nova. This will obviously cause all the computing systems on Earth to fail. Hence it is not something worth spending time and money on avoiding. Perhaps that particular example seems too extreme. So as a much simpler, business-oriented example, consider a city-wide fire, such as the one that burned down much of Chicago in the late 1800s. Fires on that scale are unusual, but not unique. As a business, should you spend time and money making sure that your computer systems could survive such a fire?

While large quantum computers are not available today, any TLS data-in-transit that has been snooped and stored can be breached when these large quantum computers are made available. Data has a long shelf life so it is critical that Key Protect supports quantum safe cryptographic algorithms to secure TLS communications.\n\nTo keep your in-transit data resilient, Key Protect has introduced the ability to use a quantum safe enabled TLS connection to ensure that your data is secure during the key exchange process.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the considerations of Quantum Safe Cryptography? \n\nBefore configuring your service to send requests to Key Protect through a quantum safe enabled Key Protect service endpoint, please keep in mind the following considerations:\n\n\n\n* The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the process of [standardizing quantum safe algorithms](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography).

So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures. However, usually the combination of different services and data bridges requires high performance and flexible pipelines. Spanning from IoT devices up to cloud storage, and an analytics platform. Often pre-configured bridges lack the programmability to implement and fine-tune a particular solution architecture. Given the variety of pipelines, and the lack of standardization around data fusion in general (IoT in particular), it is common to see environments where the pipeline requires custom data transformation. These custom data transformations apply to format conversion, filtering, or augmentation. Cloud Functions is an excellent tool to implement such a transformation, in a serverless manner, where the custom logic is hosted on a fully managed and elastic cloud platform.\n\nLook at the following sample IoT application that uses Cloud Functions, Node-RED, Cognitive, and other services: [Serverless transformation of IoT data-in-motion with Cloud Functions](https://medium.com/openwhisk/serverless-transformation-of-iot-data-in-motion-with-openwhisk-272e36117d6c).\n\n\n\n\n\n API backend \n\nServerless computing platforms give developers a rapid way to build APIs without servers.

Local, regional, and global geographic redundancy\n\n\n\n\n\n Technical redundancy \n\nMost public clouds have standardized geographic redundancy, although the various vendors do it in slightly different ways. But technical redundancy is not provided by the cloud vendors. Instead, they provide the tools for customers to build their own technical redundancy. Rather than go into the myriad complexities around technical redundancy, which is a key area for the technical teams building systems, there are a couple of key things to keep in mind when thinking about technical redundancy.\n\nThe first is that higher level of availability typically requires higher levels of replication. Thus, in well-designed systems, those with double, triple, and quadruple redundancy, show improvements in availability as the degree of redundancy goes up. \u201cWell designed\u201d hides a lot of complexity in highly available system design.\n\nThe second key aspect of technical redundancy that is worth remembering is that more copies does not automatically mean higher availability. There are two reasons for this. First, if there is a design defect, all your copies are likely to fail in a similar way when faced with similar conditions. In the computer world, design defects are normally called software bugs, and they are not rare. The second reason that more copies do not always lead to higher availability is that you need to know when a copy has broken so you can stop using it. If you don't or can't do that, more copies will actually decrease the apparent availability of the system.\n\nThe sorts of problems that arise can be seen with a couple of different examples. The first is the old style of home smoke detector that didn\u2019t have a feature to indicate low battery. Without that feature, the homeowner did not have a way of knowing if the detector would work in the case of a fire. This omission could be worked around, and people would replace the battery once a year whether it needed it or not.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations"}]}
