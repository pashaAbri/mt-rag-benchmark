The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.\n* Am I charged for all audio that I send, even audio that does not include speech?\n\nYes, all audio that you send to the service contributes to your cumulative minutes of audio. This includes silence and noisy audio that does not contain or otherwise contribute to speech recognition.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test?

Customers see a performance increase because distances between our PoPs are typically shorter than the distances between PoPs and origins.

Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\nAll Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by Hyper Protect Crypto Services. For more information, see [Encryption at rest](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-at-rest). In addition, a geographically separate region should be used as an [alternative storage site](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-bcdryour-workloads-requirements-alternate-storage-site). This means you should use [cross region resiliency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpointsendpoints-geo) for all of your Object Storage buckets.\n\nTo start working with Object Storage, see the following instructions:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05166-15912-16684", "score": 18.045439, "text": "\nThis allows for lower latency when accessing storage from compute resources co-located within the same data center, or for data requiring a specific geographic location.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-updates"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05167-7-1758", "score": 17.721754, "text": "\nUpload data \n\nAfter getting your storage organized into buckets, it's time to add some objects by uploading data.\n\nDepending on how you want to use your storage, there are different ways to get data into the system. A data scientist has a few large files that are used for analytics, a systems administrator needs to keep database backups synchronized with local files, and a developer is writing software that needs to read and write millions of files. Each of these scenarios is best served by different methods of data ingest.\n\nSome applications may wish to restrict a user or Service ID to only uploading data, without any access to reading data in a bucket. This is possible through the Object Writer [IAM role](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam).\n\n\n\n Using the console \n\nTypically, using the web-based console is not the most common way to use Object Storage. Objects are limited to 200 MB and the file name and key are identical. Multiple objects can be uploaded at the same time, and if the browser allows for multiple threads each object will be uploaded by using multiple parts in parallel. Support for larger object sizes and improved performance (depending on network factors) is provided by [Aspera high-speed transfer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-aspera).\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a compatible tool \n\nSome users want to use a stand-alone utility to interact with their storage. As the Cloud Object Storage API supports the most common set of S3 API operations, many S3-compatible tools can also connect to Object Storage by using [HMAC credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-uhc-hmac-credentials-main).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-316391-318406", "score": 17.67161, "text": "\nIBM Secure Content Store powered by IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage provides unparalleled agility in supporting fast, highly consistent application deployment around the world to help customers securely expand their business into new regions, from business-critical data to video archive solutions.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06932-7-2330", "score": 17.547544, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloud Direct Link to connect to IBM Cloud Object Storage \n\nYou can configure IBM Cloud\u00ae Direct Link so that you have access to IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS). Although the methods described here were designed and tested with COS, they can work for certain other IBM Cloud services.\n\nBy policy, IBM Cloud Direct Link denies access to IBM Cloud private service endpoints, including those endpoints used by COS. The technique that is described in this document relies on indirect access to COS through servers hosted in a customer's IBM Cloud account. After setup, each customer's server can forward traffic bidirectionally between IBM Cloud private service endpoints and their remote networks that are connected by Direct Link.\n\n\n\n What is IBM Cloud Object Storage? \n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) is a web-scale solution that stores unstructured data. It provides reliability, security, availability, and disaster recovery without manual replication.\n\nThe information that is stored within IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted and dispersed across many geographic locations. It's accessible through an implementation of the S3 API. This service uses distributed storage technologies that are provided by the IBM Cloud Object Storage service.\n\nIBM COS is available in three configurations:\n\n\n\n* Cross Region service provides higher durability and availability than using a single region, but at the cost of slightly higher latency. This service is available today in the US and the EU. By using a Virtual Router Appliance (VRA), you also might use Direct Link to connect to COS in the Asia Pacific region.\n* Regional service provides the reverse. It distributes objects across many availability zones within a single region. If a region or availability zone is inaccessible, the object store continues to function smoothly. Any missed changes are applied when the inaccessible data center comes back online.\n* Single Site service offers affordable access to COS in a selected data center.\n\n\n\n\n\n COS private and public endpoints \n\nEndpoints are URLs that applications use to issue COS commands and exchange data with COS. Every endpoint uses the same application programming interface (API) to interact with COS.\n\nServers that are provisioned within IBM Cloud use private API endpoints for services, including COS.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-using-ibm-cloud-direct-link-to-connect-to-ibm-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10864-7221-9477", "score": 17.390543, "text": "\nSupported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them. This technology is the \u201ccognitive\u201d extension of the [Data Processing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_casesuse_cases_data) use case that was discussed earlier. Another good use for Cloud Functions is to implement Bot function that is combined with cognitive services.\n\nA sample application, [Dark vision](https://github.com/IBM-cloud/openwhisk-darkvisionapp), is provided and does just that. In this application, the user uploads a video or image by using the Dark Vision web application, which stores it in an IBM Cloudant DB. Once the video is uploaded, Cloud Functions detect the new video by listening to IBM Cloudant changes (trigger). Cloud Functions then triggers the video extractor action. During its execution, the extractor produces frames (images) and stores them in IBM Cloudant. The frames are then processed with Watson Visual Recognition, and the results are stored in the same IBM Cloudant DB. The results can be viewed by using the Dark Vision web application or an iOS application. IBM Cloud Object Storage can be used in addition to IBM Cloudant, where video and image metadata are stored in IBM Cloudant, and the media files are stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n Event processing with Kafka or Event Streams \n\nCloud Functions is ideally to be used in combination with Kafka, IBM\u00ae Event Streams for IBM Cloud\u00ae (Kafka based), and other messaging systems.

The system distributes these slices across a network of data centers, making transmission and storage of data inherently private and secure.

The Part of Speech and Entities enrichments are applied. The Entities enrichment is helpful for identifying important information and introduces more ways to filter query results. \n Testing queries from the Improve and customize page in Discovery You see only one of the responses that are returned from the chatbot. You cannot see all of the available responses and cannot analyze individual query results. You can filter query results by enrichment-based facets. You can review details about fields that are indexed in the source documents that are returned for a query. Access to more information makes it easier to troubleshoot unexpected results. \n Search triggers Returns answers from the text field automatically. If answers are stored in another field, you must change the configuration. You can apply a Smart Document Understanding (SDU) model or enrichments to your collections and retrieve useful information from fields other than text when search is triggered from the assistant. \n\n\n\nFor both project types, the best way to test is to trigger search from the Watson Assistant preview. When you configure search support for an assistant, you can fine-tune the experience in ways that aren't available in Discovery.\n\nAnd settings that are available from the Search results tool for a Document Retrieval project type are replaced by configuration settings that you specify in Watson Assistant.

Starting 30 November 2017, the way that score is calculated changed. It is recommended that you only use the score value to rank documents in a single search, not across searches or sessions. If you trained a collection, a score value is returned in the results of a natural language query. Because the score indicates the relative relevancy between query results, it is not recommended tht it be used as a threshold. Instead, use the confidence, which indicates the relevance of the result as compared to the trained model, to set thresholds.

Usage is organized according to your enterprise hierarchy, so costs are broken down by the accounts and account groups that are directly under the enterprise.\n\nIn the Support section, you can view the total support costs for all accounts within your enterprise. The starting credit reflects the monthly amount in your support subscription. If the support usage for the month was more than this amount, it's displayed as overage.\n\nUsage information for classic infrastructure services is not included for the current billing period. However, it is included for previous billing periods, which you can view by selecting an earlier month from the Time frame menu. For more information, see [Viewing usage for your classic infrastructure resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-infra-usage).\n3.

To convert an account, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule).\n\nEach enterprise supports only a single billing currency. All accounts must use the enterprise billing currency before you add them to the enterprise. Existing accounts that are imported into the enterprise no longer separately manage their billing. As a result, subscription credit can't be added to individual child accounts. Subscription credit must be added to the enterprise account, where it becomes part of the enterprise credit pool.\n\n\n\n Billing transition when importing accounts \n\nWhen you import an existing account to an enterprise, its billing and invoicing transitions to being managed by the enterprise account. This transition includes the following changes to the account.\n\n\n\n* For Subscription accounts that are added, the account type is changed to Pay-As-You-Go. This change reflects that the account does not have its own subscriptions, but it still has full access to production-ready, billable services.\n* Subscriptions and promotions from each account are moved to the enterprise account, where they become part of the credit pool. After the move, each subscription has the same remaining credit and term period, but the subscription is given a new unique ID.\n* Access to billing and payment information for future billing periods is restricted to users in the enterprise account. Users in a child account can't access billing and payment information, such as invoices, payments, or subscriptions, even if they previously had access in the account. To view or manage billing, users need to be invited to the enterprise account and given access to the Billing service in that account.\n* Usage is invoiced to the enterprise account for the entire month when the account was added. For example, if you add an account to the enterprise on 15 June, all of the usage for the month of June is reflected in the July invoice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shared credit pool \n\nThe enterprise credit pool consolidates credit from all accounts in the enterprise and shares it with the accounts.

The pool includes credit from all sources, including platform subscription credit, promotional credit, and support credit. When accounts in the enterprise create and use resources, the cost for this usage is deducted from the credit pool.\n\nWhen existing subscriptions are added to the enterprise, each individual subscription term is re-created within the credit pool, including characteristics such as the remaining credit balance, start dates, and end dates. As credit is used, the subscription terms burn down individually according to when they expire. For example, you imported two accounts with existing subscriptions in August 2019. One subscription, 32100456, is for $1,000 for 18 months that began in January 2019. Because it spans multiple years, the subscription is divided into terms of up to one year each. The other subscription, 55543210 is for $500 a month for two years that began in April 2019, which is also divided into multiple terms. Then, you purchased a new one-year subscription, 00012345, through your enterprise for $1,500 a month that starts in July 2020. As enterprise users use resources, credit is deducted from the first term from subscription 32100456 because it expires the soonest, then the first term from subscription 55543210 because it expires next, and so on. This behavior ensures optimum usage of your purchased subscription credit.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Subscriptions in an enterprise credit pool\nThis table has column headers and a summary row.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions. A common table expression permits defining a result table with a table name that can be specified as a table name in any FROM clause of the fullselect that follows.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16353-2640-4846", "score": 13.781716, "text": "\nYou can select any step that precedes the step you are editing.\n\nNote that only the selected steps will repeat, regardless of their And then settings. Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3. Click Apply.\n\n\n\nAny session variable values that were defined based on choices that the customer made in the repeated steps are cleared and replaced with the new responses.\n\nThere is no option to jump to a later step. Instead of jumping directly to a later step, control the flow through the intervening steps with step conditions or skipping steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n Go to a subaction \n\nAn action that is called from another action is referred to as a subaction. This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it. For example, as part of an action to place an order, you might call a subaction that enables a new customer to create an account.\n\nTo call a subaction:\n\n\n\n1.

Each query result is written by default to a CSV file in a Cloud Object Storage instance where you created the integration.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1. Read about [partitioned databases and Node.js](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/05/24/Partitioned-Databases-with-Cloudant-Libraries.html) in this blog article that includes how to create a partitioned database, search, views, and a global index.\n2.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00469-13046-15136", "score": 14.141206, "text": "\nYou might find that you\u2019re mainly hitting the Query limit, but you have plenty of headroom in Lookups. It might be possible to reduce the reliance on Queries through some remodeling of the data or perhaps doing more work client-side.\n\nThe corollary here though is that you can\u2019t assume that any third-party library or framework optimizes for cost ahead of convenience. Client-side frameworks that support multiple persistence layers by using plug-ins are unlikely to be aware of this situation, or might be incapable of making such tradeoffs.\n\nChecking for third-party library or framework compatibility before you commit to a particular tool is a good idea.\n\nIt is also worth understanding that the rates aren\u2019t directly equivalent to HTTP API endpoint calls. You must expect that, for example, a bulk update counts according to its constituent document writes.\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant documentation on [plans and pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public) on IBM public cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Logging helps you see what\u2019s going on \n\nIBM Cloudant\u2019s logs indicating each API call made, what was requested and how long it took to respond can be automatically spooled to LogDNA for analysis and reporting for IBM Cloud-based services.

Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions. For more information, see the section on [partitioned tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogpartitioned).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09950-7-1844", "score": 16.217876, "text": "\nTables \n\nIn the table from the Tables tab, the value that is displayed in the row count column is an approximate.

For all these reasons, it is important to pick the appropriate data type.\n3. Specify whether Not null is true or false.\nA column that allows NULL values also allows rows to be inserted with no value in that column. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value.\n4. Specify the default value to be used if no value is specified when a row is inserted.\n5.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-64080-66194", "score": 20.160587, "text": "\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields.

CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-41116-43256", "score": 20.105576, "text": "\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list. It contains data that is sorted by the fields you specify, for example, books that are sorted by date and title. If you perform a query that asks for data that matches a document's date and title, the indexed data structure can be used to speed up the query process. Instead of scanning through every document in turn, IBM Cloudant can jump to the relevant part of the index (say, the section on 20th century books) and retrieve the data much more quickly.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query indexes include two types of indexes: type=json and type=text. These indexes are backed by two underlying indexing technologies that we meet in subsequent parts of this course.\n\nAn index is defined when you POST some JSON to a database's _index endpoint.\n\nThe index object contains a fields array, which specifies which document attributes to index. Usually, the fields that need indexing are equivalent to the attributes used in the selector of a query you're going to use to retrieve the data. That is, if you need to query by the date field, we need to index the date field.\n\nAlthough the name of an index is optional, it's good practice and we follow this convention. It's good to ask IBM Cloudant a question and specify the name of the index you intend it to use. This practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard. Select the database, then choose the Design Documents tab and Query Indexes from the menu.\n\nAny existing indexes are listed on the side: A special index must exist that represents the primary index, based on the document's _id.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-42802-44973", "score": 20.090433, "text": "\nThis practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard. Select the database, then choose the Design Documents tab and Query Indexes from the menu.\n\nAny existing indexes are listed on the side: A special index must exist that represents the primary index, based on the document's _id.\n\nComplete the index definition with the JSON:\n\nClick Create Index when you're done.\n\nClicking the button sends a POST request to the _index endpoint (other API calls are available to update and delete existing indexes).\n\nIndexes are built asynchronously by IBM Cloudant in the background. For large databases, it can take IBM Cloudant some time to construct the index for the first time. The index cannot use the database until that initial build is ready.\n\nWe can repeat our query for books in the 20th century. This time we specify the index name with the use_index field. The answer returns - this time powered by our index. You might not notice a speed improvement for a small database, but the benefit is definitely felt as your data size and query volume grows. Indexing helps your queries remain performant as your application scales.\n\nWhen you tell IBM Cloudant to create a secondary index, it starts a background task that looks at all the documents in turn and creates a new data structure on disk: the index. The index is a balanced tree which pairs the keys (the attribute or attributes that you need indexed) with the document _id they came from.\n\nThe index can be used to efficiently lookup known keys and ranges of keys without having to rescan the entire database.\n\nAnother trick that you can employ at index time is the partial filter. You can optionally supply a partial filter in your index definition. This IBM Cloudant Query selector is executed at index time to decide which documents' data makes it to the index and which are ignored.\n\nIn this example, a selector is employed that allows only dates that fall on a weekend to make it to the index. Smaller indexes are faster and more efficient.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00539-7-1755", "score": 20.070543, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloudant Query FAQ \n\n[IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query) is an API for querying slices of data based on the values of a database's document attributes. It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00522-7-1725", "score": 19.90528, "text": "\nDigging deeper into IBM Cloudant Dashboard \n\nThe IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Dashboard gives new and experienced IBM Cloudant users the opportunity to add, edit, and delete documents.

Create some sample data that represents a book in a library as shown in the following example:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"BXP9G5ZQY9Q4EA13\",\n\"author\": \"Dickens\",\n\"title\": \"David Copperfield\",\n\"year\": 1840,\n\"pages\": 723,\n\"publisher\": \"Penguin\",\n\"url\": \"https://www.somurl.com/dc\"\n}\n3. Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3. A report that details the number of books that are published by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

The provider\u2019s high-use SaaS systems, which held both patient record systems and business report apps, needed updates frequently. Yet, the provider's developers were overwhelmed with administering the hardware, network, and even the Kubernetes stack on their own. The provider also wanted to counteract increasing labor costs and a decreasing budget.\n\nThey started by containerizing their SaaS systems and putting them in the cloud. From that first step, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the SaaS apps, they easily designed Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. They used IBM Cloud Pak for Data to provide the familiar analytics tools from their on-prem environment. Another factor for decreased staff costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the provider can focus on delivering better customer service.\n\nAccelerated development is a key win for the IT Exec. With the move to public cloud, Developers can experiment easily with Node.js SDK, pushing changes to Development and Test systems, scaled out on separate clusters.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API. The core network services that are offered by NSX are:\n\n\n\n Logical switches \n\nA cloud deployment or a virtual data center might have various applications across multiple tenants.

You can use Hyper-V to customize the system resources for each virtual machine, including memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n How much RAM does a virtual machine need? \n\nRAM needs vary based on requirements for the virtual machine. Check the system requirements for your guest operating system. The amount of memory that is provided to a virtual machine can be changed at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can a virtual machine access to more than one processor? \n\nYou can grant a virtual machine access to multiple processors with any Windows virtual machine.

Virtual machines can connect to both a public and private network.\n\n\n\n\n\n What advantages are there to providing private network access to virtual machines? \n\nProviding private network access to virtual machines allows virtual machines to communicate with each other. Private network access also allows virtual machines to communicate with other internal systems such as NAS and iSCSI and any other servers that you have with IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can virtual machines use the secondary IP block that came with the server? \n\nNo. The secondary IP that was provided with your server is routed specifically to work on the physical server and not a virtual machine.

For existing accounts, provisioning scripts are managed within the IBM Cloud\u00ae console. During the ordering process, you can manually enter scripts for new accounts or scripts that are not yet tracked.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a cloud-init enabled image and provide user data to automatically perform configuration tasks or run scripts. For more information, see [Provisioning with a cloud-init enabled image](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/image-templates?topic=image-templates-provisioning-with-a-cloud-init-enabled-image).\n\nDuring the provisioning process, scripts that are associated with an HTTP URL are downloaded to the device. After provisioning, an administrator must run the script manually on the device. Scripts that are associated with an HTTPS URL are downloaded and run automatically. Provisioning scripts are currently available on only Linux operating systems (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Debian, or Ubuntu), and Windows and FreeBSD. The provisioning script can be any type of file that is run by the operating system, including combined binary files or any OS supported language.\n\nFor more information, see [Managing a provisioning script](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-a-provisioning-scriptmanaging-a-provisioning-script).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-provisioning-scripts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14050-6191-8276", "score": 10.741738, "text": "\nProvision script Provisioning scripts are commonly used to apply a customer-specific configuration to a server and to aid in automation of your scaling strategy.

When you develop the app, the resources it uses are in the same zone, or otherwise closely connected in a multizone, so that you can make assumptions about latency, bandwidth, or correlated failures.

Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per core, such as 10. - Avoid node overload: Similarly, just because a node can contain more than 100 pods doesn't mean that you want it to. Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per node, such as 40. - Don't tap out your cluster bandwidth**: Keep in mind that network bandwidth on scaling virtual machines is around 1000 Mbps. If you need hundreds of worker nodes in a cluster, split it up into multiple clusters with fewer nodes, or order bare metal nodes. - Sorting out your services: Plan out how many services that you need for your workload before you deploy. Networking and port forwarding rules are put into Iptables. If you anticipate a larger number of services, such as more than 5,000 services, split up the cluster into multiple clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n Provision different types of machines for a mix of computing resources \n\nEveryone likes choices, right? With Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, you have [a mix of flavors](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-planning_worker_nodesplanning_worker_nodes) that you can deploy: from bare metal for intensive workloads to virtual machines for rapid scaling.

For instance:\n\nwhisk.baseURL = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n\nIn this example, you use an installation that is running at http://localhost:8080.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift.

'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift.

For many, the graphic user interface (GUI) relegated your computer's command-line interface to second-class status. But now, it's time to bring it back (although the GUI isn't going away anytime soon, especially when we need to browse the web to download instructions for the command-line toolset).\n\nOpen a shell and create a directory.

See the following descriptions:\n\n\n\n1. At index-time, choose the {store: true} option. This option indicates that the field you're dealing with needs to be stored inside the index. A field can be \"stored\" even if it isn't used for indexing itself. For example, you might want to \"store\" a telephone number, even if your search algorithm doesn't include searching by phone number.\n2. At query-time, pass ?include_docs=true to indicate to IBM Cloud that you want the entire body of each matching document to be returned.\n\n\n\nThe first option means you have a larger index, but it's the fastest way of retrieving data. The second option keeps the index small, but adds extra query-time work for IBM Cloud as it must fetch document bodies after the search result set is calculated. This process can be slower to run and adds a further burden to the IBM Cloud cluster.\n\nIf possible, choose the first option use the following guidelines:\n\n\n\n* Index only the fields that you want to be searchable.\n* Store only the fields that you need to retrieve at query-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Entity extraction \n\nProviding a good search experience depends on the alignment of your users' search needs with structure in the data. Running lots of unstructured data with an indexing engine gets you only so far. If you can add further structure to unstructured data, then the search experience benefits since fewer \"false positives\" are returned. Look at this example:\n\n\"Edinson Cavani scored two superb goals as Uruguay beat Portugal to set up a World Cup quarter-final meeting with France.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-search-analyzers"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16340-6633-8736", "score": 9.888243, "text": "\nMost online data sources provide self-referencing public URLs for objects in the store to support direct access.

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call.

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region.

You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-failover"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16321-20604-22275", "score": 15.611371, "text": "\n\"message\": \"Sorry, I could not find an agent.\"\n},\n\"message_to_human_agent\": \"The caller needs help resetting their password\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Transferring upon failure \n\nTo configure transfer on failures, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings.

If User-to-User is specified in the transfer_headers list, the session history key is sent in the X-Watson-Assistant-Session-History-Key header.\n\nThe value of the SIP header is limited to 1024 bytes.\n\nHow this data is presented in the SIP REFER message also depends on the value of transfer_headers_send_method(as defined in [Generic Service Desk SIP Parameters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsgeneric-service-desk-sip-parameters)).\n\nThe following example shows the data included as headers:\n\nREFER sip:b@atlanta.example.com SIP/2.0\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP agenta.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK2293940223\nTo: <sip:b@atlanta.example.com>\nFrom: <sip:a@atlanta.example.com>;tag=193402342\nCall-ID: 898234234@agenta.atlanta.example.com\nCSeq: 23 REFER\nMax-Forwards: 7\nRefer-To: sip:user@domain.com", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"}]}

This strategy includes workloads in both the private cloud and multiple external cloud environments, such as the public cloud or a cloud managed by a service provider. Most enterprises are also faced with the challenge of protecting an ever-increasing attack surface while simultaneously maintaining compliance with industry and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nTo protect this expanding attack surface, enterprises need continuous visibility into workloads from the start until the end of their lifecycle. Enterprises must maintain a \u201cfull-stack\u201d understanding of the workload vulnerabilities and configuration issues at the infrastructure, platform, and application level in the context of threats and compliance requirements. Enterprises need predictive analytics to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d to give a proactive view of their cyberrisk and compliance risk posture in this vast, new hybrid world.\n\nCaveonix RiskForesight\u2122 provides proactive workload protection from risks due to cyberthreats and regulatory compliance issues. It provides real-time visibility into what is running in an enterprise\u2019s hybrid cloud through native integration into cloud orchestration platforms. Combining such visibility with risk reduction models and enforcement actions that can be automated, RiskForesight quickly develops a prioritized list of actions to mitigate. RiskForesight is a multitenant-aware hybrid cloud workload protection platform that implements a proactive risk management framework. This framework can operate at multiple control planes: network, compute, security, and compliance, while the implementation of the framework at cloud scale is automated.\n\nThe platform is fully integrated into the VMware\u00ae technology stack from vCD, vRA, vCenter to NSX and many public clouds. The RiskForesight platform has three key modules: Detect, Predict, and Act, providing 360-degree visibility into hybrid cloud workloads in real time by natively integrating into hybrid cloud orchestration modules.

This document gives some details.\n\n\n\n  What is a Web Application Firewall? \n\nA WAF helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet. A WAF is an OSI protocol Layer-7 defense in the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), and it is not designed to defend against all types of attacks.\n\nDeploying a WAF in front of a web application is like placing a shield between the web application and the internet. A proxy server protects a client machine\u2019s identity by using an intermediary (for outgoing traffic), but a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy that protects the server from exposure by having the client's traffic pass through the WAF before reaching the server (for incoming traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Types of attacks WAF can prevent \n\nA WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others. A WAF usually is part of a suite of tools, which together can create a holistic defense against a range of attack vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How a WAF works \n\nA WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic.\n\nThe value of a WAF comes from the speed and ease with which its policy modifications can be implemented, thereby allowing a faster response to varying attack vectors. For example, during a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), rate limiting can be implemented by modifying WAF policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Key benefits of a CIS WAF \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services WAF is an easy way to set up, manage, and customize security rules to protect your web applications from common web threats. See the following list for key features:\n\n\n\n*  Easy setup - The CIS WAF is part of our overall service, which takes just a few minutes to set up. After you redirect your DNS to us, you can switch on the WAF and set up the rules you need.\n*  Detailed reporting - See greater detail in the reporting, for example, threats blocked by rule/rule group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-waf-q-and-a"}]}

By scheduling automatic rotation of your secrets at regular intervals, you can reduce the likelihood of compromise and ensure that your credentials never expire.\n\nAutomatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager. If the secret was imported initially, you must provide new secret data to rotate it. For more information, see [Manually rotating secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotation).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you get started, be sure that you have the required level of access. To rotate secrets, you need the [Writer service role or higher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam).\n\n\n\n Supported secret types \n\nAutomatic rotation is supported for [private certificates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-certificatescreate-certificates), [public certificates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-certificatesorder-certificates), [user credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-user-credentials) and [IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).

Credentials are service-specific and vary based on how each service defines the credentials they need to generate. A credential might contain a user name, password, host name, port, and a URL.\n\nHowever, while the contents of each credential is unique to the service that generates it, all services managed by IAM require that new credentials include an IAM Service access role. Some services might generate more data that requires parameters to be passed in. For example, a service might require you to input a language parameter to set the default language that is returned in the resource key that is generated.\n\nTo create a resource key, call the [Resource Controller API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controllercreate-resource-key) as shown in the following example:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Python\n* Go\n* Node", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13071-11839-12907", "score": 16.284433, "text": "\nIf the intention that the credential be used to grant, access to a subset of buckets and not the entire instance, this policy needs to be edited.

However, all users must have the correct level of access to see the details of a credential including the API key value. The access of the user must be equal to or greater than that of the service credential.

The following sections include typical examples. For a more detailed discussion of Serverless architecture, example use cases, pros and cons discussion, and implementation best practices, read the excellent [Mike Roberts article on Martin Fowler's blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html).\n\n\n\n Microservices \n\nDespite their benefit, microservice-based solutions remain difficult to build by using mainstream cloud technologies, often requiring control of a complex toolchain, and separate build and operations pipelines. Small and agile teams waste too much time with infrastructural and operational complexities such as fault-tolerance, load balancing, auto scaling, and logging. These teams want a way to develop streamlined, value-added code with programming languages they already know, love, and that are best suited to solve particular problems.\n\nThe modular and inherently scalable nature of Cloud Functions makes it ideal for implementing granular pieces of logic in actions. Cloud Functions actions are independent of each other and can be implemented by using various different languages that are supported by Cloud Functions and access various backend systems. Each action can be independently deployed and managed, is scaled independently of other actions. Interconnectivity between actions is provided by Cloud Functions in the form of rules, sequences, and naming conventions. This type of environment bodes well for microservices based applications.\n\nAnother important argument in favor of Cloud Functions is the cost of a system in a disaster recovery configuration. Compare microservices with PaaS or CaaS verses using Cloud Functions by assuming that you have 10 microservices, which use containers or Cloud Foundry runtimes. This comparison equates to 10 continuously running and billable processes in a single availability zone, 20 when run across 2 availability zones, and 40 when run across two regions with two zones each. To achieve the same goal with Cloud Functions, you can run them across as many availability zones or regions as you like, without having to pay a penny of incremental costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Web apps \n\nGiven Cloud Functions\u2019s event-driven nature, it offers several benefits for user-facing applications, whereas the HTTP requests coming from the user\u2019s browser serve as the events.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00007-7-2159", "score": 17.643806, "text": "\nGetting started tutorial \n\nIBM Analytics Engine Serverless instance is allocated to compute and memory resources on demand when Spark workloads are deployed.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS.

A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 14.373378, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04146-2946-5057", "score": 12.592393, "text": "\nAvailable Cloudflare fields\n\n Field name Type Example value Notes \n\n cf.client.bot Boolean true This field indicates whether the request is coming from a known bot or crawler, regardless of good or bad intent. \n cf.threat_score Number A 0-100 value This field represents a risk score, 0 indicates low risk as determined by Cloudflare.

For example, you might use the benchmark in an audit to confirm that basic security measures are in place, and to identify areas where you might enhance your security.\n\n\n\n What does the benchmark cover? \n\nThe benchmark covers recommendations for master components, etcd, control plane configurations, worker nodes, and policies such as for users, network, and pod security.\n\n\n\n\n\n What do the benchmark recommendations mean? \n\nThe benchmark recommendations have scoring, levels, result status, and responsibilities as follows.\n\n\n\n* Scoring\n\n\n\n* Scored: The overall benchmark score increases or decreases depending on whether the recommendation is met.\n* Not scored: The overall benchmark score is not impacted, whether the recommendation is met.\n\n\n\n* Levels\n\n\n\n* Level 1: Practical security measures that can be configured without inhibiting the service.\n* Level 2: More in-depth security measures that might reduce the performance or functionality of a service.\n\n\n\n* Result\n\n\n\n* Pass: The service complies with the benchmark recommendation.\n* Fail: The service does not comply with the benchmark recommendation by default. Refer to the remediation section for an explanation and possible actions that you can take to comply with the benchmark recommendation.\n\n\n\n* Responsibility\n\n\n\n* IBM: IBM is responsible for configuring the setting that the benchmark recommends.\n* Shared: You and IBM share responsibility for configuring the setting that the benchmark recommends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What parts of the benchmark am I responsible for? \n\nBecause IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is a managed offering, IBM already configures many security settings for you. For example, IBM manages and automatically applies updates to your cluster master. For your worker nodes, IBM provides security and version updates, but you must apply the updates.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

This type of model can adapt as the amount of data grows.\n* Rule-based model: Uses a declarative approach to finding entities in documents. This type of model is more predictable, and is easier to comprehend and maintain. However, it does not learn from new data. It can only find patterns it has been taught to look for.\n\n\n\nYou can also create one workspace that contains both one rule-based model and one machine learning model.\n* What services will use the model?\n\nSee [Watson services integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-wks_overview_fullwks_watsoninteg) for information about the other Watson services that custom models can be used with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo create a workspace, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "score": 17.704947, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

Do not redact the information or replace it wholesale with variables. For best results, replace the real information with fake information of the same type.\n\nFor example, if the PII that you want to protect is client names, then instead of redacting each name or replacing each name with a variable, such as USER_NAME, replace each name with a fake name that uses a variety of typical name syntax styles, such as Jane Doe, Mr. Smith, Dietrich, or Dr. Jones, PhD. Consider writing a script that concatenates a variety of first and last names, and titles and last names, and adds last names alone to create fake names that can be inserted into the document to replace instances of real user names. The goal is to simulate as closely as possible real values in the source documents. If the same text (USER_NAME) is used in the documents or text is redacted, you will basically be training the model to expect all names to have that same value or be redacted.

Each worker node that you add in a cluster is deployed with a private IP address from the VPC subnet in that zone. After the worker node is provisioned, the worker node IP address persists after a reboot operation, but the worker node IP address changes after replace and update operations.\n\nSubnets provide a channel for connectivity among the worker nodes within the cluster. Additionally, any system that is connected to any of the private subnets in the same VPC can communicate with workers. For example, all subnets in one VPC can communicate through private layer 3 routing with a built-in VPC router. If you have multiple clusters that must communicate with each other, you can create the clusters in the same VPC. However, if your clusters don't need to communicate, you can achieve better network segmentation by creating the clusters in separate VPCs.

To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.

If you use a custom domain, you can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination.\n* [Re-encrypt package before you forward it to upstream apps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-comm-ingress-annotationsssl-services-support): The ALB decrypts HTTPS requests before forwarding traffic to your apps. If you have apps that require HTTPS and need traffic to be encrypted before it is forwarded to those upstream apps, you can use the ssl-services annotation.

This simplified model is based on the amount of CPU (or VPC) that your IBM Blockchain Platform nodes are allocated on an hourly basis, at a flat rate of $0.29 USD/VPC-hour.\n\nA VPC is a unit of measurement that is used to determine the licensing cost of IBM products.

Your data is protected while at rest, and also in transit from the storage to the hypervisor and host. You are responsible for encrypting your data outside the VPC.\n\nWith customer-managed encryption, you can bring your own customer root key (CRK) to the cloud or have a [key management service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutkms-for-byok) (KMS) generate a key for you.

In general, all component backups:\n\n\n\n* are encrypted\n* are taken daily\n* are stored in a separate data center\n* are saved for 30 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Database Backup Retention \n\nDatabase backups will be retained for the standard duration of 14 days for Production environments and 7 days for Non-Production environments. In scenarios where the customer would like to retain a backup for longer than the standard duration outlined, the IBM SRE team will perform a database backup and save it to the COS bucket. It will then be the responsibility of the customer to download and maintain these backups. If a restore using one of these downloaded backups is required, the customer will need to upload the backup back to the COS bucket and open a case specifying which backup to use and for which environment they would like the restore.\n\n\n\n\n\n Restore \n\nRestore requests must be submitted via case (ticket) through the IBM Support Community Portal. The expected turn around time will depend on the severity and the size of the restore required. Generally for non-production systems, expect 1 - 3 days for a restore to happen. Database restore can only be done to one of the previous daily backups (cannot restore to point in time).\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster Recovery \n\nIn the event of a DR issue with the Maximo Application Suite Dedicated Service offering for a specific customer, IBM's focus will be in the following order:\n\n\n\n1.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-187656-189537", "score": 21.382252, "text": "\nA Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides network isolation and security in the IBM Cloud.

In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and IBM Cloud service on the private backbone.

VPCs give an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\n\nImagine that a cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure is a residential apartment building and multiple families live inside. Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium; no one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission. A VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to manually provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

Service IDs are used to provide a separate identity for services and applications.

You can create a service ID to be used by an application that needs access to your IBM Cloud services so that individual user credentials don't need to be used.\n\n\n\n Service ID API keys \n\nYou can also create API keys that are associated with service IDs to authenticate applications as a particular service ID. This way, the applications can access resources that are assigned to that specific service ID. Service ID API key credentials can be used to make API and CLI calls.

With trusted profiles, it is possible for a user to complete the actions without being invited to an account. Instead, they are automatically granted access to resources when they apply the trusted profile identity during login. Only users federated by an external IdP can be mapped to trusted profiles during login by evaluating SAML-based attributes to determine which profiles their identity can apply.\n\nSimilarly, instead of creating a service ID, generating an API key, and getting the application to store and validate that key, you can create [trusted profiles for compute resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile) to define fine-grained authorization for all applications that are running in a compute resource.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own.

A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value.

It contains a condition that must be met for the node to be processed by your assistant. At a minimum, it also contains a response. For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response. You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more. (If you want to learn more about complex dialogs, you can complete the [Building a complex dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial) tutorial.)\n\nThe node that you will add in this step is one that contains slots. Slots provide a structured format through which you can ask for and save multiple pieces of information from a user within a single node.

For example, you might group nodes that address questions about user accounts in a User account folder and nodes that handle payment-related queries in a Payment folder.\n* To group together a set of nodes that you want the dialog to process only if a certain condition is met. Use a condition, such as $isPlatinumMember, for example, to group together nodes that offer extra services that should only be processed if the current user is entitled to receive the extra services.\n* To hide nodes from the runtime while you work on them. You can add the nodes to a folder with a false condition to prevent them from being processed.\n\n\n\nThese characteristics of the folder impact how the nodes in a folder are processed:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If no condition is specified, then your assistant processes the nodes within the folder directly.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasks"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-4-2102", "score": 17.531542, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\nFor more information about these built-in nodes, see [Starting and ending the dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-start).\n2.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}]}

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support.

The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "score": 14.30505, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02961-7-1871", "score": 15.954366, "text": "\nDialog building tips \n\nGet tips about ways to address common tasks.\n\n\n\n Adding nodes \n\n\n\n* Add a node name that describes the purpose of the node.\n\nYou currently know what the node does, but months from now you might not.

Due to the similarity of the structure of this sentence to the user example that you annotated (I want to buy a Coach bag), your assistant recognizes Gucci bag as a @product entity mention.\n\nWhen a contextual entity model is used for an entity, your assistant does not look for exact text or pattern matches for the entity in the user input, but focuses instead on the context of the sentence in which the entity is mentioned.\n\nIf you choose to define entity values by using annotations, add at least 10 annotations per entity to give the contextual entity model enough data to be reliable.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about contextual entities, [read this blog post](https://medium.com/ibm-watson/contextual-entities-with-ibm-watson-assistant-f41b2e0ca82e).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating entities \n\n\n\n1. Open your dialog skill and then click the Entities tab.\n\nv1.3: Click the Entities tab.\n\nYou can also click System entities to select from a list of common entities, provided by IBM, that can be applied to any use case. See [Enabling system entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-entitiesentities-enable-system-entities) for more detail.\n2. Click Create entity.\n3. In the Entity name field, type a descriptive name for the entity.\n\nThe entity name can contain letters (in Unicode), numbers, underscores, and hyphens.

With the introduction of rich response types, the output.text structure was augmented with the output.generic structure to facilitate supporting other types of responses in addition to text. Use the new format when you create new nodes to give yourself more flexibility, because you can subsequently change the response type, if needed.\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"text\": {\n\"values\": [\n\"This is my response text.\"\n]\n}\n}\n}\n\nThere are response types other than a text response that you can define.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-context"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02961-4288-6011", "score": 18.55036, "text": "\nSee [Expression language methods for String](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-methodsdialog-methods-strings) to learn about more methods you can use.\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks. I want to open a savings account and apply for a credit card. How does the dialog recognize and address both of them? See the [Compound questions](https://sodoherty.ai/2017/02/06/compound-questions/) entry from Simon O'Doherty's blog for strategies you can try. (Simon is a developer on the Watson Assistant team.)\n* Dealing with ambiguous intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish that is ambiguous enough that your assistant finds two or more nodes with intents that could potentially address it. How does the dialog know which dialog branch to follow? If you enable disambiguation, it can show users their options and ask the user to pick the correct one. See [Disambiguation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity. But, using @appliance:(air conditioner) gets expanded to entity['appliance'].contains('air conditioner'), which matches whenever there is at least one @appliance entity of value 'air conditioner' detected in the user input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Condition usage tips", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tips"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-169391-171464", "score": 18.438301, "text": "\nSee [Digressions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-digressions) for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12 July 2018 \n\nRich response types\n: You can now add rich responses that include elements such as images or buttons in addition to text, to your dialog. See [Rich responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multimedia) for more information.\n\nContextual entities (Beta)\n: Contextual entities are entities that you define by labeling mentions of the entity type that occur in intent user examples. These entity types teach your assistant not only terms of interest, but also the context in which terms of interest typically appear in user utterances, enabling your assistant to recognize never-seen-before entity mentions based solely on how they are referenced in user input. For example, if you annotate the intent user example, I want a flight to Boston by labeling Boston as a @destination entity, then your assistant can recognize Chicago as a @destination mention in a user input that says, I want a flight to Chicago. This feature is currently available for English only. See [Adding contextual entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entitiesentities-create-annotation-based) for more information.\n\nWhen you access the tool with an Internet Explorer web browser, you cannot label entity mentions in intent user examples nor edit user example text.\n\nEntity recommendations\n: Watson can now recommend synonyms for your entity values. The recommender finds related synonyms based on contextual similarity extracted from a vast body of existing information, including large sources of written text, and uses natural language processing techniques to identify words similar to the existing synonyms in your entity value. For more information see [Synonyms](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entitiesentities-create-dictionary-based).\n\nNew API version\n: The current API version is now 2018-07-10.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03043-7-2031", "score": 21.704922, "text": "\nAdding a skill to your assistant \n\nCustomize your assistant by adding to it the skills it needs to satisfy your customers' goals.\n\nYou can create the following types of skills:\n\n\n\n* Dialog skill: Uses Watson natural language processing and machine learning technologies to understand user questions and requests, and respond to them with answers that are authored by you.\n* Search skill: For a given user query, uses the IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to search a data source of your self-service content and return an answer.\n\n\n\nTypically, you create a skill of each type first. Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

You provide information about the subjects or tasks that your users need help with, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n* Actions skill : Offers a simple interface where anyone can build a conversational flow for your assistant to follow. The complex process of training data creation occurs behind the scenes automatically. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-addskill-add-actions-skill)\n* Dialog skill: Offers a set of editors that you use to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree. You use the graphical dialog editor to create a script of sorts for your assistant to read from when it interacts with your customers. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses.

Previously, the original confidence score of the option was used.\n\nSkill import improvements\n: Importing of large skills from JSON data is now processed in the background. When you import a JSON file to create a skill, the new skill tile appears immediately.

The product applies data analysis and cognitive intuition to enrich your data such that you can more easily find and retrieve meaningful information from it later. To read more about Discovery, see the [product documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-about).\n\nTypically, the type of data collection you add to Discovery and access from your assistant contains information that is owned by your company.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-search-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03126-5596-6966", "score": 15.035664, "text": "\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-74273-76338", "score": 14.444349, "text": "\n: Try the new autolearning beta feature to empower your skill to improve itself automatically over time.

Then, [update the worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-updateworker_node) in your cluster.\n\nWorker nodes can run later patch versions than the master, such as patch versions that are specific to worker nodes for security updates.\n\nHow are patch updates applied?\n: By default, patch updates for the master are applied automatically over the course of several days, so a master patch version might show up as available before it is applied to your master. The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another. In any of these cases, you can [check the versions change log](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog) for any potential impact and choose to safely use the ibmcloud ks cluster master update[command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_cluster_update) yourself without waiting for the update automation to apply.\n\nUnlike the master, you must update your workers for each patch version.\n\nWhat happens during the master update?\n: Your master is highly available with three replica master pods.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05653-95381-96778", "score": 23.454533, "text": "\nUpdate your cluster to at least [version 1.20](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions_120) as soon as possible.\n\nMaster fix pack and worker node fix pack update\n: Change log documentation is available for Kubernetes version [1.22.2_1522 and 1.22.2_1523](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog_1221222_1522_and_1222_1523).\n\n\n\n\n\n 27 September 2021 \n\nMaster fix pack update\n: Change log documentation is available for version [1.21.5_1531](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog_1211215_1531), [1.20.11_1553](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog_12012011_1553), [1.19.15_1560](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog_11911915_1560), [1.18.20_1565](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-118_changelog11820_1565).\n\nWorker node fix pack update\n: Change log documentation is available for version [1.18.20_1566](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-118_changelog11820_1566), [1.19.15_1561](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog_11911915_1561), [12011_1554](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog_12012011_1554), and [1.21.5_1532](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog_1211215_1532).\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 September 2021 \n\nReview the release notes for 23 September 2021.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-containers-relnotes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10392-102583-103538", "score": 23.244804, "text": "\nUpdate your cluster to at least [version 4.6](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_versions) as soon as possible.\n\nMaster fix pack and worker node fix pack update\n: Change log documentation is available for OpenShift version [4.8.11_1526_openshift and 4.8.12_1527_openshift](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_48).\n\n\n\n\n\n 27 September 2021 \n\nMaster fix pack update\n: Change log documentation is available for version [4.7.30_1532_openshift](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_474730_1532),[4.6.44_1556_openshift](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_464644_1556), [4.5.41_1552_openshift](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-changelog_archive4541_1552), and [3.11.521_1604_openshift](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_changelog_311311521_1604).\n\nWorker node fix pack update", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-relnotes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10394-1469-2994", "score": 23.099926, "text": "\nIf you are updating your worker nodes to a new major version, such as from 4.11 to 4.12, update the cluster master first.\n\nibmcloud oc cluster master update --cluster CLUSTER [--version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] [--force-update] [-f] [-q]\n\nExample command:\n\nibmcloud oc cluster master update --cluster mycluster --version 4.11.42 --force-update\n2.

They created clusters for a Development environment that allow worldwide Developers to collaboratively deploy app improvements quickly.\n\nSecurity first: The Development Exec chose bare metal to host the research clusters. With bare metal for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, the sensitive research workloads now have familiar isolation but within the flexibility of public cloud.

For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted.

Those deployments are accelerated with familiar open source tools, already part of IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nThey started by containerizing the analysis apps and putting them in the cloud. In a flash, their hardware headaches went away. They were able to easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their high-performance CPU, RAM, storage, and security needs. And when their analysis apps change, they can add or shrink compute without huge hardware investments. With the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

Typically, text can't be extracted from embedded fonts that don't map to unicode characters.

If you do not see the same characters that are visible in the PDF itself, then the text extraction would likely fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n Formatted documents \n\nWhen formatted documents are converted to plain text, it's possible that losing the formatting could result in poor tokenization of words. For example, if a table row in a DOCX file contains cell values that do not end with a period, the values might be converted as one sentence. As another example, if a PDF document contains a very long word that is hyphenated at the end of a line, that word might be converted as two words.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}]}

Now the model is immutable. To add an order, I create a new order document in the database, which cannot generate conflicts.\n\nTo be able to retrieve all orders for a specific customer, we can employ a view, which we cover later.\n\nAvoid constructs that rely on updates to parts of existing documents, where possible. Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"}]}

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Pricing is based on the aggregate number of minutes of audio that you recognize per month:\n\n\n\n* Users who recognize 1 to 999,999 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.02 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n* Users who recognize at least 1,000,000 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.01 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n\n\n\nThe Plus plan is intended for small businesses. It is also a good choice for large enterprises that want to develop and test larger applications before considering moving to a Premium plan. For more information, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I continue to use the Speech to Text Standard plan? \n\nThe Standard plan is no longer available for purchase by new users.

Their API settings and custom models remain unaffected.\n\nExisting users can also choose to upgrade to the new Plus plan by visiting the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

When the service instance is deleted, a 7-day reclamation period begins. During that time, you are able to restore the instance and all of the associated user data. However, if the instance and data are permanently deleted, it cannot be restored. App Configuration does not store any data from permanently deleted instances.\n\nThe App Configuration data retention policy describes how long your data is stored after you delete the service. The data retention policy is included in the App Configuration service description, which you can find in the [IBM Cloud Terms and Notices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-terms).\n\n\n\n Deleting an instance \n\nIf you no longer need an instance of App Configuration, you can delete the service instance and any data that is stored using ibmcloud CLI. You can also choose to delete your service instance by using the console.\n\nTo restore a deleted instance or to delete the instance permanently you can use Resource Reclamations.

With the Hyper Protect Crypto Services key management service API, you can provide the first authorization by [setting the key for deletion](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-delete-dual-auth-keysset-key-deletion-api). Then, a different user provides a second authorization by using the IBM Cloud console or key management service API to delete the key.\n\nBefore you delete a key by using dual authorization:\n\n\n\n* Determine who can authorize deletion of your Hyper Protect Crypto Services resources. To use dual authorization, be sure to identify a user who can set the key for deletion, and another user who can delete the key. Users with a Writer or Manager access policy can set keys for deletion. Users with a Manager access policy can delete keys.\n* Plan to delete the key within a 7-day waiting period. When the first user authorizes a key for deletion, Hyper Protect Crypto Services sets a 7-day waiting period on the key.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-delete-dual-auth-keys"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08211-1158-3123", "score": 18.23134, "text": "\nibmcloud hpvs instance-delete CRN --force\n\n\n\nWhere CRN is Cloud resource name of the server you want to delete.

The server is deleted after the reclamation period ends. During this seven-day reclamation period, you can restore the virtual server, or manually trigger a deletion from [resource reclamations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resourceibmcloud_resource_reclamations). Resource reclamations lists the Hyper Protect Virtual Servers that are marked for deletion together with the time (Target time) when the actual deletion is triggered.\n\n\n\n\n\n Deleting servers that belong to the free plan \n\nThe free plan servers expire 30 days after they are created. When a server expires, it's immediately deleted at the backend. The server is also deleted at the backend if it expires during the seven-day reclamation period. Even though the server is deleted at the backend, it's still displayed in the resource list or in the resource reclamations as if it still exists.\n\nIf the server has expired, you can remove the entry from the resource list and either:\n\n\n\n* Wait for the target time to trigger deletion for you, or\n* Manually trigger the deletion from the resource reclamations.\n\n\n\nIf an expired server is restored, only the entry within the resource list is restored, not the server itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n Restoring servers that belong to paid plans \n\nServers that belong to a paid plans do not expire, and that's why they can be restored during the reclamation period.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-remove_vs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05025-9466-11403", "score": 18.11943, "text": "\nAs an admin, you might need to [restore a root key that you imported](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-restore-keys) to Hyper Protect Crypto Services so that you can access data that the key previously protected.

This must occur within 30 days of deleting a key.\n\nIf a key that was originally uploaded by a user is deleted, and then restored using different key material, it will result in a loss of data. It is recommended to keep n-5 keys archived somewhere in order to ensure that the correct key material is available for restoration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Activity Tracking \n\nWhen Hyper Protect Crypto Services root keys are deleted, rotated, suspended, enabled, or restored, an [Activity Tracker management event](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-at-eventsat-actions-global) (cloud-object-storage.bucket-key-state.update) is generated in addition to any events logged by Hyper Protect Crypto Services.\n\nIn the event of a server-side failure in a lifecycle action on a key, that failure is not logged by COS.

If you are unsure of who the registrar is for your domain, you can look it up at [whois.icann.org](https://whois.icann.org/).\n\nIf you delegate a subdomain (for instance, subdomain.example.com) from another DNS provider, you must replace the existing name server (NS) records and replace them with a name server record for each of the name servers that are provided by CIS.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04148-0-1895", "score": 17.477446, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Getting CIS running with a new subdomain \n\nFollow these steps to practice using CIS with a subdomain or CNAME.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server.

The TLS/SSL protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications.\n\nIn the context of web servers, the TLS/SSL protocol allows a website to establish the identity. Users of the website can be sure that no one else is masquerading as the website. It is done through a public-private key pair.\n\nHyper Protect Crypto Services provides a way to offload the cryptographic operations that are done during the TLS handshake to establish a secure connection to the web server, while it keeps the TLS/SSL private key securely stored in the dedicated HSM. In this way, you have control over your TLS/SSL keys and processing. As a result, security is improved and reputational risk is decreased.\n\nTLS/SSL offloading to the Hyper Protect Crypto Services HSM enables data in transit protection for web, API, and mobile transactions by using the standard PKCS #11 API. With Hyper Protect Crypto Services, you can integrate TLS/SSL offloading with other cloud proxies.\n\nFor a tutorial on how to offload the SSL workload to a load balancer such as NGINX while managing keys by using Hyper Protect Crypto Services, see [Using IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services to offload NGINX TLS](https://developer.ibm.com/components/ibmz/tutorials/use-hyper-protect-crypto-services-to-offload-nginx-tls/).\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-use-cases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07973-7-1958", "score": 11.782346, "text": "\nData encryption in transit \n\nData in transit must always be encrypted.

You might encounter the following terms while working with SSL certificates.\n\n\n\n Bit size \n\nEncryption keys are measured by their size in bits. For example, 512 bit, 1024 bit, 2048 bit. Generally, a longer key is going to be safer but slower to use. Currently, the minimum size for the keys that are used in SSL certificates is 1024 bit, though the Extended Validation certificates require 2048 bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n Certificate chain \n\nSSL certificates are not generally used alone. In most implementations, you deal with a certificate chain. For example:\n\nRoot > intermediate1 > server cert.\n\n> Intermediate2 > server2 cert\n\nIn this example, your server certificate is signed by the intermediate certificate, which is in turn signed by the root certificate. Chaining in this fashion can make SSL more secure because it means that the root certificate is not used (and exposed to risk) so often. If intermediate1 was compromised, then server cert might be in danger, but server2 cert would be fine because they are part of different chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n Certificate signing request \n\nThe certificate signing request (CSR) is a document that you generate on the server that contains information that the certificate authority uses to create your actual certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common name \n\nThe common name (CN) is the host name for which the certificate is valid (for example, www.domain.com).\n\nwww.domain.com, smtp.domain.com, and mail.domain.com are three different host names and the same SSL certificate is not valid for all three of them (unless you are using a wildcard certificate but currently IBM Cloud\u00ae does not offer those).\n\n\n\n\n\n Private/Public key \n\nSSL uses a technique called public key cryptography.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-introduction-to-ssl-technology"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-761220-763381", "score": 17.90488, "text": "\nThe website's URL is prefixed with \"HTTPS\" instead of \"HTTP\" and a padlock is shown on the address bar. If the website uses an extended validation (EV) certificate, the browser might also show a green address bar.\n* Why do I see a privacy warning?\n\nThe TLS certificates issued by IBM Cloud CIS cover the root domain (example.com) and one level of subdomain (.example.com). If you\u2019re trying to reach a second-level subdomain (..example.com) a privacy warning appears in your browser, because these host names are not added to the SAN.\n\nAllow up to 15 minutes for one of our partner Certificates Authorities (CAs) to issue a new certificate. A privacy warning appears in your browser if your new certificate has not yet been issued.\n* Why do I see invalid SSL certificate error?\n\nIf you see \"Error 526, Invalid SSL Certificate\" when visiting your site, it might mean your origin certificate is invalid. When the CIS proxy is enabled, a valid CA-signed certificate is required at the origin in the default SSL mode, which is \"End-to-end CA Signed\". Note that the default setting for the SSL mode was previously \"End-to-end Flexible\", which ignores the validity of certificates presented by the origin. The new default is applied only to newly added domains. If your domain was added when the default SSL mode was End-to-end Flexible, that setting is not overwritten. You can change the mode to a less strict mode, but that is not recommended for production environments.\n* What is DDoS?\n\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. In a DDoS attack, multiple compromised computer systems attack a target such as a server, website, or other network resource, affecting users of the targeted resource.\n\nThe flood of incoming messages, connection requests, or malformed packets to the target system forces it to slow down or even crash and shut down, thereby denying service to legitimate users or systems. DDoS attacks have been carried out by diverse threat actors, ranging from individual criminal hackers to organized crime rings and government agencies.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08766-9493-11228", "score": 17.863512, "text": "\n[Using IBM Db2 default encryption with Hyper Protect Crypto Services PKCS #11](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-tutorial-db2-pkcs11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Protecting data in transit with TLS/SSL offloading \n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are cryptographic protocols that are designed to provide communication security over a computer network. The TLS/SSL protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications.\n\nIn the context of web servers, the TLS/SSL protocol allows a website to establish the identity. Users of the website can be sure that no one else is masquerading as the website. It is done through a public-private key pair.\n\nHyper Protect Crypto Services provides a way to offload the cryptographic operations that are done during the TLS handshake to establish a secure connection to the web server, while it keeps the TLS/SSL private key securely stored in the dedicated HSM. In this way, you have control over your TLS/SSL keys and processing. As a result, security is improved and reputational risk is decreased.\n\nTLS/SSL offloading to the Hyper Protect Crypto Services HSM enables data in transit protection for web, API, and mobile transactions by using the standard PKCS #11 API. With Hyper Protect Crypto Services, you can integrate TLS/SSL offloading with other cloud proxies.\n\nFor a tutorial on how to offload the SSL workload to a load balancer such as NGINX while managing keys by using Hyper Protect Crypto Services, see [Using IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services to offload NGINX TLS](https://developer.ibm.com/components/ibmz/tutorials/use-hyper-protect-crypto-services-to-offload-nginx-tls/).\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-use-cases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04305-7-1913", "score": 17.7655, "text": "\nOrder an SSL certificate \n\nSecure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts traffic between the client application and the server application, and is accomplished by using a public key/private key system that uses an SSL certificate.\n\nSSL certificates contain the server\u2019s public key, dates for which the certificate is valid, a host name for which the certificate is valid, and a signature from the certificate authority that issued it.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae offers certificates that can be acquired and purchased without having to go through a third-party vendor/site.\n\nIBM Cloud offers yearly and bi-yearly SSL certificates for customers that offer various benefits, including:\n\n\n\n* Full authentication for business identity and domain ownership verification\n* 40- to 256-bit encryption on all online transactions\n* Daily website malware scanning to ensure that both your site and your customers are protected\n\n\n\nIf you are running multiple domains, an SSL certificate can be purchased for each domain.\n\nFor more information about SSL certificates refer to the following IBM Cloud articles:\n\n\n\n* [About SSL certificates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-about-ssl-certificates)\n* [Introduction to SSL technology](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-introduction-to-ssl-technology)\n* [Planning for SSL](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-planning-for-ssl)\n\n\n\nTo order an SSL certificate for use with your Citrix Netscaler VPX, perform the following procedure:\n\n\n\n1.

You can find the IP ranges used in the data centers in [this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).\n\nYou can allow data center access by placing the proper SERVICE-ALLOW rules at the beginning of the firewall rule sets with an action of accept. Where the rule set must be applied depends on the routing and firewall design being implemented.\n\nIt is recommended that you place the firewall rules in the location which causes the least duplication of work.

But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.\n\nGenerally, a type system that includes many entity types and relation types is open to more interpretation, thus inter-annotator agreement might be lower during the early phases of model development.

An inode is a data structure that contains information about files. Volumes have both private and public inodes. Public inodes are used for files that are visible to the customer and private inodes are used for files that are used internally by the storage system. The maximum number of files setting is 2 billion. However, this maximum value can be configured only with volumes of 7.8 TB or larger. The maximum number of inodes that can be configured on a volume is calculated by taking the total allocated volume size in KB and dividing it by 4.

When the volume is canceled, the request is followed by a 24-hour reclaim wait period. You can still see the volume in the console during those 24 hours. Billing for the volume stops immediately.

For example, to allow more bandwidth for volumes, you can apportion the previous example in equal allocations:\n\n\n\n* Volumes: 2,000 Mbps.\n* Network: 2,000 Mbps.\n\n\n\nHowever, before you change the volume/networking bandwidth ratio, be sure to evaluate your instance's network bandwidth requirements. Make sure that the new bandwidth allocation does not have negative effects on your instance\u2019s network performance.\n\nExtending the example for multiple volumes, the bandwidth looks like this:\n\n\n\n* Total allocation for volumes is 2,000 Mbps,\n* Less boot volume minimum allocation, 393 Mbps,\n* Remaining bandwidth for data volumes: 1,607 Mbps.\n\n\n\nThe volume bandwidth that is available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes. For example, if you have an instance with four identical attached volumes but you are using only one volume, then that volume can get only the bandwidth that is assigned to it. The volume in use can't access extra bandwidth that is assigned to the unused volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n Unattached volume bandwidth versus attached volume bandwidth \n\nWhen you create a stand-alone (unattached) block storage data volume, the volume bandwidth is assigned based on volume capacity, IOPS, and volume profile.

You can also add more metrics by creating custom metrics and adding integrations.\n\n\n\n Metrics and labels \n\nA metric is a quantitative measure that has one or more labels to define its characteristics.\n\nUse metrics to analyze statistically data that has numerical values.\n\nA metric is represented by time series. A time-series is a unique combination of a metric name and label key-value pairs. For example: website_failedRequest |region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'. A data-point is the value generated for a time-series at a given point in time.\n\nLabels are classified as infrastructure labels and metric descriptor labels. Each metric has a set of pre-defined labels. For custom metrics, you can configure more labels.\n\nYou can use labels to identify and differentiate characteristics of a metric, for example,\n\n\n\n* You can group infrastructure objects into logical hierarchies.\n* You can filter out data.\n* You can split aggregated data into segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Collecting default metrics by using the Monitoring agent \n\nWhen you configure a Monitoring agent, data for default metrics is automatically collected.

You do not need additional instrumentation or configuration in your hosts to obtain metrics that are collected automatically by the agent to gain insight into what is happening in them.\n\nTo monitor your infrastructure, network, and applications with the IBM Cloud\u00ae Monitoring service, you can deploy Monitoring agents on supported hosts.

The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

These worker nodes might be in a different worker pool, or if you have stand-alone worker nodes, apps might be scheduled onto stand-alone worker nodes. To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload.\n\nHow can I control how many worker nodes go down at a time during an update or reload?\n: If you need all your worker nodes to be up and running, consider [resizing your worker pool](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_pool_resize) or [adding stand-alone worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_add) to add more worker nodes. You can remove the additional worker nodes after the update is completed.\n\nIn addition, you can create a Kubernetes config map that specifies the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time, such as during an update. Worker nodes are identified by the worker node labels. You can use IBM-provided labels or custom labels that you added to the worker node.\n\nThe Kubernetes config map rules are used for updating worker nodes only.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10284-1470-3569", "score": 13.6581135, "text": "\n* Image and version updates: Worker node updates, such as security patches to the image or Red Hat OpenShift versions, are provided by IBM for you.

For more information, see [Updating clusters, worker nodes, and cluster components](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update).\n* Temporary modifications: If you log in to a pod or use some other process to modify a worker node setting, the modifications are temporary. Worker node lifecycle operations, such as autorecovery, reloading, updating, or replacing a worker node, change any modifications back to the default settings.\n* Persistent modifications: For modifications to persist across worker node lifecycle operations, create a daemon set that uses an init container.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API. The core network services that are offered by NSX are:\n\n\n\n Logical switches \n\nA cloud deployment or a virtual data center might have various applications across multiple tenants.

If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 / 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance. Service availability is defined within the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Service Description](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/pdf/6605-17/$file/i126-6605-17_06-2019_en_US.pdf).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the data center have an impact on performance and reliability of a virtual server? \n\nNo, all of the data centers are of the same quality.

They are endpoints for the overlay network transport zones and VLAN backed transport zones. A gateway cluster can support a single T0 gateway instance.\n* A T0 gateway is a virtual router instance, but not a VM. Multiple T0 gateway instances can run within a gateway cluster each with its own routing table and functions. A gateway cluster must exist before you can create a T0 router instance.\n* A transport zone can span endpoints across different platforms and multiple vSphere vCenter instances. No cross-vCenter linked NSX is required. Transport zones can be excluded from specific endpoints.\n* Uplink failover order is created independent of a particular logical switch as they are created in profiles as \u201cUplink Profiles\u201d and are applied to a particular logical switch based on VLAN. It's possible to need a differing failover order or load balancing of physical uplinks for the same VLAN. Therefore, the uplink profile for a particular VLAN can contain multiple entries for \u201cTeaming\u201d with different a failover order and load balancing. When you assign the uplink profile to a logical switch, the specific teaming profile is chosen.\n* The manager VM and the controller VM function are combined, which results in three NSX-T manager VMs being deployed. If on the same subnet, they use an internal network load balancer. If across different subnets, an external load balancer is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Resource requirements \n\nIn this design, the NSX-T controller Manager VMs are deployed on the management cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-nsx-t-design"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16136-1740-2888", "score": 16.116636, "text": "\nThese servers can have direct layer 2 private network access to bare metal database servers and other more intensive workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n Fully customizable \n\nYou can build-to-suit any virtual server with a number of options.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "score": 22.98099, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

After authentication completes, App ID redirects users back to your application. In order for App ID to be able to redirect users back to your app, you need to register the redirect URI. During the sign-in flow, App ID validates the URIs before it allows clients to participate in the authorization workflow, which helps to prevent phishing attacks and grant code leakage. By registering your URI, you're telling App ID that the URI is trusted and it's OK to redirect your users.\n\n\n\n1. Click Authentication Settings to see your URI and token configuration options.\n2.

For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16334-20193-22029", "score": 18.777273, "text": "\n* \"User is typing\" support: The web chat now supports displaying the \"user is typing\" message for service desks.

The responses from your assistant are defined by you in the underlying skill and can be written in any language you want.\n\nEven if your skill includes responses in a language other than English, some of the phrases that are displayed in the web chat widget are added by the web chat itself and do not come from the underlying skill.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version. If the version you had selected is no longer supported, Watson Assistant retrains using the version labeled as Previous. This means that your assistant will automatically have the supported technologies applied. Assistants that have been modified during the previous 6 months will not be affected. For more information, see [Algorithm version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version).\n\nIn most cases, this retraining will be seamless from an end-user point of view. The same inputs will result in the same actions, intents, and entities being detected. In some cases, the retraining might cause changes in accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-auto-retrain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16233-7-2298", "score": 19.87048, "text": "\nAbout Watson Assistant \n\nUse IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant to build your own branded live chatbot into any device, application, or channel.

The universal language model uses a default algorithm.\n\n\n\n Automatic retraining \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nWatson Assistant was released as a service in July 2016. Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version. If the version you had selected is no longer supported, Watson Assistant retrains using the version labeled as Previous. This means that your assistant will automatically have the supported technologies applied. Assistants that have been modified during the previous 6 months will not be affected.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-algorithm-version"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03363-4-2165", "score": 19.087118, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word barri\u00f3, which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb barrer (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word barrio (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as u\u00f1a vs. una. In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.\n\nNote: Accent normalization is enabled for Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Czech.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03027-8135-10108", "score": 14.392016, "text": "\nThis setting is not reflected in the Try it out panel.\n\n![Bidi options](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/bidi-options.png)\n3.
