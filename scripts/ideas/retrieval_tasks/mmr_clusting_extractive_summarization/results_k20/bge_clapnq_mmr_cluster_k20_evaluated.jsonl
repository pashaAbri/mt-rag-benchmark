Although Chancellor for only just over four years , Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period . Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after G\u00fcnter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live - attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated .

In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur . Based on population genetic models , Galvani and Slatkin ( 2003 ) argue that the intermittent nature of plague epidemics did not generate a sufficiently strong selective force to drive the allele frequency of CCR5 \u039432 to 10 % in Europe .","title":"CCR5","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"810572008_10850-11549-0-699","score":0.679507494,"text":"Columbian Exchange\nThe history of syphilis has been well - studied , but the exact origin of the disease is unknown and remains a subject of debate .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"843458296_1656-2267-0-611","score":0.7133309245,"text":"2018 NBA All-Star Game\nOn October 3 , 2017 , the NBA announced that the format would change from the traditional Eastern Conference versus Western Conference format , and would instead switch to a draft - style format , similar to the format used by the NHL All - Star Game from 2011 through 2015 and the NFL Pro Bowl from 2014 through 2016 .

These four major sports , when played professionally , each occupy a season at different but overlapping , times of the year . College football and basketball attract large audiences . In soccer , the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup , the men 's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women 's team has won the FIFA Women 's World Cup three times ; Major League Soccer is the sport 's highest league in the United States ( featuring 19 American and 3 Canadian teams ) .

The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived , with an initial television contract with the ABC network . The AFL 's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league . Meanwhile , the AFL introduced many new features to Professional Football in the United States : official time on the scoreboard clock , rather than on a watch in the referee 's pocket , as the NFL did ; optional two - point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns ; names on the jerseys of players ; and several others , including expansion of the role of minority players , actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL . The AFL also signed several star college players that had also been drafted by NFL teams . Competition for players heated up in 1965 , when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then - record US $437,000 contract . A five - year , $40 million NBC television contract followed , which helped to sustain the young league . The bidding war for players ended in 1966 , when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger , and the two leagues agreed on one that would take full effect in 1970 . This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year , and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league . That game began play at the end of the 1966 season . Once the merger was completed , it was no longer a championship game between two leagues , and reverted to the NFL championship game , which came to be known as the Super Bowl .","title":"American football","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"856059988_5524-5831-0-307","score":0.6637735963,"text":"American football\nAmerican football evolved from the sports of association football ( soccer ) and rugby football .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League .

They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_212-587-0-375","score":0.7192717195,"text":"Guinea pig\nDomestic guinea pig Two adult guinea pigs Conservation status Domesticated Scientific classification Kingdom : Animalia Phylum : Chordata Class : Mammalia Order : Rodentia Family : Caviidae Genus : Cavia Species : C. porcellus Binomial name Cavia porcellus ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) Synonyms Mus porcellus Cavia cobaya Cavia anolaimae Cavia cutleri Cavia leucopyga Cavia longipilis","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_1589-2154-0-565","score":0.7168293595,"text":"Guinea pig\nIn Western societies , the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet , a type of pocket pet , ever since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century .

With the end of the war in Europe approaching , Roosevelt 's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan ; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties . In return for the Soviet Union 's entrance into the war against Japan , the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island . The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations , and they also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council , which would be charged with ensuring international peace and security . Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland , but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe , which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany . Germany itself would not be dismembered , but would be jointly occupied by the United States , France , Britain , and the Soviet Union . Against Soviet pressure , Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war . Roosevelt 's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial ; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe , while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war .

With the war in Europe occupying the attention of the major colonial powers , Japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the Dutch East Indies , French Indochina , and British Malaya . After Roosevelt announced a $100 million loan to China in reaction to Japan 's occupation of northern French Indochina , Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy .

Overcoming those who favored invading the Soviet Union , the Japanese Army high command successfully advocated for the conquest of Southeast Asia to ensure continued access to raw materials . In July 1941 , after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina , Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan , depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV . Games use the Accelerometer and Gyroscope along with the touchpad found on the Siri Remote for control .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_45056-45809-0-753","score":0.7047411799,"text":"Guinea pig\nAndean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat , and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy .

The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity . The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later , after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century ; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed .","title":"Cell nucleus","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801717519_18188-18952-0-764","score":0.6669386625,"text":"Hormonal contraception\nIn 1921 , Ludwig Haberlandt demonstrated a temporary hormonal contraception in a female rabbit by transplanting ovaries from a second , pregnant , animal .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_191-787-0-560","score":0.7568776011,"text":"Great Wall of China\nGreat Wall of China \u842c\u91cc \u9577\u57ce The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling Map of all the wall constructions General information Type Fortification Country China Coordinates 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Coordinates : 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Technical details Size 21,196 km ( 13,171 mi ) UNESCO World Heritage Site Official name The Great Wall Type Cultural Criteria i , ii , iii , iv , vi Designated 1987 ( 11th session ) Reference no . 438 State Party China Region Asia - Pacific","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_21373-22657-0-1284","score":0.7562121749,"text":"Great Wall of China\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated , in many other locations the Wall is in disrepair .

In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty , the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications . Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling . The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin ; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls , such as those in Gubeikou , often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them . The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass : instead of laying siege , the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates . In 1215 , Genghis Khan besieged , captured , and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing ( modern - day Beijing ) . The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234 .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.2,"recall_3":0.2,"recall_5":0.4,"recall_10":0.6,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.4852285551,"ndcg_cut_10":0.5832678409}}

The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities . A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow . As the disease advances , uncoordinated , jerky body movements become more apparent . Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk . Mental abilities generally decline into dementia . The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people . Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age , but can start at any age . The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation . About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson 's disease .

Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature ( with Macbeth , Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world 's greatest plays ) , and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language . Specifically , in plays like Hamlet , Shakespeare `` integrated characterization with plot , '' such that if the main character was different in any way , the plot would be totally changed . In Romeo and Juliet , Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre ( previous to Shakespeare , romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy ) . Through his soliloquies , Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character 's inner motivations and conflict ( up until Shakespeare , soliloquies were often used by playwrights to `` introduce ( characters ) , convey information , provide an exposition or reveal plans '' ) .","title":"Shakespeare's influence","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.3333333333,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.1815417925,"ndcg_cut_10":0.329582748}}

Although Richard III was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 20 October 1597 by the bookseller Andrew Wise , who published the first Quarto ( Q1 ) later that year ( with printing done by Valentine Simmes ) , Christopher Marlowe 's Edward II , which can not have been written much later than 1592 ( Marlowe died in 1593 ) is thought to have been influenced by it .

Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' .

Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state , whereas the League , fearing domination by the Hindu majority , desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim - majority regions .

Patel 's organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India . Patel was arrested on 9 August and was imprisoned with the entire Congress Working Committee from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar . Here he spun cloth , played bridge , read a large number of books , took long walks , and practised gardening . He also provided emotional support to his colleagues while awaiting news and developments from the outside . Patel was deeply pained at the news of the deaths of Mahadev Desai and Kasturba Gandhi later that year . But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing `` fullest peace '' for having done `` their duty '' . Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British had employed ruthless means of suppression , the Quit India movement was `` by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857 '' , as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill . More than 100,000 people were arrested and many were killed in violent struggles with the police . Strikes , protests , and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India . When Patel was released on 15 June 1945 , he realised that the British were preparing proposals to transfer power to India .","title":"Vallabhbhai Patel","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"849690897_12934-14211-0-1277","score":0.69508636,"text":"Vallabhbhai Patel\nWhen Gandhi was in prison , Patel was asked by Members of Congress to lead the satyagraha in Nagpur in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag . He organised thousands of volunteers from all over the country to take part in processions of people violating the law . Patel negotiated a settlement obtaining the release of all prisoners and allowing nationalists to hoist the flag in public . Later that year , Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting that the police were in league with local dacoits ( Devar Baba ) in the Borsad taluka even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area . More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak in support of proposed agitation against the tax , which was deemed immoral and unnecessary . He organised hundreds of Congressmen , sent instructions , and received information from across the district . Every village in the taluka resisted payment of the tax and prevented the seizure of property and land . After a protracted struggle , the government withdrew the tax . Historians believe that one of Patel 's key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities , which had been divided along socio - economic lines .","title":"Vallabhbhai Patel","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.1845756968}}

According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto - Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to a theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800 -- 450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . Thus this area is sometimes called the `` Celtic homeland '' . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .","title":"Celts","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"852484941_37195-38401-0-1206","score":0.6934341788,"text":"Celts\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries , scholars commonly dated the `` arrival '' of Celtic culture in Britain ( via an invasion model ) to the 6th century BC , corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England . Some Iron Age migration does seem to have occurred but the nature of the interactions with the indigenous populations of the isles is unknown . In the late Iron Age . According to this model , by about the 6th century ( Sub-Roman Britain ) , most of the inhabitants of the Isles were speaking Celtic languages of either the Goidelic or the Brythonic branch . Since the late 20th century , a new model has emerged ( championed by archaeologists such as Barry Cunliffe and Celtic historians such as John T. Koch ) which places the emergence of Celtic culture in Britain much earlier , in the Bronze Age , and credits its spread not to invasion , but due to a gradual emergence in situ out of Proto - Indo - European culture ( perhaps introduced to the region by the Bell Beaker People , and enabled by an extensive network of contacts that existed between the peoples of Britain and Ireland and those of the Atlantic seaboard .","title":"Celts","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"852484941_22507-23272-0-763","score":0.6906699538,"text":"Celts\nIn various academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon , through the cultures of Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne .

If the first child is a girl , and they are able to have a second child , then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy . If a couple already has two or more boys , the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction . This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring , a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play . Zeng 1993 reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys . A study by Anderson & Silver ( 1995 ) found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province : a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys . This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister , who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males , it was also much more likely to engage in `` stopping behavior '' , i.e. , to stop having more children .","title":"One-child policy","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"849505680_11708-12089-0-381","score":0.6272179484,"text":"Stepfamily\nIn Canada , one needs to put into writing what the child 's circumstances are for being adopted .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced .

The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance .

'' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season .

It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased . The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War . Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws , and offer far higher productivity than their hand - powered forebears .","title":"Cotton gin","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"805474955_1559-2098-0-539","score":0.7889428735,"text":"Cotton gin\nEli Whitney invented his cotton gin in 1793 .

In 1840 Fones McCarthy received a patent for a `` Smooth Cylinder Cotton - gin '' , a roller gin . McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate . In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 .

Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased .

These early gins were difficult to use and required a great deal of skill . A narrow single roller was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate . In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade .
