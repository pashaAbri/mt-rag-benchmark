Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League .

From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_9951-10190-0-239", "score": 18.21587, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2016 MLS All - Star Game July 28 , 2016 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 2 Arsenal ( show ) Avaya Stadium , San Jose , California Drogba 45 + 2 ' Report Campbell 10 ' ( pen . ) Akpom 87 ' Attendance : 18,000 Referee : Chris Penso MVP : Chuba Akpom MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_9675-9928-0-251", "score": 18.170954, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2015 MLS All - Star Game July 29 , 2015 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 1 Tottenham Hotspur ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado Kak\u00e1 20 ' ( pen . ) Villa 23 ' Report Kane 37 ' Attendance : 18,671 Referee : Ismail Elfath MVP : Kak\u00e1 MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_8544-8798-0-254", "score": 18.163227, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2011 MLS All - Star Game July 27 , 2011 MLS All - Stars 0 -- 4 Manchester United ( show ) Red Bull Arena , Harrison , New Jersey Report Anderson 20 ' Park 45 ' Berbatov 52 ' Welbeck 68 ' Attendance : 26,760 Referee : Jair Marrufo MVP : Park Ji - sung MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_7327-7564-0-235", "score": 18.005198, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2007 MLS All - Star Game July 19 , 2007 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 0 Celtic ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado \u00c1ngel 36 ' Toja 44 ' Report Attendance : 18,661 Referee : Baldomero Toledo MVP : Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_9103-9364-0-261", "score": 17.996836, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2013 MLS All - Star Game July 31 , 2013 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 3 Roma ( show ) Sporting Park , Kansas City , Kansas 20 : 30 Gonzalez 90 + 1 ' Report Strootman 4 ' Florenzi 47 ' Tallo 68 ' Attendance : 21,175 Referee : Hilario Grajeda MVP : Alessandro Florenzi MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832021719_10217-10511-0-291", "score": 17.874767, "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2017 MLS All - Star Game August 2 , 2017 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 1 ( 2 -- 4 p ) Real Madrid ( show ) Soldier Field , Chicago Dwyer 87 ' Report Mayoral 59 ' Attendance : 61,428 Referee : Allen Chapman MVP : Borja Mayoral Penalties Dwyer Dos Santos Valeri Almir\u00f3n Benzema Bale Kova\u010di\u0107 Marcelo MLS", "title": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_38877-39736-0-859", "score": 17.213877, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases .

This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_3168-3898-0-728", "score": 29.037973, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus , with porcellus being Latin for `` little pig '' .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_588-1089-0-501", "score": 25.779905, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also known as cavy or domestic cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia .

This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 , which provided for comprehensive planning , technical services , research , and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure . The Act was amended in 1965 , establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so . Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s , in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns . In 1970 EPA was created by the Richard Nixon administration , and authority for managing various environmental programs was transferred to the new agency . In 1972 , Congress passed the Clean Water Act , requiring industrial plants and municipal sewage plants to proactively improve their waste treatment practices in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources . In 1974 , the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems . This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed . From then on , drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal , state , and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations . The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion in research and construction grants for municipal sewage treatment . The funds initially provided an incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure for municipalities , instead of decentralized systems . However , the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems , and financial assistance was made available for such alternatives . In the mid-1990s decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population , and approximately 37 percent of new housing developments .", "title": "Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "810308089_35459-36467-0-1008", "score": 17.468239, "text": "Great Lakes\nHowever , those treatment system upgrades have not , contrary to federal laws in both countries , yet eliminated Combined sewer Overflow events .

The need for irrigation led the Sumerians , and later the Akkadians , to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers . Major cities , such as Ur and Uruk , took root on tributaries of the Euphrates , while others , notably Lagash , were built on branches of the Tigris . The rivers provided the further benefits of fish ( used both for food and fertilizer ) , reeds , and clay ( for building materials ) . With irrigation , the food supply in Mesopotamia was compabale to the Canadian prairies . The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the Fertile Crescent , which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile . Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops , portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable . This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia . Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts . Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley , onions , grapes , turnips , and apples . Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine . As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian , farmers did not depend on slaves to complete farm work for them , but there were some exceptions . There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical ( i.e. the escape / mutiny of the slave ) . Although the rivers sustained life , they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities . The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers ; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept . Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils , leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad , further north .", "title": "Mesopotamia", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "800226279_21344-21866-0-522", "score": 16.313309, "text": "Mesopotamia\nMesopotamian people invented many technologies including metal and copper - working , glass and lamp making , textile weaving , flood control , water storage , and irrigation .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_588-1089-0-501", "score": 22.648693, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also known as cavy or domestic cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia .

Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color .

Civil war engulfed the Roman state in the mid 1st century BC , first between Julius Caesar and Pompey , and finally between Octavian and Mark Antony . Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian imperator ( `` commander '' ) thus beginning the Principate , the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD ; they later awarded him the name Augustus , `` the venerated '' . The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs : the Julio - Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors -- Tiberius , Caligula , Claudius , and Nero -- before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife - torn Year of Four Emperors , from which Vespasian emerged as victor . Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty , to be followed by the Nerva -- Antonine dynasty which produced the `` Five Good Emperors '' : Nerva , Trajan , Hadrian , Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius . In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius , a contemporary observer , the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron '' -- a famous comment which has led some historians , notably Edward Gibbon , to take Commodus ' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire .", "title": "History of the Roman Empire", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "856995355_9676-10967-0-1291", "score": 19.76651, "text": "Middle Ages\nThe Emperor Diocletian ( r . 284 -- 305 ) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286 ; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers , as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other .

The poem tells of a king , now identified as King Xuan ( r . 827 -- 782 BC ) of the Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046 -- 771 BC ) , who commanded General Nan Zhong ( \u5357\u4ef2 ) to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the Xianyun . The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 -- 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( \u6210 \u5468 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 -- 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1,400 metres ( 4,600 feet ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in Hancheng , Shaanxi .

By 38 AD , as a result of raids by the Xiongnu further to the west against the Wei River valley , orders were given for a series of walls to be constructed as defences for the Fen River , the southward course of the Yellow River , and the region of the former imperial capital , Chang'an . These constructions were defensive in nature , which marked a shift from the offensive walls of the preceding Emperor Wu and the rulers of the Warring States .

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders .

The Qin reformist Shang Yang forced the Wei out of their walled area west of the Yellow River in 340 BC , and King Huiwen of Qin ( r . 338 -- 311 BC ) took 25 Yiqu forts in a northern offensive . When King Huiwen died , his widow the Queen Dowager Xuan acted as regent because the succeeding sons were deemed too young to govern . During the reign of King Zhaoxiang ( r . 306 -- 251 BC ) , the queen dowager apparently entered illicit relations with the Yiqu king and gave birth to two of his sons , but later tricked and killed the Yiqu king . Following that coup , the Qin army marched into Yiqu territory at the queen dowager 's orders ; the Qin annihilated the Yiqu remnants and thus came to possess the Ordos region . At this point the Qin built a wall around their new territories to defend against the true nomads even further north , incorporating the Wei walls .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 .

In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit .

In an agreement brokered by Schramm and AFL founder Lamar Hunt , the two leagues announced their merger deal on June 8 , 1966 . The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end - of - season World Championship Game between the two league champions ( later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game ) . Still another city received an NFL franchise thanks to the AFL , as New Orleans was awarded an NFL team after Louisiana 's federal Congressmen pushed for the passage of Public Law 89 - 800 , which permitted the merger and exempted the action from Anti-Trust restrictions . The monopoly that would be created needed to be legitimized by an act of Congress . In 1970 , the leagues fully merged under the name National Football League and divided into two conferences of an equal number of teams . Since the pre-merger NFL had six more teams than the AFL , three NFL teams -- the Pittsburgh Steelers , Cleveland Browns , and Baltimore Colts -- moved to the AFC , the conference containing the AFL teams . Two other teams , the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers , were also added to the NFL as part of the merger agreement . ( These two teams were not added until 1976 ; during the early 1970s , there were some concerns that several of the newly transplanted teams did not have stadiums big or modern enough to accommodate the NFL , and Seattle and Tampa Bay unsuccessfully attempted to court teams such as the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots to their cities . Once the Bills and Patriots built new stadiums and solidified their place in their home markets , the NFL awarded Seattle and Tampa Bay expansion franchises of their own . ) There was also a financial settlement , with the AFL teams paying a combined $18 million over 20 years .", "title": "History of the National Football League", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "832860310_30201-30760-0-559", "score": 16.707277, "text": "NFL playoffs\nIn October 2013 , NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced plans to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams , with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason .

Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

The religious stirrings of the slogan and the political outrage over the partition were combined as young men , in groups such as Jugantar , took to bombing public buildings , staging armed robberies , and assassinating British officials .

One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal , built to link the Midwest to the Port of New York , a significant seaport during that time . The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West , allowing settlers to travel west , send goods to markets in frontier cities , and export goods via the Hudson River and New York City . The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation , surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts . After the completion of the Erie Canal , smaller canals were built to connect it with the new system . The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain . This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway , and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City . Another major canal was the Oswego Canal , which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario , and could be used to bypass Niagara Falls . The Cayuga - Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake . Farther south , the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale , Pennsylvania , and the Hudson River at Kingston , New York .

No one had a bad word to say about Jennifer Aniston '' , with whose performance audiences instantly fell in love . Aniston 's performance has been consistently praised since her debut in the pilot , about which Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker wrote that the actress portrays Rachel with `` prickly intelligence '' . Writing for The Baltimore Sun , David Zurawik cited Aniston among the show 's `` very strong cast '' , while Variety 's Tony Scott agreed that `` All six of the principals ... appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills '' ; Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised the work of show 's female cast equally . TV Guide wrote that Aniston `` instantly charmed audiences with her perfect looks and endearingly flawed persona '' , while Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast referred to Aniston 's tenure on Friends as not `` a leading lady performance '' but instead `` the work of a brilliant character actress . '' The Guardian 's Ryan Gilbey highlighted Aniston as the cast member `` least reliant on goofball caricature '' , observing that `` Playing the only character with whom a sane viewer might reasonably identify also meant that she got the lion 's share of attention '' . Writing that the actress `` quickly stole our hearts as the daddy 's girl and aspiring fashionista , '' Andrew Collins of Radio Times hailed Aniston as a `` natural comic performer , as adept with a subtle nose wrinkle as a full - on pratfall , and fluent in quick - fire patter '' .

According to The Inquisitr News , Rachel is `` the role that would end up launching ( Aniston 's ) success '' , while Bradford Evans of Splitsider believes `` that Jennifer Aniston likely would n't have become a major movie star without Friends '' . While ranking Aniston the most attractive sitcom star of the 1990s , Josh Robertson of Complex magazine wrote that `` With the haircut , the TV fame , and a true gift for comedy ... combined , Aniston became a big star '' , replacing Cox as the show 's `` established hottie '' .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show .

These units were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914 , but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915 . Aerial photography was attempted during 1914 , but again , it only became effective the following year . In August 1915 , General Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson . The British use of air power evolved during the war , from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of the air above the trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind the line .
