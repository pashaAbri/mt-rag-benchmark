The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation.

(Simon is a developer on the Watson Assistant team.)\n* Dealing with ambiguous intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish that is ambiguous enough that your assistant finds two or more nodes with intents that could potentially address it. How does the dialog know which dialog branch to follow? If you enable disambiguation, it can show users their options and ask the user to pick the correct one. See [Disambiguation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity. But, using @appliance:(air conditioner) gets expanded to entity['appliance'].contains('air conditioner'), which matches whenever there is at least one @appliance entity of value 'air conditioner' detected in the user input.\n* Hiding data from the log: You can prevent information from being stored in Watson logs by storing it in a context variable and nesting the context variable within the $private section of the message context. For example: $private.my_info. Storing data in the private object hides it from the logs only. The information is still stored in the underlying JSON object.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice.

This policy is enforced until a specified date or the removal of any legal holds.\n\n\n\n Why use Object Lock? \n\nObject Lock helps customers govern data preservation and retention requirements by enforcing data immutability for their backup, disaster recovery, and cyber resiliency workloads.\n\nObject Lock ensures that data cannot be deleted by anyone and there is no way to suspend retention on an object. Read the documentation carefully before locking objects with a retention period.\n\nWhen using Object Lock, it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with any regulations that you (your organization) may be subject to when it comes to preservation and storage of data for long term retention.\n\nWhen using Object Lock, you are responsible for ensuring that your IBM Cloud Account is kept in good standing per IBM Cloud policies and guidelines for as long as the data is subject to a retention period. Refer to IBM Cloud Service terms for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nThere are two ways use Object Lock to protect data: retention periods and legal holds.\n\n\n\n* A retention period defines a time frame during which an object is unable to be modified or deleted.\n* A legal hold also prevents an object from being altered, but only remains in place until it is explicitly lifted.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to make use of any combination of these parameters - an object version can have one, both, or neither.\n\n\n\n Retain Until Date (Retention Period) \n\nIf you need to protect an object version for a fixed amount of time, you need to specify a Retain Until Date which determines the period in which it cannot be altered. The object version can be be deleted after this date is passed (assuming there are no legal holds on the object version).\n\nThe retention period for new objects can be inherited from the default value set on the bucket, or it can be explicitly defined when writing the object by specifying a Retain Until Date.\n\nWhen you use bucket default settings, you don\u2019t specify a Retain Until Date. Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05007-1652-3696","score":0.7361233234,"text":"\nYou will not be billed for any associated storage for objects once they are deleted.\n* In [versioning enabled or suspended buckets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning), a regular rule retains the current version and creates a delete marker rather than permanently deleting data.\n* The expiration time of non-current versions is determined by its successor's last modified time, rounded to the next day at midnight UTC.\n* If versions are manually deleted from an object that has versions expected to be expired the next day, those expirations may not occur.\n\n\n\nPolicies specifying a date in the past may take up to a few days to complete.\n\nWithout caution, data might be permanently lost with when using [expiration rules on a versioned bucket](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning).

Once set to indefinite, user applications can then can change the object retention to a finite value later. For example, a company has a policy of retaining employee records for three years after the employee leaves the company. When an employee joins the company, the records that are associated with that employee can be indefinitely retained. When the employee leaves the company, the indefinite retention is converted to a finite value of three years from the current time, as defined by company policy.

The maximum execution time for the Estimator primitive is 18000 seconds (5 hours).\n* Programs: The maximum execution time for a program is set on the job's options by using the max_execution_time parameter. If specified, it must be at least 300 seconds.\n* Systems: The system limit on the job execution time is 3 hours for a job that is running on a simulator and 8 hours for a job running on a physical system.\n* Sessions: When a session is started, it is assigned a maximum session timeout value, which is the system limit by default. After the maximum session timeout is reached, the session is permanently closed and any queued jobs that remain in the session are put into a failed state. The maximum session timeout value is set on the max_time parameter, which can be greater than the program\u2019s max_execution_time.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 5 minute interactive timeout value. If there are no session jobs queued within that window, the session is temporarily deactivated and normal job selection resumes. After the new session becomes inactive, if the job scheduler gets a job from the original session and its maximum timeout value has not been reached, the session is reactivated until its maximum timeout value is reached.\n\nThe timer for max_time is not paused during any temporary deactivation periods due to interactive timeouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How to limit your cost \n\nThe time your job takes (and therefore, its cost) depends on how many iterations you make in a session and how many shots are run in each iteration. Thus, you can manage your cost by running only as many iterations and shots as you need.\n\nAdditionally, an instance administrator can limit how much is spent.

The service's processing time cannot cause the session to exceed the 30-second session timeout.\n\nFor example, if you send one hour of audio in the first 10 seconds of a session, the service might take 300 seconds to process the audio.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\nAll Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by Hyper Protect Crypto Services.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05166-7-1684","score":0.7303215265,"text":"\nRelease notes for Object Storage \n\nNews on the latest releases from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage provide the updates you need on all things related to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n 14 June 2023 \n\nNew location!\n: Buckets can now be created in a Regional (MZR) configuration in Madrid, Spain.

However, because the user's input includes the word tomorrow and the reservation node with slots is being processed, your assistant assumes the user is providing or updating the reservation date instead. The current node always gets priority. If you define a clear confirmation statement, such as, Ok, setting the reservation date to tomorrow, the user is more likely to realize there was a miscommunication and correct it.\n\nConversely, while filling slots, if the user provides a value that is not expected by any of the slots, there is a chance it will match against a completely unrelated root node that the user never intended to digress to.\n\nBe sure to do lots of testing as you configure the digression behavior.\n* When to use digressions instead of slot handlers: For general questions that users might ask at any time, use a root node that allows digressions into it, processes the input, and then goes back to the flow that was in progress. For nodes with slots, try to anticipate the types of related questions users might want to ask while filling in the slots, and address them by adding handlers to the node.\n\nFor example, if the node with slots collects the information required to fill out an insurance claim, then you might want to add handlers that address common questions about insurance. However, for questions about how to get help, or your stores locations, or the history of your company, use a root level node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disambiguation \n\nWhen you enable disambiguation, you instruct your assistant to ask users for help when it finds that more than one dialog node can respond to their input.

Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.\n\nYou can check your usage by going to Manage > Billing and usage in the IBM Cloud console, and selecting Usage.

You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1\/icons\/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

The per-minute price of all audio that you recognize in a month is reduced once you reach the threshold of one million minutes of audio for that month. The price does not depend on how long the service takes to process the audio. (Per-minute pricing is different for the Standard plan.)\n\nFor information about pricing for the Plus and Standard plans, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog\/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Do you round up to the nearest minute for every call to the API? \n\nIBM does not round up the length of the audio for every API call that the service receives. Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11142-1400-2265","score":0.6597238183,"text":"\nGo to the [catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog).\n2.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1\/icons\/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00623-7-1781","score":0.8168488145,"text":"\nWorking with IBM Cloudant Query \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query is a declarative JSON querying syntax for IBM Cloudant databases.

Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to \/$DATABASE\/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Container Registry benefits\n\n Benefit Description \n\n Highly available and scalable private registry.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07949-12261-14447","score":0.8231058717,"text":"\nCombined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Container Registry \n\nUse [Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview) to store and access private container images.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01390-0-434","score":0.8190966845,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Managing security and compliance for Container Registry \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry is integrated with the Security and Compliance Center to help you manage security and compliance for your organization.\n\nFor more information about managing security and compliance, see [Getting started with Security and Compliance Center](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-manage-security-compliance"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16729-71418-73421","score":0.8107268214,"text":"\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry provides a multi-tenant private image registry that you can use to store and share your container images with users in your IBM Cloud account.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-06-02\n\n\n\n[Encrypting images for content confidentiality](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_encrypt)Encrypting images for content confidentiality\n\nYou can protect the confidentiality of your IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry images, and ensure that hosts that aren't trusted can't run the images.\n\nKey Protect Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-01-25\n\n\n\n[Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-iam_access)Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out how to grant access to your resources by configuring IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM) for IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.\n\nContainer Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-01-31\n\n\n\n[Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_tutorial_workflow)Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out about the basic functions of both IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-06-19\n\n\n\n[Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-catalog-opbundle-tutorial)Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry\n\nThis tutorial walks you through how to onboard a sample Operator bundle from a Red Hat\u00ae registry to your account.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

In addition, the automation deploys an extra virtual server instance (shown as the Login Node in the architecture diagram) so you can easily build and assemble applications for your cluster right away.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift for HPC enables three interfaces: UI, API, and CLI. The UI involves use of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Cloud\/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation. Any updates that are needed post-deployment regarding Red Hat OpenShift configuration or setup should be performed by using Red Hat OpenShift tools and commands. If you use the Schematics interface to make changes to configuration properties and reapply those changes, you can cause disruptions to the running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Restoring it back to a working state might not be easy.\n\n\n\n  Architecture diagram \n\nZoom\n\n![Architecture diagram](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9de14ae11cc0bda57c240e5b42f2964edeaab3c6\/hpc-openshift\/images\/hpccluster_openshift_architecture.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

You can use Hyper-V to customize the system resources for each virtual machine, including memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n How much RAM does a virtual machine need? \n\nRAM needs vary based on requirements for the virtual machine. Check the system requirements for your guest operating system. The amount of memory that is provided to a virtual machine can be changed at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can a virtual machine access to more than one processor? \n\nYou can grant a virtual machine access to multiple processors with any Windows virtual machine. However, Linux virtual machines are limited to a single processor.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can hard disk sizes change after a virtual machine is created? \n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does each virtual operating system need to have a license? \n\nWindows virtual machines are licensed through IBM Cloud. Linux virtual machines are freely licensed and require no action.\n\n\n\n\n\n Will the virtual machines have access to the private network? \n\nYes. Virtual machines can connect to both a public and private network.\n\n\n\n\n\n What advantages are there to providing private network access to virtual machines? \n\nProviding private network access to virtual machines allows virtual machines to communicate with each other. Private network access also allows virtual machines to communicate with other internal systems such as NAS and iSCSI and any other servers that you have with IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can virtual machines use the secondary IP block that came with the server? \n\nNo. The secondary IP that was provided with your server is routed specifically to work on the physical server and not a virtual machine. You need portable IP blocks to connect your virtual machine to the network.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtualization?topic=virtualization-faqs-hyper-v"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14275-1608-3527","score":0.7032654881,"text":"\nThe following user interfaces are available for VMware vCenter.\n\n\n\n* Web Client\n* Thick Client\n* VMware API\n* VMware CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n VMware vCenter features \n\nVMware vCenter offers the folliwing features.\n\n\n\n* Centralized control and visibility for all aspects within managed vSphere hosts and guest virtual machines.\n* Provides a window interface view through the vCenter web client for compute network and storage management.\n* Proactive Optimization.

In the simplest case, the text you specify here can more explicitly state the type of information you need the user to provide. If you use this action with a conditional response, be sure to word the conditional response such that you clearly state what was wrong with the user's answer and what you expect them to provide instead.\n* Prompt again: After displaying the Not found response, your assistant repeats the slot prompt again and waits for the user to respond. If you use this action with a conditional response, the response can merely explain what was wrong about the answer the user provided. It does not need to reiterate the type of information you want the user to provide because the slot prompt typically explains that.\n\nIf you choose this option, consider adding at least one variation of the Not found response so that the user does not see the exact same text more than once. Take the opportunity to use different wording to explain to the user what information you need them to provide and in what format.\n* Skip this slot: Instructs your assistant to stop trying to fill the current slot, and instead, move on to the prompt for the next empty slot. This option is useful in a slot where you want to both make the slot optional and to display a prompt that asks the user for information. For example, you might have a @seating entity that captures restaurant seating preferences, such as outside, near the fireplace, private, and so on. You can add a slot that prompts the user with, Do you have any seating preferences? and checks for @seating.values. If a valid response is provided, it saves the preference information to $seating_preferences. However, by choosing this action as the Not found response next step, you instruct your assistant to stop trying to fill this slot if the user does not provide a valid value for it.\n* Skip to response: If, when the condition you define is met, you no longer need to fill any of the remaining slots in this node, choose this action to skip the remaining slots and go directly to the node-level response next. For example, if after capturing the one-way flight information, the slot prompt is, Are you buying round trip tickets?","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slots"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14025-7-2157","score":0.6410061121,"text":"\nManaging provisioning scripts \n\nYou can use provisioning scripts to specify a URL to a script that runs on a newly provisioned device.

This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution.

This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications.

However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills.

This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04665-7-1913","score":0.7301459312,"text":"\nHow Cloud Foundry works with IBM Cloud \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloud Foundry is deprecated and no longer supported as of 1 June 2023.

The strongSwan VPN pod and the routes daemon set can be deployed into kube-system or any other namespace. If the strongSwan VPN is not deployed into the specified namespace, then the vpn-strongswan-ping-remote-ip-1 Helm test fails. This failure is expected and acceptable. The test pings the remote.privateIPtoPing private IP address of the on-premises VPN gateway from a pod which is not in the namespace that has direct access to the remote subnet. However, the VPN pod is still able to forward traffic to pods in the namespaces that do have routes to the remote subnet, and traffic can still flow correctly.

When a pod is configured with host networking, the app running in the pod can listen on the network interfaces of the worker node that it is on. These host networking pods can exist in any namespace.

You can choose to customize the information that is injected in to the tokens by the service. By injecting the information into your tokens, it's available to your application at run time without you having to configure extra network calls. For more information about tokens and how they're used in App ID, see [Understanding tokens](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-tokens).\n\nBy customizing your token configuration, you can ensure that your security and user experience needs are met. However, should a token ever become compromised, a malicious user might have more information or time that can be used to affect your application. Be sure that you understand the security implications of the customizations that you want to make before you make them.\n\n\n\n Understanding custom claims mapping \n\nA claim is a statement that an entity makes about itself or on behalf of someone else. For example, if you signed into an application by using an identity provider, the provider would send the application a group of claims or statements about you to the app so that it can group with information that it already knows about you. This way, when you sign in, the app is set up with your information, in the way that you configured it.\n\n\n\n What types of claims can I define? \n\nThe claims that are provided by App ID fall into several categories that are differentiated by their level of customization.\n\nNormalized claims\n: In each identity token, there is a set of claims that is recognized by App ID as normalized. When available, the claims are mapped directly from your identity provider to the token by default. The claims can't be explicitly omitted but they can be overwritten in your token by custom claims. The claims include name, email, picture, and locale.\n\nRestricted claims\n: Restricted claims are those that have limited customization possibilities and cannot be overwritten by custom mappings. For an access token, scope is the only restricted claim. Although it cannot be overwritten, it can be extended with your own scope.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/appid?topic=appid-customizing-tokens"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02765-2827-4667","score":0.6836431026,"text":"\nAfter a successful authentication, App ID creates a session cookie with encrypted access and identity tokens that your apps can use for authentication.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. For more information, see [Configuring backup call center support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-transfer-service).\n* Call failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent.\n\n\n\nIf, after you transfer the call to a human, the connection to a live agent fails for any reason, you can configure what to do.\n\n\n\n* Transfer failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller if transfer to a live agent fails. The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03312-7276-9469","score":0.637899518,"text":"\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI\/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team.

In this case, you can choose to continue without selecting a role so that the new credential is created without an IAM Service role. This way, you can manage the fine-grained access by creating an IAM policy that you scope to a specific resource, like a bucket.

Compared to the classic bare metal infrastructures, Bare Metal Servers for VPC provides better connectivity and networking throughput by using VPC concepts.\n\nBare Metal Servers for VPC has local NVMe, which you can use to create VMWare vSAN. For more information about file storage, see [About File Storage for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-about).\n\n\n\n Bare metal servers versus virtual server instances \n\nIn general, you choose bare metal servers over virtual server instances if you need access to the actual hardware to run a hypervisor such as VMware's ESXi, or run real-time workloads.\n\nBare Metal Servers for VPC sets up a VMware virtualization environment in a VPC. Bare Metal Servers for VPC offers improved security compared to a virtual server instance as customers fully manage the physical resources of a bare metal server until it is decommissioned. By contrast, virtual server instances can share resources such as CPU, memory, and processes, across an IBM managed hypervisor.\n\nKeep the following lifecycle operations differences in mind:\n\n\n\n* For bare metal servers, you can restart, or power the server off and on. When you power off a server, the server is powered off physically, but the data on it is preserved, and you continue to be billed.\n* For virtual server instances, you can restart, stop, and start the instance. But these functions don't impact the physical server status. Billing is suspended for some types of instances when powered off. However, any persistent storage continues to be billed. For more information about suspend billing, see [Suspend billing for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-suspend-billing).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\nSee to the following topics to start planning and creating your bare metal servers on VPC:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-bare-metal-servers"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10864-3733-5982","score":0.6678510308,"text":"\nA need is created for an elastic system where normal workload might be small, but needs to scale quickly with predictable response time. So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures. However, usually the combination of different services and data bridges requires high performance and flexible pipelines. Spanning from IoT devices up to cloud storage, and an analytics platform. Often pre-configured bridges lack the programmability to implement and fine-tune a particular solution architecture. Given the variety of pipelines, and the lack of standardization around data fusion in general (IoT in particular), it is common to see environments where the pipeline requires custom data transformation. These custom data transformations apply to format conversion, filtering, or augmentation. Cloud Functions is an excellent tool to implement such a transformation, in a serverless manner, where the custom logic is hosted on a fully managed and elastic cloud platform.\n\nLook at the following sample IoT application that uses Cloud Functions, Node-RED, Cognitive, and other services: [Serverless transformation of IoT data-in-motion with Cloud Functions](https:\/\/medium.com\/openwhisk\/serverless-transformation-of-iot-data-in-motion-with-openwhisk-272e36117d6c).\n\n\n\n\n\n API backend \n\nServerless computing platforms give developers a rapid way to build APIs without servers.

For the no OS option to work properly, PXE setup needs to be in the same VLAN as the Bare Metal Servers, or DHCP forwarding needs to be used.\n\nIt might be necessary to open a support case to request that the switch ports be regrouped in basic mode for this option to work.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00029-8568-9861","score":0.7275200486,"text":"\n\"spark.hive.metastore.client.auth.mode\":\"PLAIN\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.use.SSL\":\"true\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.stats.autogather\":\"false\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.client.plain.username\":\"<CHANGEME-CRN-DATA-ENGINE-INSTANCE>\",\n for spark 3.3\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"\/opt\/ibm\/jdk\/lib\/security\/cacerts\",\n for spark 3.1, spark 3.2\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"file:\/\/\/opt\/ibm\/jdk\/jre\/lib\/security\/cacerts\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars\":\"\/opt\/ibm\/connectors\/data-engine\/hms-client\/\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.version\":\"3.0\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\":\"file:\/\/\/tmp\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hadoop.metastore.catalog.default\":\"spark\"\n},\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"application\": \"cos:\/\/mybucket.ALIAS NAME\/select_query_data_engine.py\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n}\nShow more\n\nParameter values:\n\n\n\n* ALIAS NAME: specify the data engine endpoint for your region.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.7063522935,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.6511025429,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04170-7-2189","score":0.6611407399,"text":"\nJavaScript detections \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services (CIS) bot features include JavaScript detections.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.6606591344,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07982-7-2122","score":0.6821168661,"text":"\nHandling and securing secrets \n\nA secret is any piece of data that is sensitive within the context of an application or service.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03329-3417-4930","score":0.7184298635,"text":"\nYou successfully started to build your training data by adding prebuilt content from IBM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Build a dialog \n\nA [dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12170-1498-3591","score":0.7203510404,"text":"\nVPC VPC provides you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud. \n zones You must have one VPC subnet for each zone in your cluster.

In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and IBM Cloud service on the private backbone.

The VPC provisioned includes virtual server instances with high network performance. The VPC infrastructure contains a number of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, including Virtual Servers. After the VPC is provisioned, the scripts use the Ansible Playbook to install the SAP system. IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware that uses Intel Xeon CPUs and additional Intel technologies.\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud VPC introduction \n\nA VPC is a public cloud offering that an enterprise uses to establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared [public cloud](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/public) infrastructure. VPCs give an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\n\nImagine that a cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure is a residential apartment building and multiple families live inside. Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium; no one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission. A VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic\/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to manually provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance. VPC infrastructure contains a number of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, including Virtual Servers for VPC. Use the following information to understand a simple use case for planning, creating, and configuring resources for your VPC, and learn about more VPC overviews and VPC tutorials.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sap?topic=sap-sap-automate-intro-hana-db-backup-cos"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16729-187656-189537","score":0.7934898734,"text":"\nA Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides network isolation and security in the IBM Cloud.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into.

Cloud Functions serverless architecture reduces the constraint on the granularity of your microservices architecture.\n\nWhen not in use, Cloud Functions costs nothing. Your code runs only when a specific action occurs, such as an HTTP call, database state change, or other type of event that triggers the execution of your code. You get billed by millisecond of execution time rounded up to the nearest 100 MS, not per hour of VM utilization regardless of whether that VM was doing useful work. Because you pay only when events are consumed and not based on the number of environments, you can break down your app into 100, 1000, or even more microservices.\n\n\n\n\n\n Run actions in any region \n\nIn traditional architectures, code must be running in each region to be executed there and the infrastructure for that region must also be paid for.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture.

IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS Edition is being replaced by IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric!! IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS Edition will no longer be supported after July 31, 2023. Customers have been directed to migrate their networks by July 31, 2023. After this date, IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS networks that are not migrated to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric will be at risk for potential security vulnerabilities. A migration tool is provided from your console, and the disruption to your network is minimal. See [Migrating to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-migrating-to-hlf-support) for details.\n\nThis guide helps you understand the pricing model for IBM\u00ae Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud, and how much you will pay when you develop and grow your blockchain network of peers, ordering nodes, and Certificate Authorities components, which are based on Hyperledger Fabric v2.2.10.\n\n\n\n Pricing model \n\nIBM Blockchain Platform introduces a new hourly pricing model that is based on virtual processor core (VPC) allocation. This simplified model is based on the amount of CPU (or VPC) that your IBM Blockchain Platform nodes are allocated on an hourly basis, at a flat rate of $0.29 USD\/VPC-hour.\n\nA VPC is a unit of measurement that is used to determine the licensing cost of IBM products. It is based on the number of virtual cores (vCPUs) that are available to the product. A vCPU is a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual machine or a physical processor core. For IBM Blockchain Platform cost estimation purposes, 1 VPC = 1 CPU = 1 vCPU = 1 Core. The term \"VPC\" is also used to refer to a type of infrastructure on IBM Cloud and is unrelated to this topic.\n\nFor a total cost estimate, remember that your blockchain network consists of an Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud that contains IBM Blockchain Platform components and uses storage of your choice. Your Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud and the storage that you choose incur separate charges.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14886-1801-3922","score":0.786188364,"text":"\nBenefits \n\n\n\n BYOL \n\nRenting licenses can get expensive.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

Object Storage stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations.\n\nBy default, all objects that are stored in Object Storage are encrypted by using randomly generated keys and an all-or-nothing-transform (AONT). While this default encryption model provides at-rest security, financial service workloads need full control over the data encryption keys used. Again, Hyper Protect Crypto Services should be used for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using IBM Cloud services outside of a VPC \n\nTo connect to IBM Cloud services from your VPC, you need to use [Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE) for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe). In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12791-59012-61053","score":0.6906147599,"text":"\nBilling \n\nYou can give users access to update account settings, view subscriptions, view offers, apply subscription and feature codes, update spending limits, and track usage by using the Billing service.\n\n\n\nTable 4.

However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1068047-1069909","score":0.6620926857,"text":"\nIf you manage your invoices through the IBM Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking Manage > Billing and usage, and selecting Invoices.

When you are confident on the feature that you want to roll out is working as intended, increase the percentage over time.\n\nPercentage rollout uses a hashing algorithm that generates a hash based on the rule set. This hash is used by the SDK to generate a percentage value for that user. The percentage value generated for that user is compared to the value set for the percentage rollout value, determines whether the user is eligible to receive that feature or not.\n\nFor example, the hash has partitions from 1 to 100,000. When you assign a feature flag, the hash assigns values from 1 to 100,000 to users in each partition.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.7076066732,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-6798-8762","score":0.7494304776,"text":"\nOn the node you want to copy, click the More(images\/search_dialog.png)More icon][!!] icon, and then select Duplicate.\n2.

For example, you might group nodes that address questions about user accounts in a User account folder and nodes that handle payment-related queries in a Payment folder.\n* To group together a set of nodes that you want the dialog to process only if a certain condition is met. Use a condition, such as $isPlatinumMember, for example, to group together nodes that offer extra services that should only be processed if the current user is entitled to receive the extra services.\n* To hide nodes from the runtime while you work on them.

From the Dialog page, select any node in your dialog tree.\n2. Close the edit view if it is open for the current node.\n3. In your web browser's location field, a URL should display that has syntax similar to the following:\n\nhttps:\/\/{location}.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/{location}\/{instance-id}\/skills\/{skill-id}\/build\/dialognode={node-id}\n4. Edit the URL by replacing the current {node-id} value with the ID of the node you want to find, and then submit the new URL.\n5.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated before the current node in the dialog tree.

A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value. And when you add the mention to an existing entity value, it is also added to that entity value as new synonym.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\nTo learn more about creating intents, watch the following 2 1\/2-minute video.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02970-7-2198","score":0.7133170366,"text":"\nAdding entities \n\nEntities represent information in the user input that is relevant to the user's purpose.\n\nIf intents represent verbs (the action a user wants to do), entities represent nouns (the object of, or the context for, that action). For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue).

For each value, you specify a regular expression that defines the textual pattern of mentions of that value type. For an email entity value, you might want to specify a regular expression that defines a text@text.com pattern.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-entities"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1-1686","score":0.7078609467,"text":"\nFAQ library\n\nFilter:\n\nCategories\n\n\n\n1.\nAI \/ Machine Learning\n2.\nAnalytics\n3.

See [Creating skill versions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-versions).\n8. Deploy the version of the assistant into a test environment, and test it.\n\nIf you use the preview, you can share the URL with others to get their help with testing.\n9. Use metrics from the Analytics tab to find areas for improvement, and make adjustments.\n\nIf you need to test alternative approaches to addressing an issue, create a version for each solution, so you can deploy and test each one independently, and compare the results.\n10. When you are happy with the performance of your assistant, deploy the best version of the assistant into a production environment.\n11. Monitor the logs from conversations that users have with the deployed assistant.\n\nYou can view the logs for a version of a skill that is running in production from the Analytics tab of a development version of the skill. As you find misclassifications or other issues, you can correct them in the development version of the skill, and then deploy the improved version to production after testing. See [Improving across assistants](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-logslogs-deploy-id) for more details.\n\n\n\nThe process of analyzing the logs and improving the dialog skill is ongoing.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

For more information about deployments, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/workloads\/controllers\/deployment\/).\n\nPod\n: Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. Usually, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/workloads\/pods\/).\n\nApp\n: An app might refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You might deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate worker nodes.

For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like kube-system or ibm-system. If you don't designate a namespace when you create a Kubernetes resource, the resource is automatically created in the default namespace. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/overview\/working-with-objects\/namespaces\/).\n\nService\n: A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/service\/).\n\nDeployment\n: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-1160-2754","score":0.7192420363,"text":"\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/depmodels\/cloud\/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/training\/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/35-Connectivity.svg)](https:\/\/community.ibm.com\/community\/user\/publiccloud\/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06501-7-1686","score":0.7148670554,"text":"\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

First, you can upgrade to a paid [Standard plan](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan), which removes the write limitation immediately.

But existing users of the Standard plan can continue to use the plan indefinitely with no change in their pricing.

And, if they find that the Plus plan does not meet their needs for any reason, they can always downgrade back to their Standard plan.\n* What pricing plan do I need to use the service's customization interface?\n\nYou must have a paid plan (Plus, Standard, or Premium) to use language model or acoustic model customization. Users of the Lite plan cannot use customization. To use customization, users of the Lite plan must upgrade to a paid plan such as the Plus plan.\n* How do I upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan?\n\nYou can upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan, for example, to gain access to customization.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

For example, do not use periods, dashes, underscores, commas, end of sentence punctuation characters, and special characters such as dollar and euro signs, parentheses, brackets, and braces.\n* Use alphabetic characters that are valid for your language. For English, this includes a-z and A-Z. For other languages, valid characters can include accented letters or language-specific characters.\n* In English, substitute equivalent English letters for non-English or accented letters. For example, s for \u00e7, ny for \u00f1, or e for \u00e8.\n* Use real or made-up words that are pronounceable for words that are difficult to pronounce. For example, in English you can use the sounds-like shuchesnie for the word Sczcesny.\n* Use the spelling of numbers without dashes. For example, for the number 75, use seventy five in English, setenta y cinco in Spanish, and soixante quinze in French.\n* To pronounce a single letter, use the letter followed by a space. For example, use N C A A, notN. C. A. A., N.C.A.A., or NCAA.\n* You can include multiple words that are separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n* For most languages, the service enforces a maximum of 40 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces.\n* For Japanese, the service enforces a maximum limit of 25 total characters, not including leading or trailing spaces.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

It corrects misspellings in the input that customers submit before the input is evaluated. With more precise input, your assistant can more easily recognize entity mentions and understand the customer's intent. See [Correcting user input](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime-spell-check) for more details.\n\nThe new system entities are used by new skills\n: For new English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills, the new system entities are enabled automatically. If you decide to turn on a system entity and add it to your dialog, it's the new and improved version of the system entity that is used. For more information, see [New system entities](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities).\n\n\n\n\n\n 6 March 2020 \n\nTransfer a web chat conversation to a human agent\n: Delight your customers with 360-degree support by integrating your web chat with a third-party service desk solution. When a customer asks to speak to a person, you can connect them to an agent through a service desk solution, such as Zendesk or Salesforce.

However, if you close your account, any existing instances and keys are automatically hard deleted. Check out [Account cancelation and data deletion](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-complianceaccount-cancelation) for more information.\n\nIn the event that a key is no longer needed or should be removed, Key Protect allows you to delete and ultimately purge keys, an action that shreds the key material and makes any of the data encrypted with it inaccessible.\n\nDeleting a key moves it into a Destroyed state, a \"soft\" deletion in which the key can still be seen and restored for 30 days. After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame. After 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged. Note that once a key is no longer restorable and has been purged, its associated data can no longer be accessed. As a result, [destroying resources](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-compliancedata-deletion) is not recommended for production environments unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe following table lists the time frames in which you can view, restore, and purge a key after it has been deleted.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state.

This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever.

The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14408-1369-3126","score":0.6382396817,"text":"\n* Simple interconnectivity \u2013 logical network connections are established easily over any physical connection such as public internet, private VPN, or direct link.\n* Layer 2 extension \u2013 on-premises networks are extended into the cloud.

Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security controls for transmission confidentiality\/integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality\/integrity services are available in standard, commercial telecommunication service packages.

compensating security controls or explicitly accept the additional

The firewall is stateless until one of the following conditions is met:\n\n\n\n* Configuration of a firewall and any rule has a state parameter set\n* Configuration of a firewall state-policy\n* Configuration of NAT\n* Enablement of the transparent web proxy service\n* Enablement of a WAN load-balancing configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Stateless firewalls \n\nA stateless firewall considers every packet in isolation. Packets can be accepted or dropped according to only basic access control list (ACL) criteria, such as the source and destination fields in the IP or Transmission Control Protocols\/User Datagram Protocol (TCP\/UDP) headers. A stateless Brocade 5400 vRouter does not store connection information and has no requirement to look up every packet's relation to previous flows, both of which consume small amounts of memory and CPU time. Therefore, raw forwarding performance is best on a stateless system. Brocade recommends keeping the router stateless for best performance if you do not require the features specific to statefulness.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-adding-firewall-functions-to-vyatta-5400-stateless-and-stateful-"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1006129-1007999","score":0.650179863,"text":"\n* How can I filter internet-bound traffic and only allow specific protocols and destinations?\n\nThis is a common question when Source NAT and a firewall must be combined.\n\nKeep in mind the order of operations in the VRA you design your rulesets.\n\nIn short, firewall rules are applied after SNAT.\n\nTo block all outgoing traffic in a firewall, but allow specific SNAT flows, you must move the filtering logic onto your SNAT.

To obtain ground truth, you will want to spend time training and educating human annotators so that they can make the best judgments when analyzing domain content.\n\n\n\n Inter-annotator agreement \n\nAfter human annotators have annotated the documents, you must determine which documents to promote to ground truth.

Documents with low scores are candidates to be rejected and returned to the human annotator for improvement.\n\nWhen calculating inter-annotator agreement scores, the system examines all overlapping documents in all annotation sets in the task, regardless of the status of the sets. Because you cannot accept or reject annotation sets until they are in the Submitted status, you might not want to evaluate inter-annotator agreement until all annotation sets are submitted, or you might want to limit your review to only the human annotators who submitted their completed annotation sets.\n\nThe inter-annotator agreement scores show how different human annotators annotated mentions, relations, and coreference chains. You can view the scores by comparing a pair of human annotators (for example, compare all of John's mention annotations to all of Mary's mention annotations). You can also view the scores by comparing specific documents (for example, compare the relation annotations that John made in one document to the relation annotations that Mary made in the same document).\n\nTo help you identify areas that require investigation, scores that fall below the value that you specified for the inter-annotator agreement threshold are highlighted in red. In early stages of your annotation project, you might find that relation scores are often worse than mention scores because a perfect relation annotation requires that the mentions that define the relationship be in agreement first.\n\nThe score in the All column is a Fleiss Kappa score.

The machine learning model needs lots of examples to learn from. Adding more documents to the corpus might help. If your type system and documents are truly representative of a domain, you would expect to see that any randomly chosen documents contain a reasonable subset of the types.

Human annotators can sometimes be thorough about labeling entity type mentions, but be less diligent about annotating relation types and coreferences. For any key types that have a low percentage of corpus density, you might want to focus on finding more annotations of those type in the source documents.

If the overall performances scores for a test run differ greatly from the training run, it might be due to inconsistencies in the data sets used for each.\n* Don't waste time with incorrectly formatted documents. Text documents that you add to the corpus must be in UTF-8 format. If you converted document from other formats to use UTF-8 encoding, you might see diacritic marks and other issues with character normalization. Such incorrect formatting can lead to inaccurate token representation. If the word tokens used to represent a mention differ between documents, it weakens the example and negatively impacts machine learning.\n\n\n\n* Add type-specific documents\n\nIf you have a low percentage of documents that contain a certain type, it might mean that your corpus is not fully representative. The machine learning model needs lots of examples to learn from. Adding more documents to the corpus might help. If your type system and documents are truly representative of a domain, you would expect to see that any randomly chosen documents contain a reasonable subset of the types. Although not true in all cases, this situation is a signal for you to investigate your type system and the quality of the documents in the corpus. You might need to find more domain documents that better exercise the types that are under-performing. If recall is low, it is often an indication that you need to add more documents.\n* Annotate corpus more\n\nIf the machine learning model is having trouble finding instances of certain types then it might be because the ground truth does not contain enough examples of the type's usage. Human annotators can sometimes be thorough about labeling entity type mentions, but be less diligent about annotating relation types and coreferences.

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions. All objects in the bucket must be set with anonymous read or public read access.\n\nFor more information, see [Accelerate delivery of static files using a

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports\/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-cm-7"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16030-7-2126","score":0.6864580512,"text":"\nVPC behind the curtain \n\nThe following information presents a detailed conceptual picture of what's happening \"behind the curtain\" in VPC networking. Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13079-7-2117","score":0.6786569357,"text":"\nFAQs \n\nYou can read the following FAQs to help you with Hyper Protect Virtual Servers.\n\n\n\n Are there any backup functions provided for a virtual server? \n\nHyper Protect Virtual Servers does not provide any backup functions for your virtual server instances. If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 \/ 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance. Service availability is defined within the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Service Description](https:\/\/www-03.ibm.com\/software\/sla\/sladb.nsf\/pdf\/6605-17\/$file\/i126-6605-17_06-2019_en_US.pdf).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the data center have an impact on performance and reliability of a virtual server? \n\nNo, all of the data centers are of the same quality. For best availability, follow the hints in question [How do I provide my applications in high availability?]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16030-3224-5225","score":0.6784918904,"text":"\nSix different types of virtual server instance data packet flows occur in a VPC.

Packets flow between the virtual server instances on the hypervisor, and no packets leave the hypervisor.\n\nIntra-subnet, inter-host data flows - These flows involve packets that leave the hypervisor. Each packet is tagged with the proper VNI (virtualized network identifier) to maintain data isolation. The flows are then sent to the destination hypervisor that hosts the destination virtual server instance. The destination hypervisor strips off the VNI and forwards the data packet to the destination virtual server instance.\n\nInter-subnet, intra-zone data flows - These flows involve packets that use the VPC's implicit router function, which connects all subnets that are created in the VPC. It routes the data packet to the correct destination hypervisor. If the destination hypervisor is different from the source hypervisor, the data packet is tagged with the proper VNI and sent to the destination hypervisor. There, the VNI is stripped off and the data packet is forwarded to the destination virtual server instance. (These last steps are the same as described in the previous type of data flow.)\n\nInter-subnet, inter-zone data flows - For these flows, the implicit router function removes the VNI and forwards the packet in the VPC's MPLS VPN for transit across the cloud backbone. At the destination zone, the implicit router function tags the data packet with the appropriate VNI. Then, the packet is forwarded to the destination hypervisor, where the VNI is stripped off again so that the data packet can be forwarded to the destination virtual server instance.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13246-2783-4608","score":0.674668014,"text":"\n* [Virtual Network Functions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha) in combination with a Network Load Balancers to support a high availability and scalability.\n* Virtual private endpoint gateways.\n* DNS resolution.\n\n\n\nA layered architecture will introduce resources and demonstrate connectivity.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16295-7-1721","score":0.6826924682,"text":"\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You can also use a WebView to embed the web chat in your mobile app.\n\nFor detailed reference information about the web chat API, see the web chat [developer documentation](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=).\n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website or a WebView in your mobile app, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source (for more information about the embed script, see [Embedding the web chat on your page](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-web-chat)). Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":0.6997195482,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16387-7-1890","score":0.7133750916,"text":"\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public\/private key pair.

Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02855-1612-3501","score":0.6325901747,"text":"\nSets the color of interactive elements, including:\n\n\n\n* Chat launcher button that is embedded in your web page\n* Send button associated with the input text field\n* Input text field border when in focus\n* Marker that shows the start of the assistant\u2019s response\n* Border of a button after it is clicked\n* Border of the drop-down list field as the user chooses an option\n* Typing indicator that is shown to repesent a pause response\n\n\n\n* Assistant image: This image is displayed in the web chat header along with the assistant name to represent your assistant or organization.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03196-30333-32476","score":0.695158422,"text":"\nIn the Message before link to web chat field, edit the introductory message to display to the user (in the originating channel) before the link that initiates the transfer. By default, this message is OK, click this link for additional help. Chat will continue on a new web page.\n3. In the URL to web chat field, type the URL for your website where the web chat widget is embedded.\n\n\n\nIn the integration that processes the Channel transfer response, the introductory message is displayed, followed by a link to the URL you specify. The user must then click the link to initiate the transfer.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred from one channel to another, the session history and context are preserved, so the destination channel can continue the conversation from where it left off. Note that the message output that contains the Channel transfer response is processed first by the channel that initiates the transfer, and then by the target channel. If the output contains multiple responses (perhaps using different response types), these will be processed by both channels (before and after the transfer). If you want to target individual responses to specific channels, you can do so by editing the response using the JSON editor. For more information, see [Targeting specific integrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-responses-jsondialog-responses-json-target-integrations).\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding an Image response type \n\nSometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Include images in your response to do things like illustrate a concept, show off merchandise for sale, or maybe to show a map of your store location.\n\nTo add an Image response type, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Choose Image.\n2. Add the full URL to the hosted image file into the Image source field.\n\nThe image must be in .jpg, .gif, or .png format. The image file must be stored in a location that is publicly addressable by an https: URL.\n\nFor example: https:\/\/www.example.com\/assets\/common\/logo.png.\n\nIf you want to display an image title and description above the embedded image in the response, then add them in the fields provided.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03285-30741-32088","score":0.6951118112,"text":"\n\"text\": \"I will send you a text message now with a link to our website.\"\n}\n],\n\"selection_policy\": \"sequential\"\n},\n{\n\"response_type\": \"channel_transfer\",\n\"message_to_user\": \"Click the link to connect with an agent using our website.\",\n\"transfer_info\": {\n\"target\": {\n\"chat\": {\n\"url\": \"https:\/\/example.com\/webchat\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n]\n}\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Ending the call \n\nYou can instruct your assistant end a phone call by using the end_session response type, as shown in this example.\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"end_session\"\n}\n]\n}\n}\n\nYou can optionally include custom headers to include with the SIP BYE request that is generated when the phone integration receives this response type.\n\nThis example shows the end_session response type with custom SIP headers:\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"end_session\",\n\"channel_options\": {\n\"voice_telephony\": {\n\"sip\": {\n\"headers\":\n{\n\"name\": \"Customer-Header1\",\n\"value\": \"Some-Custom-Info\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"User-to-User\",\n\"value\": \"XXXXXX\"\n}\n]\n}\n}\n}\n}\n]\n}\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Sending a text message during a phone conversation \n\nThere are some situations when it is useful to be able to send a text message during an ongoing voice. For example, you might want the customer to specify a street address, which is easier to communicate accurately in writing than by transcribing voice input.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-voice-actions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":0.6917278767,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant.

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-index"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09921-1508-2973","score":0.7186757326,"text":"\nsatisfied An affective response to perceived service quality \n sympathetic An affective mode of understanding that involves emotional resonance \n\n\n\n\n\n* Example response:\n\n{\n\"usage\": {\n\"text_units\": 1,\n\"text_characters\": 60,\n\"features\": 1\n},\n\"language\": \"en\",\n\"classifications\": [\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.564849,\n\"class_name\": \"excited\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.355816,\n\"class_name\": \"satisfied\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.126127,\n\"class_name\": \"polite\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.026995,\n\"class_name\": \"sympathetic\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.012211,\n\"class_name\": \"frustrated\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.011065,\n\"class_name\": \"sad\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.000872,\n\"class_name\": \"impolite\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Migrating from Watson Tone Analyzer Customer Engagement endpoint to Natural Language Understanding \n\nYou can migrate your [Watson Tone Analyzer customer-engagement](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/tone-analyzer?topic=tone-analyzer-utco) analysis requests to Natural Language Understanding.

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03363-4-2165","score":0.7166103721,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-27244-29158","score":0.6626488566,"text":"\n* Enhanced intent recognition and enhanced irrelevance detection\n* Enhanced intent recognition and existing irrelevance detection\n* Existing intent recognition and enhanced irrelevance detection\n* Existing intent recognition and existing irrelevance detection\n\n\n\nFor French, Italian, and Spanish, you can use the API to set your assistant to these combinations:\n\n\n\n* Enhanced intent recognition and enhanced irrelevance detection\n* Existing intent recognition and existing irrelevance detection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15 September 2021 \n\nDialog skill \"Try it out\" improvements\n: The Try it out pane now includes these changes:\n\n\n\n* It now includes runtime warnings in addition to runtime errors.\n* For dialog skills, the Try it out pane now uses the [React](https:\/\/reactjs.org\/) UI framework similar to the rest of the Watson Assistant user interface.
