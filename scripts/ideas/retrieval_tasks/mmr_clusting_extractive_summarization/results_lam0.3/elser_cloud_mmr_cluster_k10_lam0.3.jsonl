The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

Additional logic would need to be established to determine when to pull a region out of rotation. This monitoring logic could use a [circuit break pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html) similar to the active/passive configuration or rely on a separate dedicated monitoring framework that determines region health.

(Per-minute pricing is different for the Standard plan.)\n\nFor information about pricing for the Plus and Standard plans, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://%7BDomainName%7D/catalog/speech-to-text).\n* Do you round up to the nearest minute for every call to the API?\n\nIBM does not round up the length of the audio for every API call that the service receives. Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.\n* Am I charged for all audio that I send, even audio that does not include speech?\n\nYes, all audio that you send to the service contributes to your cumulative minutes of audio. This includes silence and noisy audio that does not contain or otherwise contribute to speech recognition. Because the service must process all audio that it receives, it does not distinguish between the type or quality of audio that you send. For pricing purposes, three seconds of silence is equivalent to three seconds of actual speech.\n* What advantages do I get by using a Speech to Text Premium plan?\n\nThe Premium plan offers developers and organizations all of the capabilities and features of the Plus plan. The plan also offers these additional features:\n\n\n\n* The ability to use IBM Watson\u00ae services in the IBM Cloud\u00ae with data isolation and added security features such as IBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae (also referred to as Bring your own keys (BYOK)), Service Endpoints, Mutual Authentication, and US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) readiness.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09795-1650-3805", "score": 9.593958, "text": "\nIn your monthly usage charges, consumption is measured hourly and your bill breaks down into the following concepts:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}]}

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test?

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\nAll Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by Hyper Protect Crypto Services.

Although the methods described here were designed and tested with COS, they can work for certain other IBM Cloud services.\n\nBy policy, IBM Cloud Direct Link denies access to IBM Cloud private service endpoints, including those endpoints used by COS. The technique that is described in this document relies on indirect access to COS through servers hosted in a customer's IBM Cloud account. After setup, each customer's server can forward traffic bidirectionally between IBM Cloud private service endpoints and their remote networks that are connected by Direct Link.\n\n\n\n What is IBM Cloud Object Storage? \n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) is a web-scale solution that stores unstructured data. It provides reliability, security, availability, and disaster recovery without manual replication.\n\nThe information that is stored within IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted and dispersed across many geographic locations. It's accessible through an implementation of the S3 API. This service uses distributed storage technologies that are provided by the IBM Cloud Object Storage service.\n\nIBM COS is available in three configurations:\n\n\n\n* Cross Region service provides higher durability and availability than using a single region, but at the cost of slightly higher latency. This service is available today in the US and the EU. By using a Virtual Router Appliance (VRA), you also might use Direct Link to connect to COS in the Asia Pacific region.\n* Regional service provides the reverse. It distributes objects across many availability zones within a single region. If a region or availability zone is inaccessible, the object store continues to function smoothly. Any missed changes are applied when the inaccessible data center comes back online.\n* Single Site service offers affordable access to COS in a selected data center.\n\n\n\n\n\n COS private and public endpoints \n\nEndpoints are URLs that applications use to issue COS commands and exchange data with COS. Every endpoint uses the same application programming interface (API) to interact with COS.\n\nServers that are provisioned within IBM Cloud use private API endpoints for services, including COS.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-using-ibm-cloud-direct-link-to-connect-to-ibm-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10864-7221-9477", "score": 18.17008, "text": "\nSupported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them. This technology is the \u201ccognitive\u201d extension of the [Data Processing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_casesuse_cases_data) use case that was discussed earlier. Another good use for Cloud Functions is to implement Bot function that is combined with cognitive services.\n\nA sample application, [Dark vision](https://github.com/IBM-cloud/openwhisk-darkvisionapp), is provided and does just that. In this application, the user uploads a video or image by using the Dark Vision web application, which stores it in an IBM Cloudant DB. Once the video is uploaded, Cloud Functions detect the new video by listening to IBM Cloudant changes (trigger). Cloud Functions then triggers the video extractor action. During its execution, the extractor produces frames (images) and stores them in IBM Cloudant. The frames are then processed with Watson Visual Recognition, and the results are stored in the same IBM Cloudant DB. The results can be viewed by using the Dark Vision web application or an iOS application. IBM Cloud Object Storage can be used in addition to IBM Cloudant, where video and image metadata are stored in IBM Cloudant, and the media files are stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n Event processing with Kafka or Event Streams \n\nCloud Functions is ideally to be used in combination with Kafka, IBM\u00ae Event Streams for IBM Cloud\u00ae (Kafka based), and other messaging systems.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05167-7-1758", "score": 18.082432, "text": "\nUpload data \n\nAfter getting your storage organized into buckets, it's time to add some objects by uploading data.\n\nDepending on how you want to use your storage, there are different ways to get data into the system. A data scientist has a few large files that are used for analytics, a systems administrator needs to keep database backups synchronized with local files, and a developer is writing software that needs to read and write millions of files. Each of these scenarios is best served by different methods of data ingest.\n\nSome applications may wish to restrict a user or Service ID to only uploading data, without any access to reading data in a bucket. This is possible through the Object Writer [IAM role](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam).\n\n\n\n Using the console \n\nTypically, using the web-based console is not the most common way to use Object Storage. Objects are limited to 200 MB and the file name and key are identical. Multiple objects can be uploaded at the same time, and if the browser allows for multiple threads each object will be uploaded by using multiple parts in parallel.

IT expenses soared because hardware quickly went out of date and wasn't utilized fully. While they waited for hardware provisioning, their regulatory compliance slowed.\n\n\n\n Context \n\nTo improve risk analysis, the company looked to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Analytic services to reduce costs, increase worldwide availability, and ultimately accelerate regulatory compliance. With Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud in multiple regions, their analysis apps can be containerized and deployed across the globe, improving availability and addressing local regulations. Those deployments are accelerated with familiar open source tools, already part of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\nThey started by containerizing the analysis apps and putting them in the cloud. In a flash, their hardware headaches went away. They were able to easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their high-performance CPU, RAM, storage, and security needs. And when their analysis apps change, they can add or shrink compute without huge hardware investments. With the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system.

It does not include queries that are submitted from the search bar on the Improve and customize page of the product user interface.\n\nA query is counted only if the request is successful, meaning it returns a response (with message code 200).\n\nThe number of search queries that you can submit per month per service instance depends on your Discovery plan type.\n\n\n\nNumber of queries per month", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07178-1595-3651", "score": 9.306634, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Confidence scores](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-toolingconfidence).\n* Discovery returns query results that include special characters for the following languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, and Portuguese. For example, if you query for aqui, you receive results for both aqui and aqu\u00ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Options for querying \n\n\n\n* You have the option to turn on passage retrieval. Passages are short, relevant excerpts extracted from the full documents returned by your query. By default, up to 10 passages of around 400 characters each are returned for a query. A maximum of three passages are extracted from a single result. The passages parameter is only available for private collections; it is not available in the Discovery News collection. For more information about how passages are identified, see [Passages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parameterspassages).\n* You can create longer, more complex queries that include multiple filters and complex aggregations.

How these 60 passages are chosen differs based on the passages.per_document parameter value.\n\n\n\n* If passages.per_document is false, the top 60 passages from all of the documents that are returned by search are chosen based on their passage scores only.\n* If passages.per_document is true, the returned documents are ranked first, and then the top 60 passages from these top documents are chosen.\n\nFor example, if you set the query to return 100 documents (count=100) and ask for 2 passages from each document (passages.max_per_document=2), then 2 passages are chosen from each of the 30 top-ranked documents (2 x 30 = 60 passages) only. No passages are chosen from the remaining 70 documents.\n\n\n\nIf your goal is to get the best 10 short answers, a good approach is to give the answer-finding feature various passages from more documents than just the top 10.

The answer-finding feature searches for answers in up to 20*3 = 60 passages.\n\nAnswer finding does not use the transformed query string that is generated by query analysis.

To this end, IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management roles can be assigned in varying combinations, depending on the level of administration in question.\n\nThese varying kinds of access are analogous to many kinds of life situations. A person might be the founder and CEO of a company and yet only be a regular member of a local club, and likewise have no authority at all to write traffic tickets. In a similar way, Key Protect roles are assigned within the context of a specific part of Key Protect, although to make things simpler, Key Protect does define \"default\" roles over certain resources unless specified otherwise (which we'll discuss in more detail later).\n\nThere are two main areas of administration for almost all IBM Cloud products: the account (also known as the \"platform\"), and the service instances owned by the account. A large bank, for example, might have only one account (controlled by executive leadership) and separate service instances for each of the organizational units within the bank (for example, one unit might manage bank accounts while another manages loans). While it is likely that users with rights at the account level will also have rights over the various instances (and perhaps, though not always, the other way around), note that the names given to account roles are different than those for the roles within the service instances, reflecting this difference between account roles and service instance roles. For more information on those roles, their names, and their permissions, check out [IAM roles and actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions).\n\n\n\n How IAM access works \n\nAfter you set up and organize resource groups in your account, you can take advantage of a couple of strategies to streamline the access management process:\n\nAccess groups", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12545-7-2359", "score": 20.483444, "text": "\nUser management for enterprises \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae enterprises are valuable for large companies or organizations that need to group a set of accounts while still maintaining a separation and isolation between the accounts for different departments or teams.

This means the users who are invited to the enterprise and the users who are invited to the accounts within the enterprise remain entirely separate. This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources. If you add a user to an enterprise account that contains a number of accounts, those users do not automatically have access to manage those accounts as far as user management, billing, and more. The enterprise account users also don't have access to any resources in other accounts within the enterprise.\n\nIf you want a user to manage the enterprise and have access to resources within child accounts, you must invite them to both accounts.

You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view.

If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise.

Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ac-2"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03749-3299-5633", "score": 16.545576, "text": "\nHowever, you can still import these accounts into your enterprise by converting them to Subscription accounts and then importing them. To convert an account, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule).\n\nEach enterprise supports only a single billing currency. All accounts must use the enterprise billing currency before you add them to the enterprise. Existing accounts that are imported into the enterprise no longer separately manage their billing. As a result, subscription credit can't be added to individual child accounts. Subscription credit must be added to the enterprise account, where it becomes part of the enterprise credit pool.\n\n\n\n Billing transition when importing accounts \n\nWhen you import an existing account to an enterprise, its billing and invoicing transitions to being managed by the enterprise account. This transition includes the following changes to the account.\n\n\n\n* For Subscription accounts that are added, the account type is changed to Pay-As-You-Go. This change reflects that the account does not have its own subscriptions, but it still has full access to production-ready, billable services.\n* Subscriptions and promotions from each account are moved to the enterprise account, where they become part of the credit pool. After the move, each subscription has the same remaining credit and term period, but the subscription is given a new unique ID.\n* Access to billing and payment information for future billing periods is restricted to users in the enterprise account. Users in a child account can't access billing and payment information, such as invoices, payments, or subscriptions, even if they previously had access in the account. To view or manage billing, users need to be invited to the enterprise account and given access to the Billing service in that account.\n* Usage is invoiced to the enterprise account for the entire month when the account was added. For example, if you add an account to the enterprise on 15 June, all of the usage for the month of June is reflected in the July invoice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shared credit pool \n\nThe enterprise credit pool consolidates credit from all accounts in the enterprise and shares it with the accounts.

This capability's usefulness depends on your enterprise structure because usage data is aggregated by each account group and account. Create account groups for projects that function under a common budget. See [How can I use an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterpriseenterprise-use-cases) for examples.\n\nThe enterprise administrator or your financial officer might not be familiar with each individual account or account group. To make it easier to identify their purpose, give each account and account group a human-readable name. If your company uses billing codes, you can also incorporate them into the name. For example, instead of a devteam account group with fed ui and be api accounts, create the Development - A2B3 account group with Front-end UI team and Back-end API team accounts.\n\nAn enterprise user with Administrator or Editor access can edit the enterprise and account group names, but they can't change account names. To edit an account name, a user must be in the account itself.\n\nBecause you have a unified view of all usage that's organized by your account groups and accounts, you can charge back usage costs to the associated teams. For more information, see [Recovering costs for enterprise usage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usageenterprise-cost-recovery).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a consistent enterprise hierarchy \n\nWhen you set up your enterprise, you create an enterprise hierarchy that reflects your company or organization.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-enterprise-best-practices"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12623-9865-12441", "score": 8.58471, "text": "\nJust because a user is invited and given access to manage the entire enterprise, it doesn't mean that they can view the users who are invited to each child account.

This separation means that users who manage your enterprise can't access account resources within the child accounts unless you specifically enable them to. For example, your financial officer can have the Administrator role on the Billing account management service within the enterprise account, which provides them access to billing and payment information and usage data down to the resource type.

This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources.

Subscription billing means that you purchase a subscription for an amount of credit to spend during the subscription term, and usage is deducted from the subscription credit at a discounted rate. Subscription credit, as well as credit from any promotions, is added to the enterprise credit pool, which is shared across all accounts in the enterprise. As accounts use resources, credit is spent from the credit pool. The Pay as you go with Committed Use billing model is similar to the billing model for Subscription accounts. You commit to spend a certain amount on IBM Cloud and receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount.\n\nZoom\n\n![A diagram that shows that credit from accounts is added to the enterprise credit pool, which is managed by the billing administrator in the enterprise account.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/d4595e5202a9a27767cf034e81b038cdf772e0d5/secure-enterprise/images/enterprise-billing.svg)\n\nFigure 2.

This unified view of your credit spending means you can right-size your subscriptions across all of your usage to make sure you're getting the best deal.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3.

This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it.

Data skipping indexes apply to structured data sets in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage and store summary metadata for each object in the data set. The indexes are stored in Cloud Object Storage in a user-provided bucket, similarly to the data. SQL queries benefit from an index by skipping over all objects whose metadata indicates that they are not relevant to the indicated query.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\n\n\n* Boosts performance of your queries\n* Reduces cost of your queries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nFor each of the columns in an object, summary metadata can include minimum and maximum values, a list or bloom filter of the appearing values, or other metadata that represents the data in that column. The summary metadata is then used during query evaluation to skip over objects that do not contain any relevant data. All formats are supported, including Parquet, ORC, CSV, and JSON. Data skipping is used for performance optimization. Data skipping does not affect the content of query results. IBM Cloud\u00ae Data Engine currently supports metaindexes only. Metaindexes are indexes on a higher level, thus they index objects instead of rows.\n\nAs Data Engine charges on a per-query basis based on the amount of data scanned, reducing the number of bytes scanned per query, reduces cost while it improves performance. For data skipping to work well and for good performance overall, use the [best practices for data layout](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout), such as using the Parquet format and adopting Hive-style partitioning. Ideally, create tables by using the [Cloud Object Storage catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-hivemetastore). Data skipping complements these best practices and provides significant cost savings and performance benefits.\n\nTo use this feature, you must create indexes on one or more columns of the data set. Start by indexing columns that you query most often in the WHERE clause. A full stop (\".\") in any column name is not supported.\n\nThe following four index types are supported:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-index_management"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-1605-3435", "score": 16.890942, "text": "\nThus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

The following best practices help to avoid such issues:\n\n\n\n* Prepare your data first. Transform input formats, such as .csv or .json to a compressed format, such as Parquet.\n* Write results into [partitioned result sets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencepartitionedClause).

Some input objects can contain more columns than others, but common columns must always use the same order across objects. The number of columns in the composite input is the maximum number of columns from all matched objects.\n* For JSON and Parquet format, columns are matched based on their name. The set of columns in the composite input is the union of all column names from matched objects. For Parquet format, you must use the MERGE SCHEMA option of the [STORED AS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceexternalTableSpec) clause to indicate that schema merging is to be performed.\n* Input schema merging is not supported for AVRO and ORC formats. The first object determines the set of columns in the composite input, all columns that do not occur in the first object are ignored. The same behavior applies to Parquet, if the MERGE SCHEMA option is not specified.\n\n\n\nMatching columns must have compatible data types across all objects where they appear.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions. For more information, see the section on [partitioned tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogpartitioned).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09950-7-1844", "score": 18.53588, "text": "\nTables \n\nIn the table from the Tables tab, the value that is displayed in the row count column is an approximate.

For all these reasons, it is important to pick the appropriate data type.\n3. Specify whether Not null is true or false.\nA column that allows NULL values also allows rows to be inserted with no value in that column. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value.\n4. Specify the default value to be used if no value is specified when a row is inserted.\n5.

They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. It also has some powerful counting aggregations suitable for drill-down user interfaces.\n\nIBM Cloudant Search also powers type=text IBM Cloudant Query indexes, so a subset of its capabilities is surfaced by using the _find API.\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Under the hood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Under the hood video \n\nLearn how the IBM Cloudant service is organized.\n\n\n\n* Under the hood video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 17 - Under the hood.\n\nLet's look at how an IBM Cloudant service is organized: This overview applies to the IBM Cloudant services that map to CouchDB 2 and 3. CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00646-3898-5632", "score": 21.781174, "text": "\nFor example, when your webpage is first loaded, it calls the GET /todolist endpoint. The GET /todolist endpoint uses the postFind method to query the database for all documents (by using the index created after the todo database), and then orders the notes by timestamp, and returns them to the front end for display.\n\nFiltering by tag uses the same postFind method, but by using the second index, you create and delete notes by using the postDocument and deleteDocument methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIBM Cloudant allows rapid development of web applications, as its HTTP API is modeled by the [Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm-cloud/cloudant) and is easy to integrate with your own code. You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant).

The [IBM Cloudant Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-connectingibm-cloudant-dashboard) is a great way to explore your databases, create and modify documents, and refine your index and querying skills.\n\nYou can find more best practice guidance in our [blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/11/21/Best-and-Worst-Practices.html) and [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant/getting-started.html).

Create some sample data that represents a book in a library as shown in the following example:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"BXP9G5ZQY9Q4EA13\",\n\"author\": \"Dickens\",\n\"title\": \"David Copperfield\",\n\"year\": 1840,\n\"pages\": 723,\n\"publisher\": \"Penguin\",\n\"url\": \"https://www.somurl.com/dc\"\n}\n3. Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3. A report that details the number of books that are published by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens. This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. It also has some powerful counting aggregations suitable for drill-down user interfaces.\n\nIBM Cloudant Search also powers type=text IBM Cloudant Query indexes, so a subset of its capabilities is surfaced by using the _find API.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00472-16393-17597", "score": 21.16656, "text": "\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to query a global index:\n\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\n\nSee the following example that uses the command line to query a global index:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl \"https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1\"\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostSearchOptions;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.SearchResult;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nPostSearchOptions searchOptions = new PostSearchOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"<db-name>\")\n.ddoc(\"<ddoc>\")\n.index(\"<index-name>\")\n.query(\":\")\n.includeDocs(true)\n.limit(1)\n.build();\n\nSearchResult response =\nservice.postSearch(searchOptions).execute()\n.getResult();\n\nSystem.out.println(response);\n\nimport { CloudantV1 } from '@ibm-cloud/cloudant';\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({});\n\nservice.postSearch({\ndb: '<db-name>',\nddoc: '<ddoc>',\nindex: '<index-name>',\nquery: ':',\nincludeDocs: true,\nlimit: 1", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-60601-62822", "score": 21.135118, "text": "\nWhen you create a secondary index, you choose whether its purpose is for per-partition or global scope.\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00539-7-1755", "score": 21.024532, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloudant Query FAQ \n\n[IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query) is an API for querying slices of data based on the values of a database's document attributes. It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00469-13046-15136", "score": 20.971407, "text": "\nYou might find that you\u2019re mainly hitting the Query limit, but you have plenty of headroom in Lookups. It might be possible to reduce the reliance on Queries through some remodeling of the data or perhaps doing more work client-side.\n\nThe corollary here though is that you can\u2019t assume that any third-party library or framework optimizes for cost ahead of convenience. Client-side frameworks that support multiple persistence layers by using plug-ins are unlikely to be aware of this situation, or might be incapable of making such tradeoffs.\n\nChecking for third-party library or framework compatibility before you commit to a particular tool is a good idea.\n\nIt is also worth understanding that the rates aren\u2019t directly equivalent to HTTP API endpoint calls. You must expect that, for example, a bulk update counts according to its constituent document writes.\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant documentation on [plans and pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public) on IBM public cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Logging helps you see what\u2019s going on \n\nIBM Cloudant\u2019s logs indicating each API call made, what was requested and how long it took to respond can be automatically spooled to LogDNA for analysis and reporting for IBM Cloud-based services.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 20.896208, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century. The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Indexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Indexing video \n\nLearn how indexing can speed up your query process.\n\n\n\n* Indexing video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 11 - Indexing.\n\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}]}

For more information, see [What is IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n5. IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager: You can store your Ingress and Kubernetes secrets in IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager. When you integrate Secrets Manager into your cluster, you set a default Secrets Manager instance where all Ingress subdomain secrets are uploaded. For more information, see [Setting up Secrets Manager in your Kubernetes Service cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Image and registry \n\nEvery deployment is based on an image that holds the instructions for how to spin up the container that runs your app. These instructions include the operating system inside the container and extra software that you want to install. To protect your app, you must protect the image and establish checks to ensure the image's integrity.\n\nShould I use a public or a private registry to store my images?\n: Public registries, such as Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker images and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01415-6473-8616", "score": 18.202818, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Billing for storage and pull traffic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_billing_traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can images from other registries be scanned? \n\nVulnerability Advisor scans images from IBM Cloud Container Registry only.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is a Vulnerability Advisor scan triggered? \n\nFor more information about how the scanning of an image is triggered, see [Vulnerable packages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index&interface=uipackages).\n\n\n\n\n\n Why doesn't a new image scan? \n\nIf you get the vulnerability report immediately after you add the image to the\n\nregistry, you might receive the following error:\n\nBXNVA0009E: <imagename> has not been scanned. Try again later.\nIf this issue persists, contact support for help;\nsee https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-supportgetting-customer-support\n\nYou receive this message because the images are scanned asynchronously to the requests for results, and the scanning process takes a while to complete. During normal operation, the scan completes within the first few minutes after you add the image to the registry. The time that it takes to complete depends on variables like the image size and the amount of traffic that the registry is receiving.\n\nIf you get this message as part of a build pipeline and you see this error regularly, try adding some retry logic that contains a short pause.\n\nIf you still see unacceptable performance, contact support, see [Getting help and support for Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-help-and-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n How often are the security notices updated? \n\nSecurity notices for Vulnerability Advisor are loaded from the vendors' operating system sites approximately every 12 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why can I see a vulnerability in Vulnerability Advisor v4 but not in v3? \n\nSome vulnerabilities are picked up earlier by Vulnerability Advisor version 4 than by version 3 because version 4 uses a different architecture and a different scanning engine.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_faq&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01535-4-2366", "score": 18.079916, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

Updating the Container Registry CLI plug-in to version 1.0.0, or later, enables the ibmcloud cr va command and the --va option on the ibmcloud cr images and ibmcloud cr digests commands to work with Vulnerability Advisor version 4.\n\nOn 19 June 2023, when the default changes to Vulnerability Advisor version 4, the Container Registry CLI automatically starts to use this version unless the ibmcloud cr va-version-set v3 command was run, in which case Vulnerability Advisor version 3 continues to be used. You can use the ibmcloud cr va-version command to determine which Vulnerability Advisor version is being used and the ibmcloud cr va-version-set v4 command to switch to Vulnerability Advisor version 4. When Vulnerability Advisor version 3 reaches its end of support date, any Container Registry CLI commands that access Vulnerability Advisor version 3 cease to work. An end of support date is not available yet.\n\nIf you use the Vulnerability Advisor REST API to access Vulnerability Advisor, you must update your client call from /va/api/v3 APIs to /va/api/v4 APIs.\n\nIf you use one of the Vulnerability Advisor version 3 SDKs to access Vulnerability Advisor, you must update to the Vulnerability Advisor version 4 SDK.\n\nAny exemptions that you previously defined continue to work.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01442-1679-3832", "score": 18.269657, "text": "\nWhen Vulnerability Advisor version 3 reaches its end of support date, any Container Registry CLI commands that access Vulnerability Advisor version 3 cease to work.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata.

Users can choose between the SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise solution.\n\nAn ERP system is used for demand-oriented business resource planning. It is used to control processes and to link departments and functional areas in a meaningful way. Individual modules include applications for accounting, sales, production, and marketing. More complex tasks in customer or supply chain management can also be done by ERP software. As the successor to the core product SAP ECC, SAP S/4HANA was presented as the intelligent ERP system of the new generation. Thanks to modern technologies, the Software as Service (SaaS) version is designed to help companies standardize processes and make the leap to digitalization.\n\nWhile previous SAP ERP solutions support the most common databases, SAP S/4HANA uses exclusively the SAP HANA in-memory database developed by SAP. This in-memory database offers users the greatest technical benefit and they benefit from increased performance. The \"S\" in S/4HANA stands for \"simple\", while the \"4\" refers to the generation sequence. Compared to the SAP core product SAP ECC, which is still used in most companies, SAP S/4HANA offers many innovative functions that revolutionize the system landscape from the ground up. As SAP plans to discontinue the mainstream maintenance of its existing ERP solutions by 2027, many SAP ECC users are already considering a migration to SAP HA SZ S/4HANA\n\n\n\n\n\n What is created \n\nThe scripts work in two phases.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-automate-s4hana-ha-terraform-ansible"}]}

The automation level is set to fully automated so that initial placement and migration recommendations are run automatically by vSphere. Additionally, the migration threshold is set to moderate so that vCenter applies priority 1, 2, 3 recommendations to achieve at least a decent improvement in the load balance of the cluster.\n\nPower management through the Distributed Power Management feature is not used in this design.\n\n\n\n\n\n vSphere High Availability \n\nThis design uses vSphere High Availability (HA) in the initial cluster and in the additional clusters to detect compute failures and recover VMs that run in a cluster. The vSphere HA feature in this design is configured with both the Host Monitoring and Admission Control options that are enabled in the cluster. Additionally, the initial cluster reserves one node\u2019s resources as spare capacity for the admission control policy.\n\nYou are responsible to adjust the admission control policy when the cluster is later expanded or contracted.\n\nBy default, the VM restart priority option is set to medium and the Host isolation response option is disabled.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-design_infrastructuremgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11587-1459-3556", "score": 10.142684, "text": "\nSummary of an SAP landscape installation onto Cloud IaaS \n\nThis table summarizes the SAP landscape installation steps for you and your team:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install.

See the following descriptions:\n\n\n\n1. At index-time, choose the {store: true} option. This option indicates that the field you're dealing with needs to be stored inside the index. A field can be \"stored\" even if it isn't used for indexing itself. For example, you might want to \"store\" a telephone number, even if your search algorithm doesn't include searching by phone number.\n2. At query-time, pass ?include_docs=true to indicate to IBM Cloud that you want the entire body of each matching document to be returned.\n\n\n\nThe first option means you have a larger index, but it's the fastest way of retrieving data. The second option keeps the index small, but adds extra query-time work for IBM Cloud as it must fetch document bodies after the search result set is calculated. This process can be slower to run and adds a further burden to the IBM Cloud cluster.\n\nIf possible, choose the first option use the following guidelines:\n\n\n\n* Index only the fields that you want to be searchable.\n* Store only the fields that you need to retrieve at query-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Entity extraction \n\nProviding a good search experience depends on the alignment of your users' search needs with structure in the data. Running lots of unstructured data with an indexing engine gets you only so far. If you can add further structure to unstructured data, then the search experience benefits since fewer \"false positives\" are returned. Look at this example:\n\n\"Edinson Cavani scored two superb goals as Uruguay beat Portugal to set up a World Cup quarter-final meeting with France.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-search-analyzers"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00634-4405-6200", "score": 8.719222, "text": "\n{\"tokens\":[\"four\",\"score\",\"seven\",\"year\",\"ago\",\"our\",\"father\",\"brought\",\"forth\",\"contin\",\"new\",\"nation\",\"conceiv\",\"liberti\",\"dedic\",\"proposit\",\"all\",\"men\",\"creat\",\"equal\"]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Which analyzer must I pick? \n\nIt depends on your data. If your data is structured (email addresses, postal codes, names, and so on) in separate fields, then select an analyzer that retains the data you need to search.\n\nOnly index the fields that you need. Keeping the index small helps to improve performance.\n\nConsider the common data sources and look at the best analyzer choices.\n\n\n\n Names \n\nIt's likely that name fields must use an analyzer that doesn't stem words. The White space analyzer keeps the words' case (meaning the search terms must be full, case-sensitive matches) and leaves double-barreled names intact. If you want to split up double-barreled names, then the Standard analyzer can do the job.\n\n\n\n\n\n Email addresses \n\nThe built-in email analyzer serves this purpose, which changes everything to lowercase and then behaves like the Keyword analyzer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Unique ID \n\nOrder numbers, payment references, and UUIDs such as \"A1324S\", \"PayPal0000445\", and \"ABC-1412-BBG\" must be kept without any pre-processing, so the Keyword analyzer is preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n Country codes \n\nCountry codes like \"UK\" must also use the Keyword analyzer to prevent the removal of \"stopwords\" that match the country codes, for example, \"IN\" for India.

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more. For the full list of aggregation options, see the [Aggregations table](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-aggregations).

For the WebSocket interface, the underlying TCP connection remains idle while the service prepares the response. Therefore, the connection can close due to a timeout. To avoid the timeout with the WebSocket interface, request interim results (\"interim_results\": \"true\") in the JSON for the start message to initiate the request. You can discard the interim results if you do not need them.

A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region. When the failover needs to be manually triggered, make the following changes:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-failover"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03312-5487-7760", "score": 17.89459, "text": "\nIf a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. For more information, see [Configuring backup call center support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-transfer-service).\n* Call failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent.\n\n\n\nIf, after you transfer the call to a human, the connection to a live agent fails for any reason, you can configure what to do.\n\n\n\n* Transfer failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller if transfer to a live agent fails. The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-failover"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16321-20604-22275", "score": 15.611371, "text": "\n\"message\": \"Sorry, I could not find an agent.\"\n},\n\"message_to_human_agent\": \"The caller needs help resetting their password\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Transferring upon failure \n\nTo configure transfer on failures, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings.

If User-to-User is specified in the transfer_headers list, the session history key is sent in the X-Watson-Assistant-Session-History-Key header.\n\nThe value of the SIP header is limited to 1024 bytes.\n\nHow this data is presented in the SIP REFER message also depends on the value of transfer_headers_send_method(as defined in [Generic Service Desk SIP Parameters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsgeneric-service-desk-sip-parameters)).\n\nThe following example shows the data included as headers:\n\nREFER sip:b@atlanta.example.com SIP/2.0\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP agenta.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK2293940223\nTo: <sip:b@atlanta.example.com>\nFrom: <sip:a@atlanta.example.com>;tag=193402342\nCall-ID: 898234234@agenta.atlanta.example.com\nCSeq: 23 REFER\nMax-Forwards: 7\nRefer-To: sip:user@domain.com", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"}]}

When the secret reaches its expiration date, it transitions to a Destroyed state. When the transition happens, the value that is associated with the secret is no longer recoverable. The transition to the Destroyed state can take up to a couple of minutes after the secret expires, or a lock that prevented expiration is removed.\n\nFor more information about how your information is protected, see [Securing your data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-mng-data).\n* What are differences between the Reader and SecretsReader roles?\n\nBoth the Reader and SecretsReader roles help you to assign read-only access to Secrets Manager resources.\n\n\n\n* As a reader, you can browse a high-level view of secrets in your instance.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12498-9696-11699", "score": 15.356995, "text": "\n[IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials) iam_credentials* Dynamic A dynamically generated service ID and API key that can be used to access an IBM Cloud service that requires IAM authentication. \n [Key-value secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-key-value) kv Static Pieces of sensitive data that is structured in JSON format that you can use to access an application or resource. \n [SSL/TLS certificates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-certificates) imported_cert <br>public_cert* <br>private_cert* Static A type of digital certificate that can be used to establish communication privacy between a server and a client.

When it comes to managing API keys, you want the ability to create your credentials dynamically so that they exist only when you need them to. You also want to lease an API key to someone else on your team and ensure that it is automatically revoked after a time duration that you specify.\n\nWith Secrets Manager, you can create a\n\ndynamic secretthat you can use to access a protected resource, such as deployment logs that you store in a Cloud Object Storage bucket.

Later, a developer wants to access the contents of your storage bucket. The developer sends a request to retrieve the value of your IAM credential.\n4.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 19.888796, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 14.373378, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}]}

This automatic retraining is required to assure your ability to run your trained models in your next upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practices \n\nIt's recommended to use the Latest version in your production deployment of Watson Assistant for IBM Cloud Pak for Data. This is the default for newly-created assistants. During an upgrade, your settings don't automatically switch existing assistants to use the latest version. If prior to your upgrade you had selected Latest, your settings continue to use that version, now labeled as Previous. After you upgrade, it's recommended you choose Latest and run basic regression tests.\n\nIBM performs robust testing on a variety of data sets to minimize impacts on existing assistants. But given the nature of machine learning models and the nuance and subtlety of natural languages processing, you may find some discrepancies from version to version. If you find a major issue through your tests, you have the ability to switch your settings and use Previous to return to the prior behavior. In this event, we recommend you contact IBM and provide details of your test so that that IBM can support you in the steps to resolve the problem.\n\nIt's also recommended that you try the Beta version in one of your test systems after you upgrade. This gives you early visibility to changes that are likely to be delivered in a future version, and will reduce the probability of negative impacts to your production systems.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-30099-31664", "score": 17.384048, "text": "\n}\nconst token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '10000ms' });\nreturn token;\n}\n\nShow more\n3.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03422-9473-11028", "score": 17.129284, "text": "\n}\nconst token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '10000ms' });\nreturn token;\n}\nShow more\n3.

Information passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private context variable. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for a standard customer. You do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such, but you must pass this information to your action so it can change the flow of the conversation.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

Do not redact the information or replace it wholesale with variables. For best results, replace the real information with fake information of the same type.\n\nFor example, if the PII that you want to protect is client names, then instead of redacting each name or replacing each name with a variable, such as USER_NAME, replace each name with a fake name that uses a variety of typical name syntax styles, such as Jane Doe, Mr. Smith, Dietrich, or Dr. Jones, PhD. Consider writing a script that concatenates a variety of first and last names, and titles and last names, and adds last names alone to create fake names that can be inserted into the document to replace instances of real user names. The goal is to simulate as closely as possible real values in the source documents. If the same text (USER_NAME) is used in the documents or text is redacted, you will basically be training the model to expect all names to have that same value or be redacted.

Each worker node that you add in a cluster is deployed with a private IP address from the VPC subnet in that zone.

Additionally, any system that is connected to any of the private subnets in the same VPC can communicate with workers. For example, all subnets in one VPC can communicate through private layer 3 routing with a built-in VPC router. If you have multiple clusters that must communicate with each other, you can create the clusters in the same VPC.

If you need hundreds of worker nodes in a cluster, split it up into multiple clusters with fewer nodes, or order bare metal nodes. - Sorting out your services: Plan out how many services that you need for your workload before you deploy.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template.

[Templates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-termsbpb2) determine the infrastructure architecture, specifying the modules (building blocks) to deploy the cloud resources of an environment. The section [using Terraform modules with blueprint templates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-blueprint-terraform) illustrates how public modules can be combined with user developed modules to create custom solutions.\n\nWell designed templates are reusable across multiple environments, with the customizable input values maintained separately from the template as [inputs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-termsbpi1). In cookie cutter fashion, several environments can be created from the same blueprint template. Each environment has its own [blueprint configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-termsbpb3) and inputs. This separation of template from its deploy time configuration is illustrated in the figure.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash.

The list starts with the most fundamental concepts.\n\n\n\n Hardware security module \n\nA hardware security module (HSM) is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing. HSMs of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services are FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified, which is the highest level of security for cryptographic hardware. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Crypto units \n\nA crypto unit is a single unit that represents an HSM and the corresponding software stack that is dedicated to the HSM for cryptography. In Hyper Protect Crypto Services, the following types of crypto unit are available:\n\n\n\n* Operational crypto unit", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13108-7-2001", "score": 14.47674, "text": "\nAbout Key Protect \n\nIBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae is a full-service encryption solution that allows data to be secured and stored in IBM Cloud using the latest envelope encryption techniques that leverage FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified cloud-based hardware security modules.\n\nSensitive data should not be stored on any cloud provider unencrypted (as \"plaintext\", in other words). But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08462-7-2096", "score": 14.267757, "text": "\nProtecting your data with envelope encryption - Standard Plan \n\nEnvelope encryption is the practice of encrypting data with a\n\ndata encryption key (DEK)and then wrapping the DEK with aroot keythat you can fully manage.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14916-7-2291", "score": 14.742706, "text": "\nOverview \n\nUse IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud to create your own space in IBM Cloud\u00ae.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

If you have large amounts of confidential data, it is often helpful to use a Key Management System to assist in keeping your data secure. Key Protect uses the envelope encryption technique to keep your data resilient. Envelope encryption is the process of using encrypted keys, Data Encryption Keys and Root Keys, to protect your sensitive data.\n\nImagine that you plan to send a letter to a colleague.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match.

This encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Masking: \n\nData Security Broker can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration to external parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deployment Plans in IBM Cloud Data Data Security Broker: \n\nWhen you assign and customize default Data Protection Policies with Data Security Broker Manager, there are three options that you can choose to implement your data encryption policy:\n\n\n\n Save Policy: \n\nSave Policy option is selected by default. This option saves your selected data, but does not execute encryption or data protection on your database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new policy is saved to overwrite it.

Application-level encryption can be implemented by including a database proxy that intercepts and encrypts sensitive data in accordance with the pre-established data protection policy.\n\nData Security Broker encryption has some restrictions, like any other approaches to the application-level encryption implementation. The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location. Alternatively, you can secure the information with a password, but this reduces security, depending on the level of your password's strength.\n\nAccessibility If your key file is lost, your data is also lost. So, make a backup of your data and your key.\n\nDatabase operations carried out on encrypted versions of the data The information is kept in encrypted form in the database and the database engine and, consequently, the database administrator is never permitted to see the information in form of the plaintext.\n\nMany of today's server and network technologies allow for easier configuration and implementation to minimize the impact on utilization.

This technology allows end users to encrypt entirely within the instance, and can provide additional protection for sensitive data in-transit between the instances and the physical drive media. Some operating systems also provide FIPS certified encryption algorithms that may also be used. See [Encrypting block devices using LUKS](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/encrypting-block-devices-using-luks_security-hardening) for an example of how to encrypt on Red Hat Enterprise Linux\u00ae however, refer to the Operating System documentation or specific information on how to encrypt each device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Protecting your sensitive data in VPC \n\nKey Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Services provide a higher level of protection called envelope encryption.\n\n[Envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-envelope-ecryption-byok) encrypts one encryption key with another encryption key. A DEK encrypts your actual data. The DEK is never stored. Rather, it's encrypted by a key encryption key. The LUKS passphrase is then encrypted by a root key, which creates a WDEK. To decrypt data, the WDEK is unwrapped so you can access the data that's stored on the volume. This process is possible only by accessing the root key that is stored in your KMS instance. Root keys in HPCS service instances are also protected by a\n\nhardware security module (HSM)master key.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-mng-data"}]}

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

Subscription billing means that you purchase a subscription for an amount of credit to spend during the subscription term, and usage is deducted from the subscription credit at a discounted rate. Subscription credit, as well as credit from any promotions, is added to the enterprise credit pool, which is shared across all accounts in the enterprise. As accounts use resources, credit is spent from the credit pool. The Pay as you go with Committed Use billing model is similar to the billing model for Subscription accounts. You commit to spend a certain amount on IBM Cloud and receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount.\n\nZoom\n\n![A diagram that shows that credit from accounts is added to the enterprise credit pool, which is managed by the billing administrator in the enterprise account.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/d4595e5202a9a27767cf034e81b038cdf772e0d5/secure-enterprise/images/enterprise-billing.svg)\n\nFigure 2.

Service IDs are used to provide a separate identity for services and applications. Service IDs are best used when an application or service needs a digital identity and needs access to only IAM-enabled resources. You can create a service ID to be used by an application that needs access to your IBM Cloud services so that individual user credentials don't need to be used.\n\n\n\n Service ID API keys \n\nYou can also create API keys that are associated with service IDs to authenticate applications as a particular service ID. This way, the applications can access resources that are assigned to that specific service ID. Service ID API key credentials can be used to make API and CLI calls.

With trusted profiles, it is possible for a user to complete the actions without being invited to an account. Instead, they are automatically granted access to resources when they apply the trusted profile identity during login. Only users federated by an external IdP can be mapped to trusted profiles during login by evaluating SAML-based attributes to determine which profiles their identity can apply.\n\nSimilarly, instead of creating a service ID, generating an API key, and getting the application to store and validate that key, you can create [trusted profiles for compute resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile) to define fine-grained authorization for all applications that are running in a compute resource.

This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the /dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02900-4643-6783", "score": 16.650013, "text": "\n* a digression that starts elsewhere and enters the node must return to the interrupted dialog flow after the current dialog flow is completed\n\n\n\nTo change the digression behavior for an individual node, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Click the node to open its edit view.\n2. Click Customize, and then click the Digressions tab.\n\nThe configuration options differ depending on whether the node you are editing is a root node, a child node, a node with children, or a node with slots.\n\n\n\n Digressions away from this node \n\nIf the circumstances listed earlier do not apply, then you can make the following choices:\n\n\n\n* All node types: Choose whether to allow users to digress away from the current node before they reach the end of the current dialog branch.\n* All nodes that have children: Choose whether you want the conversation to come back to the current node after a digression if the current node's response has already been displayed and its child nodes are incidental to the node's goal. Set the Allow return from digressions triggered after this node's response toggle to No to prevent the dialog from returning to the current node and continuing to process its branch.\n\nFor example, if the user asks, Do you sell cupcakes? and the response, We offer cupcakes in a variety of flavors and sizes is displayed before the user changes subjects, you might not want the dialog to return to where it was. Especially, if the child nodes only address possible follow-up questions from the user and can safely be ignored.\n\nHowever, if the node relies on its child nodes to address the question, then you might want to force the conversation to return and continue processing the nodes in the current branch. For example, the initial response might be, We offer cupcakes in all shapes and sizes. Which menu do you want to see: gluten-free, dairy-free, or regular? If the user changes subjects at this point, you might want the dialog to return so the user can pick a menu type and get the information they wanted.\n* Nodes with slots: Choose whether you want to allow users to digress away from the node before all of the slots are filled.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime"}]}

The step condition would use an expression like this:\n\n${savings} - (${Step_232} + ${transfer_fee}) < 50\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n* ${savings} represents a session variable that stores the customer's savings account total.\n* ${Step_232} represents the step that asks for the amount the customer wants to transfer.\n* ${transfer_fee} represents a session variable that specifies the fee for a funds transfer.\n\n\n\nIf the step condition is met, the step warns the user that the requested transfer will bring the savings account balance below the $50 minimum and incur a fee, and ask to confirm before proceeding.\n\nTo use an expression in a step condition, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the step, click Add condition.\n\nA condition is generated automatically with the most likely choice, which is typically any variables that were set in the previous step.\n2.

For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03026-3251-4928", "score": 15.333216, "text": "\nFor example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant.

An alternative method for evaluating the relevance of a newly submitted utterance is triggered in addition to the standard method.\n\nThe supplemental method examines the structure of the new utterance and compares it to the structure of the user example utterances in your training data. This alternate approach helps skills that have few or no counterexamples recognize irrelevant utterances. It is likely to have less of an effect for skills that have a sufficient number of counterexamples defined already.\n\nNote that the new method relies on structural information that is based on data from outside your skill. So, while the new method can be useful as you are starting out, to build an assistant that provides a more customized experience, you want it to use information from data that is derived from within the application's domain.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03069-7-2188", "score": 22.795519, "text": "\nTutorial: Building a complex dialog \n\nIn this tutorial, you will use the Watson Assistant service to create a dialog for an assistant that helps users with inquiries about a fictitious restaurant called Truck Stop Gourmand.\n\n\n\n Learning objectives \n\nBy the time you finish the tutorial, you will understand how to:\n\n\n\n* Plan a dialog\n* Define custom intents\n* Add dialog nodes that can handle your intents\n* Add entities to make your responses more specific\n* Add a pattern entity, and use it in the dialog to find patterns in user input\n* Set and reference context variables\n\n\n\n\n\n Duration \n\nThis tutorial will take approximately 2 to 3 hours to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n Prerequisite \n\nBefore you begin, complete the [Getting Started tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-getting-started).\n\nYou will use the dialog skill that you created, and add nodes to the simple dialog that you built as part of the getting started exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Plan the dialog \n\nYou are building an assistant for a restaurant named Truck Stop Gourmand that has one location and a thriving cake-baking business. You want the simple assistant to answer user questions about the restaurant, its menu, and to cancel customer cake orders. Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input. The General_About_You intent that is provided with the General content catalog serves a similar function, but its user examples are designed to focus on queries about the assistant as opposed to the business that is using the assistant to help its customers. So, you will add your own intent.\n\n\n\n Add the about_restaurant intent \n\n\n\n1.

The accuracy of this vetted data, called ground truth or gold standard documents, is critical because inaccuracies in the ground truth will correlate to inaccuracies in the applications that rely on it.\n\nAn essential part of teaching Watson about a new domain involves providing it with knowledge about entities of interest in your domain content, the relationships between them, and how the entities co-reference each other. Collecting this knowledge includes the following activities:\n\n\n\n* Involving domain subject matter experts to create the following resources, or to identify existing resources that can be re-used or modified for your domain:\n\n\n\n* Annotation guidelines and examples to help human annotators learn how words and passages in your domain content are to be annotated.\n* Type systems that define the domain-specific types (objects) and features (data classifications) that can be discovered in your domain content through text analysis.

They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters.

A description of key concepts for Kubernetes\n\nAccount\n: Your account refers to your IBM Cloud account.\n\nCluster, worker pool, and worker node\n: A Kubernetes cluster consists of a master and one or more compute hosts that are called worker nodes. Worker nodes are organized into worker pools of the same flavor, or profile of CPU, memory, operating system, attached disks, and other properties. The worker nodes correspond to the Kubernetes Node resource, and are managed by a Kubernetes master that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster.

With the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

ZIP files that are created by right-clicking a folder and clicking Compress are not supported.\n* PDF files that you upload as part of an archive file are not displayed in the advanced view for a query result that you open from the Improve and customize page. If you want the file to be viewable from the advanced view, reimport the PDF file separately from the archive file.\n\n\n\nWhen you add files to a Document Retrieval for Contracts project type, any file types that support SDU and OCR are processed with a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model and Optical Character Recognition automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n Document limits \n\nThe number of documents that are allowed per service instance depends on your Discovery plan type.\n\nThe document limit applies to the number of documents in the index. Upload fewer documents at the start if the enrichments that you plan to apply might increase the number of documents later. For example, the following configurations generate more documents:\n\n\n\n* Splitting documents segments one document into multiple documents\n* CSV files that you upload generate one document per line\n* Database data sources that you crawl produce one document per database row", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collections"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16358-3407-5152", "score": 13.925409, "text": "\nSplitting the PDF creates two smaller files that can be enriched faster in Discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create a Document Retrieval project \n\nNow that you have the latest copy of the product documentation, add it to a Discovery project as your data source.\n\nIn Discovery, you will create a Document Retrieval project type.

Typically, text can't be extracted from embedded fonts that don't map to unicode characters.

If you do not see the same characters that are visible in the PDF itself, then the text extraction would likely fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n Formatted documents \n\nWhen formatted documents are converted to plain text, it's possible that losing the formatting could result in poor tokenization of words. For example, if a table row in a DOCX file contains cell values that do not end with a period, the values might be converted as one sentence. As another example, if a PDF document contains a very long word that is hyphenated at the end of a line, that word might be converted as two words.

From this tutorial, you learn how to create a basic website that interfaces with your IBM Cloud database to read and write data.\n\nThe project is a simple to-do list, where you can see a list of notes. You can add and delete notes. Each of your notes has a tag, and you can filter your notes by tag.\n2. To create this to-do list, your application needs to be able to read and write to the database. To read to-dos in \"newest first\" order and to filter by tag, your database needs to have some secondary indexes. Now, we can create all of that.\n\n\n\nYou can complete the tutorial in less than an hour. It doesn't cost you anything over your current IBM Cloudant bill (so it's free if you are on the IBM Cloudant Lite plan).\n\nThe website that you create is served from your local machine, so no other services are required apart from IBM Cloud.\n\nAfter you complete it, you have a basic understanding of how applications can interface with IBM Cloudant through an IBM Cloudant SDK (in this case, NodeJS).\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nYou need the following implements to complete this tutorial:\n\n\n\n1.

Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size.

All of IBM Cloudant's functions are included, but Lite plan instances have a fixed amount of provisioned throughput capacity and data storage. The provisioned throughput capacity is fixed at 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second, and data storage is capped at 1 GB.\n\nStorage usage is checked daily. If you exceed your 1-GB storage limit, requests to the IBM Cloudant instance receive a 402 status code with the following error message, Account exceeded its data usage quota. An upgrade to a paid plan is required. A banner also appears on the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. You can still read and delete data. However, to write new data, you have two options. First, you can upgrade to a paid [Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan), which removes the write limitation immediately. Alternatively, you can delete data so that your total storage falls under the 1-GB limit and wait until the next daily storage check runs for your instance to allow writes again.\n\nIf you want to store more than one GB of data, or be able to scale provisioned throughput capacity, move to the [Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan).\n\nYou're limited to one IBM Cloudant Lite plan instance per IBM Cloud account.

Event Streams data can be replicated between an Event Streams instance in one location (region) and another instance in a different location. However, the user is responsible for provisioning a remote Event Streams instance and managing the replication.\n\nWe suggest a tool like Kafka MirrorMaker to replicate data between clusters. For information about how to run MirrorMaker, see [Event Streams kafka-mirrormaker repository](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-samples/tree/master/kafka-mirrormaker).\n\nThe user is also responsible for the backup of message payload data. Although this data is replicated across multiple Kafka brokers within a cluster, which protects against the majority of failures, this replication does not cover a location-wide failure.\n\nTopic names are backed up by Event Streams, although it is recommended good practice for users to back up topic names and the configuration data for those topics.\n\nIf you have configured your Event Streams instance in a Multi-Zone Region, a regional disaster is very unlikely. However, we recommend that users do plan for such circumstances. If a user's instance is no longer available because of a disaster (and a remote DR instance is not already set up), the user should consider configuring a new instance in a new region and restoring their topics and data from backup if available.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02660-1509-3609", "score": 16.07549, "text": "\nCurrently, Dallas (us-south), Washington DC (us-east), London (eu-gb), and Sydney (au-syd) regions are supported.\n4.

To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-1659-3917", "score": 24.168016, "text": "\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill.

You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03353-5263-7331", "score": 18.59445, "text": "\nItalian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English. All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing a skill language \n\nOnce a skill has been created, its language cannot be modified. If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1. From your skill tile, click the Actions drop-down menu, and then select Language Preferences.\n\nThis option is only available for skills that are configured to use a bidirectional language.\n2. Select from the following options for your skill:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 18.347273, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

It then learns from training data written in the target language that you add to it.\n\nThe universal model is available as a beta feature.

Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1. From your skill tile, click the Actions drop-down menu, and then select Language Preferences.\n\nThis option is only available for skills that are configured to use a bidirectional language.\n2.

The user examples should be tailored to your specific business.

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions. This is typically defined as a DR architecture.\n\nThe benefits of using a [DR orchestrator](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-cloud-resiliency-orchestrator) are covered in the context of a cloud environment and its fast changing behavior. You might require several integrations with management tools and services in IBM Cloud\u00ae. Examples throughout these best practices are provided to demonstrate the native capabilities and documentation currently available to implement DR for IBM Cloud services and suggest additional services that are often required to implement an enterprise-level resiliency solution.\n\nThe best practices in this section are based on the services and features currently available and might change over time. We recommend that you verify possible changes or additional features that might apply to your environment.\n\n\n\n General disaster recovery strategy \n\nThe approach to defining your DR strategy needs to be systematic and start with the application or service, which is defined as a set of compute resources, for example Kubernetes apps, virtual machines, services, and more, that make up a business application.\n\nWhile a holistic approach might be wanted, the reality is that each business application (cloud service) is independent, with its own", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-dr"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08669-6042-7847", "score": 16.464624, "text": "\nDisaster recovery includes tasks such as providing dependencies on disaster recovery sites, provision disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events.

IBM will also make additional crypto units available in a different region and manage routing requests to the new crypto units. When a regional disaster that affects all available zones occurs, load your master key to the new crypto units that IBM provisions in a different region for restoring data. You can also enable and initialize failover crypto units before a disaster occurs, which reduces the downtime. \n Availability Provide high availability capabilities, such as IBM-owned infrastructure in multizone regions, to meet local access and low latency requirements for each supported region.

Include implementation of backups as part of deployable architectures. Keep backup configuration close to provisioning code so that it is easier to ensure that backups are adjusted as information system changes occur. Create and configure backup accounts as code.\n\n\n\n\n\n Backup accounts \n\nEach BU account group should include a separate backup account and an additional backup account should be used for the centralized accounts. These backup accounts provide an extra layer of protection for the confidentiality and integrity of the backed up data. If credentials to a source account are compromised, it should not be possible to use that access to tamper with backups.\n\nSupporting this effort, authorization to backup data in the backup account should use service-to-service or service to trusted profile authorization where possible. Otherwise, use secure storage of credentials with least privilege access.\n\nIf you are using Cloud Object Storage for backup, at minimum, use separate buckets for backing up different workload accounts. Also, use separate backup credentials for each bucket where service to service policies are not possible. Use Cloud Object Storage versioning or [immutable buckets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutable) for maximum security.\n\nServices that provide built in backup facilities might have limitations regarding backup accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n Service-specific considerations \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Databases \n\n[IBM Cloud Databases](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-about) provide automatic daily backups that are stored in the same account and geography.

For the sake of simplicity, we can group the different options in three major categories:\n\nActive/Passive\n: Active/Passive options are based on keeping the full application stack active in one location, while another application stack is deployed in a different location but kept idle or shut down. In the case of prolonged unavailability of the primary site, the application stack is activated in the backup site. Often that requires the restoring of backups that are taken in the primary site. This approach is not recommended when losing data can be a problem, for example when the RPO is less than a few hours or when the availability of the service is critical and the RTO objective is less than a few hours.\n\nActive/Standby\n: In the Active/Standby case, the full application stack is active in both the primary and backup location.

To minimize the downtime of the service and impact to your business, you could implement a manual failover to switch to another region while the region is being restored.

Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring.

The initial volume and network bandwidth allocation depends on the [instance profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles) and the bandwidth ratio that you selected for your instance.\n\nThe allocation of the instance's total bandwidth can be adjusted, balancing between network bandwidth and volume bandwidth. If you do not specify the initial volume and network bandwidth allocation, then 25% of total instance bandwidth is allocated to volume bandwidth and 75% is allocated to network bandwidth.\n\nThe maximum volume bandwidth is the highest potential bandwidth that can be allocated to the volume when it is attached to an instance. In cases where the total maximum bandwidth of attached volumes exceeds the amount that is available on the instance, the bandwidth for each volume attachment is set proportionally. The bandwidth is allocated based on the corresponding volume's maximum bandwidth.\n\nThe volume bandwidth available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes.\n\nFor more information, see [Bandwidth allocation for instance profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bandwidth-allocation-profiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n How block size affects performance \n\nIOPS value is based on a 16 KB block size (for all the tiers) with a 50-50 read/write random workload. Each 16 KB of data read/written counts as one read/write operation; a single write of less than 16 KB counts as a single write operation.\n\nBaseline throughput is determined by the number of IOPS multiplied by the throughput multiplier. The throughput multiplier is 16 KB for 3 IOPS/GB or 5 IOPS/GB tiers, or 256 KB for 10 IOPS/GB or custom IOPS tiers. The higher the IOPS that you specify, the higher the throughput. Maximum throughput is 1024 MBps.\n\nThe application I/O size directly impacts storage performance. If the application I/O size is smaller than the throughput multiplier that is used by the profile to calculate the volume\u2019s bandwidth limit, the IOPS limit is reached before the throughput limit.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-capacity-performance&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15092-1771-3753", "score": 20.415028, "text": "\nThe bandwidth for each attached volume is set proportionally based on the [volume size and profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles).\n\nFor optimal bandwidth to be realized, detach and reattach the volume after volume bandwidth allocation in the UI, CLI, or API.\n\n\n\n Adjusting volume bandwidth \n\nYou can change the volume/networking bandwidth ratio to meet your needs, but both volume and network bandwidth must be at least 500 Mbps each. For example, to allow more bandwidth for volumes, you can apportion the previous example in equal allocations:\n\n\n\n* Volumes: 2,000 Mbps.\n* Network: 2,000 Mbps.\n\n\n\nHowever, before you change the volume/networking bandwidth ratio, be sure to evaluate your instance's network bandwidth requirements. Make sure that the new bandwidth allocation does not have negative effects on your instance\u2019s network performance.\n\nExtending the example for multiple volumes, the bandwidth looks like this:\n\n\n\n* Total allocation for volumes is 2,000 Mbps,\n* Less boot volume minimum allocation, 393 Mbps,\n* Remaining bandwidth for data volumes: 1,607 Mbps.\n\n\n\nThe volume bandwidth that is available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes. For example, if you have an instance with four identical attached volumes but you are using only one volume, then that volume can get only the bandwidth that is assigned to it.

Review the list of supported [Natural Language Understanding service entity types and subtypes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-entity-types) to determine if there is a natural overlap between them and the types in your type system. If so, continue with this procedure. If not, choose a different pre-annotator to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nNatural Language Understanding is a service that offers text analysis through natural language processing. When you use the Natural Language Understanding pre-annotator, it calls the Natural Language Understanding service to find and annotate entities in your documents.\n\nYou must specify the entity types that you want the service to look for by mapping the Natural Language Understanding entity types to corresponding Knowledge Studio entity types that you have added to the Knowledge Studio type system. Only mentions of entity types that you map will be found and annotated.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo use the Natural Language Understanding service to pre-annotate documents, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Log in as a Knowledge Studio administrator and select your workspace.\n2. Go to the Machine Learning Model > Pre-annotation page.\n3. Click the overflow menu button in the Natural Language Understanding row, and then click Map entity types.\n\n\n\n* The drop-down list of the Natural Language Understanding entity types is pre-populated with entity types that are recognized by the Natural Language Understanding service.\n* You must map at least one entity type.\n* You cannot map an Natural Language Understanding entity type to a Knowledge Studio entity role, only Knowledge Studio entity types.\n* You can map more than one Natural Language Understanding entity type to a single Knowledge Studio entity type, or the other way around.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-preannotation"}]}

Notice that you will have to check periodically for vulnerability fixes, patches, and minor version releases to keep the agent free of issues.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-log_analysis_agent"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05527-49848-50451", "score": 15.62661, "text": "\nWorker node patch updates can be applied by updating, reloading (in classic infrastructure), or replacing (in VPC infrastructure) the worker node.\n\n\n\nChanges since version 1.16.8_1528\n\n Component Previous Current Description \n\n containerd v1.3.3 v1.3.4 See the [containerd release notes](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.3.4). \n HA proxy 1.8.25-30b675 1.8.25-adb65d The update addresses [CVE-2020-1967](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1967). \n Kubernetes v1.16.8 v1.16.9 See the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.16.9).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-116_changelog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05528-84256-84859", "score": 15.606863, "text": "\nWorker node patch updates can be applied by updating, reloading (in classic infrastructure), or replacing (in VPC infrastructure) the worker node.\n\n\n\nChanges since version 1.17.4_1521\n\n Component Previous Current Description \n\n containerd v1.3.3 v1.3.4 See the [containerd release notes](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.3.4). \n HA proxy 1.8.25-30b675 1.8.25-adb65d The update addresses [CVE-2020-1967](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1967). \n Kubernetes v1.17.4 v1.17.5 See the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.17.5).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-117_changelog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05600-58848-60266", "score": 14.928696, "text": "\nWorker node patch updates can be applied by updating, reloading (in classic infrastructure), or replacing (in VPC infrastructure) the worker node.\n\n\n\nChanges since version 1.21.5_1532\n\n Component Previous Current Description \n\n Containerd v1.5.5 v1.5.7 See the [security bulletin](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6501867) and the [change log](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.7). \n Ubuntu 18.04 packages 4.15.0-158 4.15.0-159 Updated worker node images and kernel with package updates [CVE-2021-3778](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3778) and [CVE-2021-3796](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3796). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Change log for master fix pack 1.21.5_1531, released 28 September 2021 \n\nThe following table shows the changes that are in the master fix pack patch update 1.21.5_1531.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15745-3108-5252", "score": 14.072099, "text": "\nRoute mode for VNFs Yes (see [Setting up high availability for Virtual Network Functions (VNF)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf)) No \n Virtual Servers on VPC Yes Yes \n Member type Virtual server instances Virtual server instances, Bare Metal, Power Systems Virtual Server \n Power Systems Virtual Server instances connected over Direct Link No Yes (No support for instance groups) \n\n\n\n\n\n High Availability mode \n\nThe application load balancer is configured in active-active mode. All compute resources of the load balancer are actively involved in forwarding traffic.\n\nHigh Availability (HA) is achieved by using a Domain Name Service (DNS). The Virtual IP (VIP) of each compute resource is registered to the assigned DNS. If any of the compute resources go down, the other resources continue to forward traffic.\n\nAn NLB is configured in active-standby mode. A single VIP is registered with DNS, and traffic is forwarded through that compute resource. If an active compute resource goes down, the standby takes over and the VIP is transferred to the standby.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-zone support \n\nNetwork load balancers can accept members across all three availability zones, but the NLB itself resides in one specific zone. A zone is identified by the subnet that is selected when a load balancer is created. Cloud Internet Services (CIS) Global Load Balancer or Private DNS can be used with multiple zonal network load balancers for multi-zone availability.\n\nThe application load balancer can also be configured to span multiple zones. The back-end servers can be in any zone within a region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration with private catalogs \n\nIBM Cloud Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer both integrate with private catalogs to centrally manage access to products in the IBM Cloud catalog and your own catalogs. You can customize your private catalogs to allow or disallow load balancer provisioning to specific users in your account.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16295-7-1721", "score": 20.551758, "text": "\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "score": 23.031612, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations.

A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"></div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16326-3092-4450", "score": 15.658699, "text": "\nYou can visualize how your assistant would look as a web chat widget on your organization's website.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-14167-16117", "score": 15.613037, "text": "\n{location}.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud: Hosts the web chat server, which handles communication with your assistant.

For more information, see [Finding and updating the endpoint URL](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson?topic=watson-endpoint-changeendpoint-find-update).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reviewing security \n\nThe web chat integration undergoes tests and scans on a regular basis to find and address potential security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nBe sure to run your own security reviews to see how the web chat fits in with your current website structure and policies. The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs. For information about how to avoid this problem, see [Managing user identity information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-userid).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 15.317984, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

Or if you offer an online support request form, you might add Open a support ticket.\n\nWhether you use the default option label or add your own, make sure your dialog is designed to recognize the message and respond to it appropriately. For more information, see [Connecting customers with support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-support).\n\n\n\nWith web chat version 2.4 only, you cannot enable suggestions unless your web chat is connected to [a service desk solution](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-haa). Later releases allow you to enable suggestions whether or not you have human agent support configured.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog considerations \n\nThe rich responses that you add to a dialog are displayed in the web chat as expected, with the following exceptions:\n\n\n\n* Connect to human agent: If service desk support is enabled for the web chat, this response type triggers a chat transfer. If service desk support is not configured, this response type is ignored.\n* Option: If your option list contains up to four choices, they are displayed as buttons. If your list contains five or more options, then they are displayed in a drop-down list.\n* Pause: This response type pauses the assistant's activity in the chat. However, activity does not resume after the pause until another response is triggered. Whenever you include a pause response type, add another, different response type, such as text, after it.\n\n\n\nFor more information about rich response types, see [Rich responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multimedia).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-33522-35244", "score": 14.895764, "text": "\nIn the web chat, the linked video will render using the embeddable player for the hosting service.\n\nSpecify the URL you would use to view the video in your browser (for example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52bpMKVigGU).

(For more information about dialog responses, see [Responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-responses)).\n\n\n\n Response output format \n\nBy default, responses from a dialog node are specified in the output.generic object in the response JSON returned from the /message API. The generic object contains an array of up to 5 response elements that are intended for any channel. The following JSON example shows a response that includes text and an image:\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"text\",\n\"text\": \"OK, here's a picture of a dog.\"\n},\n{\n\"response_type\": \"image\",\n\"source\": \"http://example.com/dog.jpg\"\n}\n],\n\"text\" : [\"OK, here's a picture of a dog.\"]\n},\n\"user_id\": \"faf4a112-f09f-4a95-a0be-43c496e6ac9a\"\n}\nShow more\n\nAs this example shows, the text response (OK, here's a picture of a dog.) is also returned in the output.text array. This is included for backward compatibility for older applications that do not support the output.generic format.\n\nIt is the reponsibility of your client application to handle all response types appropriately. In this case, your application would need to display the specified text and image to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n Response types", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02899-7-1688", "score": 28.661787, "text": "\nDefining responses using the JSON editor \n\nIn some situations, you might need to define responses using the JSON editor. (For more information about dialog responses, see [Responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-responses)). Editing the response JSON gives you direct access to the data that will be returned to the communication channel or custom application.\n\n\n\n Generic JSON format \n\nThe generic JSON format for responses is used to specify responses that are intended for any messaging channel. This format can be implemented by a custom client application. (This is the format that is used by default for dialog responses defined using the Watson Assistant user interface.)\n\nFor information about how to open the JSON editor for a dialog node response from the tool, see [Context variables in the JSON editor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-var-json).\n\nTo specify an interactive response in the generic JSON format, insert the appropriate JSON objects into the output.generic field of the dialog node response.

The channels property of the generic response object provides a way to do this.\n\nThis mechanism is useful if your conversation flow does not change based on the integration in use, and if you cannot know in advance what integration the response is sent to at run time. By using channels, you can define a single step that supports all integrations, while still customizing the output for each channel. For example, you might want to customize the text formatting, or even send different response types, based on what the channel supports.\n\nUsing channels is useful along with the channel_transfer response type. Because the message output is processed both by the channel that initiates the transfer and by the target channel, you can use channels to define responses that are processed by one or the other. (For more information, and an example, see [Channel transfer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-assistant-responses-jsonassistant-responses-json-channel-transfer).)\n\nTo specify the integrations for which a response is intended, include the optional channels array as part of the response object. All response types support the channels array. This array contains one or more objects by using the following syntax:\n\n{\n\"channel\": \"<channel_name>\"\n}\n\nThe value of <channel_name> can be any of the following strings:\n\n\n\n* chat: Web chat\n* voice_telephony: Phone\n* text_messaging: SMS\n* slack: Slack\n* facebook: Facebook Messenger\n* whatsapp: WhatsApp\n\n\n\nThe following example shows step output that contains two responses: one intended for the web chat integration and one intended for the Slack and Facebook integrations.\n\n{\n\"generic\": [\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-assistant-responses-json"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16266-7110-9243", "score": 27.463793, "text": "\nimage\n: Displays an image that is specified by a URL.\n\noption\n: Presents a set of options (such as buttons or a drop-down list) that users can choose from.

The home screen displays a greeting and an optional set of suggested conversation starters for common questions and problems. The customer can either click a conversation starter or type a message in the input field to start the conversation with the assistant.\n\n![web chat example home screen](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/web-chat-home-screen-lendyr.png)\n\nThe appearance and behavior of the launcher icon, the home screen, and most other aspects of the web chat can be configured and customized to match your website style and branding.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16368-7-2072", "score": 19.157534, "text": "\nWeb chat development overview \n\nIf you are comfortable with JavaScript code, you can customize and extend the web chat by using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView to embed the web chat in your mobile app.\n\nFor detailed reference information about the web chat API, see the web chat [developer documentation](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=).\n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website or a WebView in your mobile app, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source (for more information about the embed script, see [Embedding the web chat on your page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-web-chat)). Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 19.120787, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

For example, you can embed the assistant in your company website or add it to a messaging platform such as Facebook, Slack, or WhatsApp.\n\nWhile the conversational skill is defined in text, customers can talk with your assistant over the phone when you deploy it by using the phone integration.\n\nFor more information about ways to deploy the assistant, see [Adding integrations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add).\n\nUnderstanding where you will deploy the assistant before you begin can help you author the right types of answers for a given channel or platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n What languages does your assistant speak? \n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language. For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13074-16820-18514", "score": 16.48324, "text": "\nEmotion Analysis can detect emotions that are associated with targeted phrases, entities, or keywords, or it can analyze the overall emotional tone of your content.\n\nExample portion of a document enriched with Emotion Analysis:\n\n{\n\"text\": \"The stockholders were pleased that Acme Corporation plans to build a new factory in Atlanta, Georgia.\",\n\"enriched_text\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"document\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"disgust\": 0.102578,\n\"joy\": 0.626655,\n\"anger\": 0.02303,\n\"fear\": 0.018884,\n\"sadness\": 0.096802\n}\n}\n}\n\nIn the preceding example, you could query the joy Emotion by accessing enriched_text.emotion.document.emotion.joy\n\nEmotion Analysis analyzes your text and calculates a score for each emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness) on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it.

Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity might implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word \"barri\u00f3\", which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb \"barrer\" (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word \"barrio\" (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" vs. \"una\". In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-16079-18117", "score": 14.523524, "text": "\n: The dialog feature is available in the new Watson Assistant experience.

For example, you can now expect the same confidence score for the following two inputs: ik ben een kleine krijger? and ik ben een kleine krijger. In this example, the question mark (?) doesn't affect the confidence score.\n\nImproved enhanced intent detection\n: The exact match in enhanced intent detection now better handles small differences between training examples and runtime utterances when the differences do not change the meaning of a sentence.\n\nFor example, suppose in your training examples, covid-19 is in the covid intent and @doctortype_facilitytype around Palm Beach is in the find_provide_master intent. In this example, the @doctortype_facilitytype direct entity reference contains entity values, including hospital. At run time, covid19 is predicted as 100% confident for the covid intent, and hospital around palm beach is predicted as 100% confident for the find_provide_master intent.\n\nThis update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model.
