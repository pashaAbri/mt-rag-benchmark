For example: website_failedRequest |region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'.\n\nThe same metric name can produce multiple time-series when the metric and label values differ.\n\nFor example, the following are 4 unique time series:\n\nmetric_name{datacenter=\u201ddc-1\u201d, zone=\u201dzone1\u201d} 23\nmetric_name{datacenter=\u201ddc-2\u201d, zone=\u201dzone1\u201d} 34\nmetric_name{datacenter=\u201ddc-3\u201d, zone=\u201dzone2\u201d} 43\nmetric_name{datacenter=\u201ddc-4\u201d, zone=\u201dzone2\u201d} 23\n\nA data-point is the value generated for a time-series at a given point in time. For example: [timestamp]|website_failedRequests:20|region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'.\n\nFor example, 3K unique time-series in 10 seconds is 18K data-points per minute. Or, 3K unique time-series in a minute would be 3K data-points per minute.\n\nYou are billed based on the number of time series hours collected during a billing cycle.\n\n\n\n Sources of time-series \n\nFor TIME_SERIES_HOURS, there are 4 sources of custom metrics:\n\n\n\n* Custom metrics created by agents such as Prometheus, StatsD, JMX, and AppChecks.\n\n\n\n* Prometheus metrics are collected from Prometheus endpoints.

Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds. The level of precision is not restricted, so you can specify values such as 0.25 and 0.125. The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request. The service calculates and returns metrics in real-time at the requested interval.\n* With the asynchronous HTTP interface, you specify query parameters with a speech recognition request. The service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events. If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number. If the interval is larger than the duration of the audio, the service returns processing metrics only for transcription events.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding processing metrics", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics"}]}

Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.\n* Am I charged for all audio that I send, even audio that does not include speech?\n\nYes, all audio that you send to the service contributes to your cumulative minutes of audio. This includes silence and noisy audio that does not contain or otherwise contribute to speech recognition.

Search logs \n\nWhen you search log data, the search applies any log filters and time queries configured in that view.\n\nYou can do simple searches (single term string search), compound search (multiple search terms and operators), field searches if the log line can be parsed, and others.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1.

Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When you place an object in the bucket, a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the time of the object write.\n\nIf your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and Retain Until Date, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.\n\nLike all other Object Lock settings, the Retain Until Date applies to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.\n\nImagine an object that is 60 days into a 90-day retention period, and you overwrite that object with the same name and a two year retention period.

Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When you place an object in the bucket, a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the time of the object write.\n\nIf your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and Retain Until Date, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.\n\nLike all other Object Lock settings, the Retain Until Date applies to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.\n\nImagine an object that is 60 days into a 90-day retention period, and you overwrite that object with the same name and a two year retention period.

Instance storage is close to the compute resources of the virtual server and on a high-speed communication channel independent from the network. An instance storage disk provides fast, affordable, temporary storage to improve the performance of cloud native workloads with scratch space, caching buffers, or a place for replicated data. The data that is stored on instance storage is ephemeral, which means that the data is tied directly to the instance lifecycle. The instance storage disk is automatically created and destroyed with the instance. Instance storage data is not lost when an instance is only rebooted.\n\nInstance storage is a complementary storage technology to the boot and block storage volumes for data offered with VPC. Some examples of use cases for instance storage disks are:\n\n\n\n* Distributed File Systems: Technologies such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which do triplication of the data across multiple servers. These technologies can improve read bandwidth and retain reliability by maintaining multiple copies of the data. It is recommended that at least three copies of the data, ideally across availability zones, are maintained when using Instance Storage for these workloads.\n* Transactional jobs: Transaction processing usually creates a significant amount of temporary files. Instance Storage is a great place to temporarily store that data while the transactions are processed, with the result stored persistently on a data volume.\n* Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Improve performance for large geographically distributed applications with instance storage for fast, low cost, local data caching.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lifecycle of instance storage \n\nThe lifecycle of instance storage is critical to understand. Without a proper understanding of its temporary nature, workloads could experience data loss.\n\nThe instance storage space is allocated and attached to the virtual server instance at the time of provisioning. It is an integral and inseparable element of the virtual server instance. If you reboot your instance (either from its operating system or through an IBM Cloud Management interface), the instance storage data is retained and the instance is reconnected to its original disks.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-instance-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14378-13964-14975", "score": 0.6892308592796326, "text": "\nYou can allocate and mount more file shares across all hosts for your workloads at the time of purchase or later within the console.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14070-7-2372", "score": 0.6821171641349792, "text": "\nStorage options \n\nYou have the option of local storage or SAN (portable SAN) for each virtual server.

Local storage provides improved disk read and write performance. The disks are built in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) configuration for redundancy, disk replacement, and health monitoring that is fully managed by IBM Cloud\u00ae. In newer data centers, this storage is all solid-state drive (SSD) to provide the best performance.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\nAll Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by Hyper Protect Crypto Services.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05166-7-1684", "score": 0.7303215265274048, "text": "\nRelease notes for Object Storage \n\nNews on the latest releases from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage provide the updates you need on all things related to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n 14 June 2023 \n\nNew location!\n: Buckets can now be created in a Regional (MZR) configuration in Madrid, Spain.

These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Pricing is based on the aggregate number of minutes of audio that you recognize per month:\n\n\n\n* Users who recognize 1 to 999,999 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.02 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n* Users who recognize at least 1,000,000 minutes of audio in a given month pay $0.01 (USD) per minute of audio for that month.\n\n\n\nThe Plus plan is intended for small businesses. It is also a good choice for large enterprises that want to develop and test larger applications before considering moving to a Premium plan. For more information, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I continue to use the Speech to Text Standard plan? \n\nThe Standard plan is no longer available for purchase by new users. But existing users of the Standard plan can continue to use the plan indefinitely with no change in their pricing. Their API settings and custom models remain unaffected.\n\nExisting users can also choose to upgrade to the new Plus plan by visiting the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text). They will continue to have access to all of their settings and custom models after upgrading. And, if they find that the Plus plan does not meet their needs for any reason, they can always downgrade back to their Standard plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n What pricing plan do I need to use the service's customization interface? \n\nYou must have a paid plan (Plus, Standard, or Premium) to use language model or acoustic model customization. Users of the Lite plan cannot use customization. To use customization, users of the Lite plan must upgrade to a paid plan such as the Plus plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13336-3083-5168", "score": 0.6568374633789062, "text": "\nAnd, if they find that the Plus plan does not meet their needs for any reason, they can always downgrade back to their Standard plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n What pricing plan do I need to use the service's customization interface? \n\nYou must have a paid plan (Plus, Standard, or Premium) to use language model or acoustic model customization.

To use customization, users of the Lite plan must upgrade to a paid plan such as the Plus plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan? \n\nYou can upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan, for example, to gain access to customization. To upgrade from the Lite plan to the Plus plan, use the Upgrade button in the resource catalog page for your service instance:\n\n\n\n* From the [resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources), click on your Speech to Text instance to go to the Speech to Text dashboard page.\n* From the Manage page, click Upgrade to move to the Plus plan.\n* Follow the steps on the Plan page to complete your upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What does \"pricing per minute\" mean? \n\nFor the Plus plan, pricing is based on the cumulative amount (number of minutes) of audio that you send to the service in any one month. The per-minute price of all audio that you recognize in a month is reduced once you reach the threshold of one million minutes of audio for that month. The price does not depend on how long the service takes to process the audio. (Per-minute pricing is different for the Standard plan.)\n\nFor information about pricing for the Plus and Standard plans, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Do you round up to the nearest minute for every call to the API? \n\nIBM does not round up the length of the audio for every API call that the service receives. Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-faq-pricing"}]}

Even if your usage varies from month to month, you get predictable, consistent billing. If your usage exceeds your total subscription amount, you're charged the non-discounted rate for the overage. For more information about tracking your subscription usage, see [Managing subscriptions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).\n\nYour subscription applies to most services in the catalog.

This tutorial is provided as an example of the steps you can follow to set up an enterprise by department, but you should carefully plan your enterprise structure around your organization's needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Create the enterprise \n\nEnterprises are created from an existing Subscription account. When you create the enterprise, the account is added to the enterprise hierarchy. Billing transitions to being managed by the enterprise, but its users and resources remain the same and are completely unaffected. For a complete description of account impacts, see [Creating an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-create-enterprise).\n\n\n\n1. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Enterprise, and click Create.\n2. Enter the name of your company, such as Example Corp, to identify your enterprise.\n3. Enter your company's domain, such as examplecorp.com.\n4. Review the information about the impact to your account, and select I understand the impact to my account. Then, click Create. The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize). The second and third tier of the Example Corp. enterprise hierarchy contain the Marketing, Development, Sales, Design, and Engineering account groups.

Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.\n\nWhen compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:\n\n\n\n* Centralized account management: View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view. Your subscription credit is pooled and shared among accounts in the enterprise.\n* Top-down usage reporting: From your enterprise account, you can view usage of all accounts in your enterprise, which is organized by account group.\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch and learn \n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nYour IBM Cloud account is your home for collaboration in the cloud. As you scale up your workloads, you might find that you're managing multiple IBM Cloud accounts. For example, your company might have many teams, each with one or more of their own accounts for development, testing, and production environments. Or, you might isolate certain workloads in separate accounts to meet security or compliance guidelines. As the number of accounts grows, it can become more difficult to track resource usage and associated costs.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises offer a simpler way to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you can create a multi-tiered hierarchy of accounts by adding new or existing accounts and nesting them in account groups. How you structure your enterprise is up to you. For example, for a large organization, you might organize your accounts by geography, or by department. You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11893-4785-6227", "score": 0.6096504926681519, "text": "\n* [Understanding responsibilities for your enterprise and your clients](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelresponsibilities-tenancy)\n* [Setting up your account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelaccount-setup-tenancy)\n\n\n\n* [Creating an enterprise account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelcreate-enterprise-tenancy)\n* [Setting up client accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelcreate-account-tenancy)\n\n\n\n* [Setting up the client location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelsetting-up-locations-tenancy)\n\n\n\n* [Sizing and creating the client location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelcreate-provision-tenancy)\n* [Attaching hosts to the location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelattach-hosts-tenancy)\n* [Assigning hosts to the control plane](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelassign-hosts-tenancy)\n\n\n\n* [Creating a cluster, API key, and cluster roles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelcreate-cluster-key-tenancy)\n\n\n\n* [Creating a Satellite cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelcreate-cluster-tenancy)\n* [Creating an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-tenancy-modelcreate-api-tenancy)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-sitemap&interface=cli"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10906-5101-6829", "score": 0.6071621775627136, "text": "\nConsider the following when determining whether you need an enterprise or a stand-alone account:<br><br><br><br> * In an enterprise, subscription discounts and cloud credits are available to all accounts that are in the enterprise.<br> * Stand-alone accounts control their own billing.

This means the users who are invited to the enterprise and the users who are invited to the accounts within the enterprise remain entirely separate. This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources.

You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accountsliteaccount).\n* How many apps can I build?\n\nThere's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.\n\nIf you created a Lite account before 12 August 2021, you can build and deploy apps with 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.\n* What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?\n\nReaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.\n\nYou can check your usage by going to Manage > Billing and usage in the IBM Cloud console, and selecting Usage. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage).\n* How many resource groups, orgs, or spaces can I create?\n\nIf you have a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, there's no limit to the number of resource groups, orgs, or spaces that you can create.

For example, a query for banana is converted to plantain OR fruit and does not contain the original term, banana. If you want an input term to be included in the query, then repeat the input term in the expanded terms list.\n\nUnidirectional example:\n\n{\n\"expansions\": [\n{\n\"input_terms\":\n\"banana\"\n],\n\"expanded_terms\":", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-search-settings"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07045-7-2118", "score": 0.6643781661987305, "text": "\nImproving your query results \n\nLearn about actions you can take to improve the quality of your query results.\n\nYou can use the tools that are built in to Discovery to make improvements.\n\n\n\n Results include more than exact matches \n\nUnlike some other search applications, adding quotation marks to a phrase that you submit does not return only exact matches. Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

However, if you specify the option MULTILINE, Data Engine can process JSON input data even if individual data records span multiple lines, such as when the data was formatted to make it easier to read. Specify this option only if you really need it because it limits input parallelization and can significantly reduce performance when you process large volumes of JSON data. If you need to frequently query large amounts of multiline JSON data, use Data Engine to transform the data into single -line JSON, or into a more performance optimized format, such as Parquet, before querying the transformed data.\n\nIf the file format is Parquet, with the optional MERGE SCHEMA clause you can handle Parquet schema evolution by specifying to scan all qualifying Parquet objects for their schema, and to merge the final schema across all objects. By default, for Parquet input only the first Parquet object that is found is used to infer the schema, which guarantees minimal overhead for compiling the SQL. Thus, use this option if your Parquet input data does not have a homogeneous schema.\n\nIf the object type identifier TEXT is used, the input is read line by line without inferring any schema.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02522-4046-5373", "score": 0.7867118120193481, "text": "\nOnce you have Data Engine running on IBM Cloud, you can immediately start querying your data by using the Data Engine UI, or programmatically by using either [the Data Engine REST API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/sql-query), or the Python ibmcloudsql library.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

Use IBM Watson Studio to run queries with Data Engine and visualize the query results with one of the various widget libraries available in [Watson Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/data-science-experience).\n\n\n\n\n\n Cloud functions \n\nData Engine is a serverless mechanism to submit SQL queries, making it a natural match for the serverless [IBM Cloud Functions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions). You can use the generic [SQL Cloud function](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmfunctions/sqlquery) to run Data Engine as an IBM Cloud function.\n\n\n\n\n\n Geospatial functions \n\nThe [Geospatial Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCJDQ/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.analytics.doc/doc/geo_intro.html) provides a set of [geospatial functions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCJDQ/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.analytics.doc/doc/geo_functions.html) that you can use to efficiently process and index spatial data. These functions are integrated into the Data Engine service and ready for immediate use. The Data Engine service also provides several sample queries that illustrate how to use these functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Required user roles", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overview"}]}

With IBM\u00ae Netezza\u00ae Performance Server for IBM Cloud Pak\u00ae for Data as a Service, you can use external tables to access parquet files that are stored outside of your database in data lakes (on AWS S3). Also, you can analyze this data by using the robust and massively parallel Netezza Performance Server execution engine.\n\nExternal data sources use connection strings to specify how you can access an external system. Each connection string describes where your data is placed and how to authenticate to your data source. Each external data source has a definition (schema), but the actual data exists external to the Netezza Performance Server database.\n\nYou cannot backup (nzbackup) and restore (nzrestore) external data source objects.\n\nUse cases for external data source include:\n\n\n\n*  [Running queries against parquet data that is stored in a data lake](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-querying_singularity).\n*  [Ingesting data into Netezza Performance Server](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-ingest_singularity).\n*  [Querying both local and remote data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-merging_singularity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-overview_singularity"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16728-5097-7108", "score": 0.7164306640625, "text": "\n[solution icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/magic-wand.svg) [Best practices for organizing users, teams, applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-users-teams-applications)Best practices for organizing users, teams, applications Solution tutorial\n\nThis tutorial gives an overview of the concepts available in IBM Cloud for identity and access management and how they can be implemented to support the multiple development stages of an application.\n\n![solution tutorial icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/solution-tutorial.svg) [Bring Your Own IP Address](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-byoip)Bring Your Own IP Address Solution tutorial\n\nThis tutorial presents a brief overview of BYOIP implementation patterns that can be used with IBM Cloud and a decision tree for identifying the appropriate pattern when realizing the secure enclosure as described in the Isolate workloads with a secure private network tutorial.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00460-34449-36370", "score": 0.7809543013572693, "text": "\nQuery (_find endpoint) improved\n: IBM Cloudant Query now uses a new method to select an index.

You can use a json or text type of index with IBM Cloudant.\n\nIn the following cases, you can specify how the index is created by making it of type json:\n\n\n\n* You know exactly what data you want to look for.\n* You want to keep storage and processing requirements to a minimum.\n\n\n\nBut for maximum flexibility when you search for data, you typically create an index of type text. Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to /$DATABASE/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body. The type field of the JSON object must be set to json. A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST /$DATABASE/_index HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 0.7751277089118958, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry. Then, [install the open source Portieris project](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) admission controller to block container deployments from unsigned images.\n3. Regularly scan running containers:. Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Depending on the app, to add extra security, you can establish a job that takes down vulnerable containers after they are detected.\n\n\n\nYou can use the built-in container registry to automate the container image build process from your source code in an external source repository to your internal registry. However, images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the internal registry.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Container Registry benefits\n\n Benefit Description \n\n Highly available and scalable private registry.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07949-12261-14447", "score": 0.8195402026176453, "text": "\nCombined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Container Registry \n\nUse [Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview) to store and access private container images. Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. This service is required if using Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Object Storage \n\n[Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage) stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations. Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01438-3222-5394", "score": 0.8095709681510925, "text": "\n* You're using an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster in a [configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-registrycluster_registry_auth_private) that automatically talks to the registry over a private connection.\n* You're accessing Container Registry through a virtual private cloud (VPC) virtual private endpoint gateway (VPE gateway).\n* You're using the Container Registry private IP addresses for configuring network access, for example, in firewalls or Access Control Lists (ACL).\n\n\n\nIf any of the previous statements is true when this change takes effect, the IP addresses in the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker logs change, but you don't need to do anything unless you are also using IAM IP address access restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n What actions you need to take \n\nYou must take the appropriate actions before 23 June 2022.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs.

To organize your functions across these environments, you might choose to create one organization per function. Then, create a space for each environment you need. Instead, you could also have one organization for each environment and create a space per function. No matter how you arrange your organizations and spaces, choose a structure that you can use to effectively manage your function entities.\n\nYou can also use [namespaces](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-namespaces) to isolate resources.

Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift.

For example, Tell me about @product. Or you can reference a context variable, such as Do you have flights to $destination?. Just be sure to design your dialog such that the search is not triggered unless any entities or context variables that you reference in the query have been set to valid values.\n\nThis field is equivalent to the Discovery natural_language_query parameter.

Most of the major SIP trunk providers have existing relationships with IBM. Therefore, the network configuration that is required to support the SIP trunk connection typically can be handled for you with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16250-5445-7809", "score": 0.6382172107696533, "text": "\nTo support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06004-15614-17542", "score": 0.6582822799682617, "text": "\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

Other users of the cluster might have access to the secret, so be sure that you know the secret information can be shared with those users.\n\n\n\n* Personally identifiable information (PII: Store sensitive information such as email addresses or other types of information that are required for company compliance or government regulation in secrets.\n* Credentials: Put credentials such as passwords, keys, and tokens in a secret to reduce the risk of accidental exposure. For example, when you [bind a service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-service-binding) to your cluster, the credentials are stored in a secret.\n\n\n\nWant to make your secrets even more secured?

Jane \u2013 our \"E dev\" here \u2013 needs again to have access to that development repo that she's referring to earlier. Let's go ahead and call this, maybe it's GitHub.

They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done. What it needs, in the form of the secret here, is what we call \"DB configs.\" Again, this DB config is going to allow it to have the correct communication with the service by saying, this is who I am and this is what I came here to accomplish.\n\nBut now that we have our user credentials in our DB configs as examples of secrets, we realize the vulnerability that can be created here if these credentials were to fall into the wrong hands.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step.

Not much of resources is needed for this type of app.\n6. Click Create to deploy the new backend app for the guestbook.\n7. Create a service binding to the database.\n\n\n\n1. Click Service bindings tab.\n2. Click Create.\n3. Click IBM Cloud service instance and choose your database from the drop down.\n4. Click Add.\n\n\n\n8. Wait for the provioning to report as green and ready. Click on Test application, then on Application URL. The backend app should load and return a page saying healthy. Remember or copy the application URL because it is needed for the next part.\n\n\n\nInstead of using the pre-built container image, you could build the image on your own. This can be done either outside of or [with the help of Code Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build).

Given this common terminology, you can create dictionaries to help you categorize and filter the data. The keywords from the example might lead you to create the following dictionaries:\n\n\n\n* component dictionary for terms such as engine and brake\n* phenomenon dictionary for terms such as fire, smoke, and spark\n\n\n\nWhen you apply the dictionary enrichment to your data, it generates annotations. You can think of annotations as tags that you add to words or phrases, where the tag categorizes or identifies the meaning of the word or phrase. The resulting annotations function as new facets that you can use to filter and dissect your data further.\n\nWith your new component and phenomenon facets, for example, you can look for correlations between components and phenomena that are involved in traffic incidents.\n\n[Learn about the ways that you can analyze your data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-cm-analyze-data).\n\n\n\n\n\n Digging deeper \n\nTo dig even deeper into your data, apply or create AI models that can find different types of information in your documents.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.7063522934913635, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6511025428771973, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

See [Digressions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-digressions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding responses \n\n\n\n* Keep answers short and useful.\n* Reflect the user's intent in the response.\n\nDoing so assures users that the bot is understanding them, or if it is not, gives users a chance to correct a misunderstanding.\n* Only include links to external sites in responses if the answer depends on data that changes frequently.\n* Avoid overusing buttons. Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response. Changing one line of text can prevent you from having to write multiple lines of code to implement a complex programmatic solution.\n* Back up your skill frequently.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04175-0-1274", "score": 0.7018718123435974, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining.

Because base models for different languages are independent of each other, as are different models for the same language, updates to individual base models do not affect other models.\n\nWhen a base model is updated, you might need to upgrade any custom models that are built on that base model to take advantage of the improvements. An update to a base model that requires an upgrade produces a new version of the base model (for example, en-US_BroadbandModel.v2020-01-16). An update that does not require an upgrade does not produce a new version.\n\n\n\n* For previous-generation models, all updates to a base model produce a new version of the model.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.6487423777580261, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users.

Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

Clusters on dedicated hosts do not run in a shared environment, instead only your clusters are present on your hosts. Network access control lists protect the subnets that provide the floating IPs for your worker nodes. For more information, see the [VPC documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc). \n High availability The master includes three replicas for high availability. Further, if you create your cluster in a multizone metro, the master replicas are spread across zones and you can also spread your worker pools across zones. For more information, see [High availability for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha). \n Reservations Reservations aren't available for VPC. \n Cluster administration VPC clusters can't be reloaded or updated.

The worker nodes are not connected to the public network, which instead is accessed through a public gateway, floating IP, or VPN gateway.

The templates are applied by using the built-in Terraform, Ansible, Helm, CloudPak, and Operator capabilities in Schematics.\n\nAs part of this getting started tutorial, you create a Schematics Workspaces that points to the [VSI database](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalogabout) template. Then, you run this template and watch Schematics provision your VSI and your IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL instance. IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL is a fully managed database offering in IBM Cloud that supports storing of non-relational and relational data types. For more information about this offering, see [What is PostgreSQL?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/databases-for-postgresql).\n\nThis getting started tutorial incurs costs.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template.

The uplift charge is a percentage (%) of the hourly rate (r), and is added to the hourly rate of the worker node. The total hourly rate cost for a worker node can be calculated as r + (r \u00d7 %). In the [Kubernetes cluster creation console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create), this uplift is reflected in the pricing calculator as you configure your cluster details. The following table describes the pricing uplift by region.\n: For a table that describes the pricing uplift by region, see [Regional pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs).\n\nSustained usage discounts\n: For virtual server instances that are billed at an hourly rate, discounted prices depend on how long the instance runs during the billing month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-costs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13228-7-1544", "score": 0.7112892270088196, "text": "\nProvision vCenter Appliance \n\nThis tutorial may incur costs.

Envelope encryption involves encrypting your data with a Data Encryption Key, then encrypting the Data Encryption Key with a root key. This topic describes the process of envelope encryption and how to use Key Protect to encrypt and decrypt your data.\n\nWhen working with sensitive data, it is important to use advanced encryption techniques to prevent a data breach. If you have large amounts of confidential data, it is often helpful to use a Key Management System to assist in keeping your data secure. Key Protect uses the envelope encryption technique to keep your data resilient. Envelope encryption is the process of using encrypted keys, Data Encryption Keys and Root Keys, to protect your sensitive data.\n\nImagine that you plan to send a letter to a colleague. You want to discuss information that is highly sensitive, so you generate a secret code (Data Encryption Key) that is used to write (encrypt) the message in the letter. The letter is delivered to a mailbox (wrapped Data Encryption Key) that can only be opened by those with a copy of the mailbox key (Root key), including the colleague. Anyone who does not have an exact copy of the key will be unable to open the mailbox and see it's contents. When your colleague uses the key to unlock (unencrypt) the mailbox, they will need to know the secret code that the letter is written in to be able to understand the message. Everyone who is not aware of the secret code will conclude that the letter is a random mix of characters and will not be able to understand the letter's contents.\n\nData encryption keys (DEKs) are designed to encrypt your data and can be generated and managed by your service or an IBM Cloud service.\n\nEnvelope encryption offers several benefits for protecting your data:\n\n\n\n* Protection under a combination of multiple algorithms Envelope encryption uses the best benefits from symmetric and public key algorithms to keep your keys secure.\n\n\n\n1.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match. A third party cannot use the hash without a copy of the original data.\n\nIt is important to be aware with this option that while Orgs A and B cannot see the actual ledger data because it is hashed, they are still able to see that Orgs C and D are transacting and can see the volume of transactions that are occurring between them.\n\nAlso, consider that data inside a private data collection can be purged from the peers that store it.

The DEK itself is never stored, but instead is wrapped by a second key known as the key encryption key (KEK) to create a wrapped DEK.\n\nTo decrypt data, the wrapped DEK must first be unwrapped to get the DEK.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb/vpc/images/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16065-1526-3778", "score": 0.7197934985160828, "text": "\nThese nodes also run a small set of control plane agent services, as described in this table. \n Bare metal nodes Bare metal nodes are delivered to you dedicatedly with VMware ESXi installed during provision.

Your bare metal server API requests are routed to services deployed across control nodes in the region. All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. \n VPC control plane services Your VPC API requests are routed to services deployed across control nodes in the region. These services are replicated for availability and performance across multiple zones in the region whenever necessary. In addition to servicing API requests, these services monitor the region's hardware and capabilities, and perform orchestration to keep your VPC resources available and performing optimally. All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. Since your instances do not run on control nodes, they are separated from these services. \n VPC control plane agent services A small set of VPC control plane agents is deployed across hypervisor nodes in the region. For example, agents are used to create new virtual server instances on the nodes, and to forward logs, metrics, and alerts off the node for use by the broader VPC control plane services. All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. \n VPC control plane data store Your VPC resources are persisted in a data store that is replicated across all zones in the region. This store contains metadata about these resources only, and does not contain your data. For example, this store contains information about each VPC Image resource, such as its name, CRN, and creation date. However, it does not contain the image data itself, which is hosted on the storage devices.

You might alter this architecture for your needs, but it is important to understand the separation of VMware infrastructure networking requirements and the need to separate it from other workload traffic.\n\n\n\n VPC subnets \n\nThe VMkernel networking in VMware provides connectivity to hosts and handles the standard system traffic of vSphere\u00ae vMotion, IP storage, Fault Tolerance, vSAN\u2122, and others. You can also create VMkernel adapters (VMK) on the source and target vSphere Replication hosts to isolate the vSphere replication data traffic.\n\nIt is recommended to take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the management and system traffic in your vSphere environment, such as:\n\n\n\n* Isolate the vMotion traffic in a separate network that includes only the ESXi hosts that participate in the migration.\n* Isolate the management traffic in a network that only network and security administrators can access.\n* Isolate the NSX-T\u2122 TEP traffic only to the Transport Nodes and to interfaces that need access to TEP traffic.\n\n\n\nAs there are various System Traffic Types in VMware, it is recommended to dedicate a separate VMkernel adapter for every System Traffic Type. And also, isolate traffic in logical segments in the underlying network infrastructure and dedicate a distributed port group in distributed switches.\n\nIn IBM Cloud VPC, there are multiple ways to do logical segmentation or isolation. The architecture represented here uses a traditional VLAN segmentation analogy. Each System Traffic Type or VMK has its own VPC subnet that can then be controlled with subnet ACLs.\n\nZoom\n\n![VPC design for VMware deployment](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/5bdb37c0149145723c5437e8176651928565e722/vmwaresolutions/images/vpc-ryo-diagrams-vpc-physical.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

You can restore storage volumes during instance creation, instance modification, or when you provision a new stand-alone volume. For data volumes, you can also use the volumes API to create a data volume from a snapshot.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key.

The Data Security Broker Manager is the cloud-based management console providing scalability, fault tolerance, and manageability of the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n Encryption Technology Configuration Overview: \n\nData Security Broker supports data protection services that can be configured in four main modes.\n\n\n\n Data Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker functions as an application-level encryption (ALE) software in this mode for encrypting data on a field-level basis. This is performed using Data Security Broker Manager to enumerate the data schema and enable an encryption key mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Tokenization: \n\nData Security Broker supports length preserving and data type preserving tokenization method to anonymize data at the field level databases or in semi-structured data files.\n\n\n\n\n\n Record Level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker can be configured for record level encryption to support multiple keys within a single column that are mapped to respective data owners or entities. This encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Masking: \n\nData Security Broker can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration to external parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deployment Plans in IBM Cloud Data Data Security Broker: \n\nWhen you assign and customize default Data Protection Policies with Data Security Broker Manager, there are three options that you can choose to implement your data encryption policy:\n\n\n\n Save Policy: \n\nSave Policy option is selected by default. This option saves your selected data, but does not execute encryption or data protection on your database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new policy is saved to overwrite it. You can use the saved policy to deploy or migrate it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n Deploy Policy: \n\nDeploy Policy option saves your policy and deploys your configured Data Security Broker Shield as a proxy for the configured database.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12678-7-2410", "score": 0.6662138104438782, "text": "\nKnown issues (Limitations) \n\nUse this topic to find the details of the limitations that are applicable to the Data Security Broker software.\n\n\n\n Application-level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker encryption gives database applications a no-code way to implement application-level encryption. Application-level encryption can be implemented by including a database proxy that intercepts and encrypts sensitive data in accordance with the pre-established data protection policy.\n\nData Security Broker encryption has some restrictions, like any other approaches to the application-level encryption implementation. The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location. Alternatively, you can secure the information with a password, but this reduces security, depending on the level of your password's strength.\n\nAccessibility If your key file is lost, your data is also lost. So, make a backup of your data and your key.\n\nDatabase operations carried out on encrypted versions of the data The information is kept in encrypted form in the database and the database engine and, consequently, the database administrator is never permitted to see the information in form of the plaintext.\n\nMany of today's server and network technologies allow for easier configuration and implementation to minimize the impact on utilization.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.

If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03776-3313-5682", "score": 0.7322297096252441, "text": "\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period.

No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

However, VMs have a performance tradeoff when compared to bare metal specs, such as networking Gbps, RAM and memory thresholds, and storage options. Keep in mind these factors that impact your VM costs.\n\n\n\n* Shared versus dedicated: If you share the underlying hardware of the VM, the cost is less than dedicated hardware, but the physical resources are not dedicated to your VM.\n* Hourly billing only: Hourly billing offers more flexibility to order and cancel VMs quickly. You are charged an hourly rate that is metered for only the time that that the worker node is provisioned. The time is not rounded up or down to the nearest hour, but is metered in minutes and charged at the hourly rate. For example, if your worker node is provisioned for 90 minutes, you are charged the hourly rate for 1.5 hours, not 2 hours.\n* Tiered hours per month: The [pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/aboutpricing) is billed hourly in [graduated tiered](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-chargesgraduated_tier). As your VM remains ordered for a tier of hours within a billing month, the hourly rate that you are charged lowers.

With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03771-1594-3365", "score": 0.6688159108161926, "text": "\nThe charges on your invoice are consistent with the usage dashboard.

When you are confident on the feature that you want to roll out is working as intended, increase the percentage over time.\n\nPercentage rollout uses a hashing algorithm that generates a hash based on the rule set. This hash is used by the SDK to generate a percentage value for that user. The percentage value generated for that user is compared to the value set for the percentage rollout value, determines whether the user is eligible to receive that feature or not.\n\nFor example, the hash has partitions from 1 to 100,000. When you assign a feature flag, the hash assigns values from 1 to 100,000 to users in each partition. For example, when you assign 25% to a feature flag, App Configuration SDK delivers that feature to hash partitions from 1 to 25,000. If you change the percentage of users receiving that feature from 25% to 50%, partitions 25,001 to 50,000 would be added to the set of partitions already receiving that feature.\n\nPercentage rollout capability is available for Lite and Enterprise plans.\n\nFollowing are some of the percentage rollout scenarios:\n\n\n\n* If the feature flag is disabled, then SDK returns the default Disabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rules and no percentage rollout is set, then the SDK returns default Enabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rule and percentage rollout is set to 0%, then the SDK returns Disabled value for all users.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-feature-flags"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02680-9660-11121", "score": 0.6533475518226624, "text": "\n@Override\npublic void onConfigurationUpdate() {\n// ADD YOUR CODE\n}\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples for using property and feature-related APIs for Android apps written in Java \n\nRefer to the examples for using the property and feature-related APIs.\n\n\n\n* Get single feature\n\nFeature feature = appConfiguration.getFeature(\"featureId\");\n* Get all features\n\nHashMap<String,Feature> features = appConfiguration.getFeatures();\n* Feature evaluation\n\nYou can use the feature.getCurrentValue() method to evaluate the value of the feature flag.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame. The maximum session inactivity time allowed ranges from 5 minutes to 7 days, depending on your plan type. If you do not add the dialog skill to an assistant, it is your responsibility as the custom application developer to maintain any continuing information that the application needs.\n\nThe application can pass information to the dialog, and the dialog can update this information and pass it back to the application, or to a subsequent node. The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03273-13172-14845", "score": 0.7076066732406616, "text": "\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match.

For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

How does the dialog know which dialog branch to follow? If you enable disambiguation, it can show users their options and ask the user to pick the correct one. See [Disambiguation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating intents \n\n\n\n1.

For example, dialogs used in integrations with channels such as Facebook or Slack skip nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\nFor more information about these built-in nodes, see [Starting and ending the dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-start).\n2. To add more nodes to the dialog tree, click Add node.\n\nYour new node is added after the Welcome node and before the Anything else node.\n3. Add a name to the node.\n\nUse a short, customer-friendly description of what the node does as its name. For example, Open an account, Get policy information, or Get a weather forecast.\n\nThe name can be up to 512 characters in length.\n\nThis node name is shown to customers or service desk personnel to express the purpose of this branch of the dialog, so take some time to add a name that is concise and descriptive.\n4.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

Such a process must adapt to different specifics, based on information provided by customers or otherwise available at run time. For example, the steps for withdrawing money from a savings account might be slightly different from the steps for withdrawing for a checking account.\n\nA step condition is a boolean test, based on some runtime value; the step executes only if the test evaluates as true. This test can be applied to any variable, such as an action variable containing the customer response from a previous step. By defining step conditions, you can create multiple pathways through an action based on different possible runtime values.\n\nFor more information about variables, see [Using variables to manage conversation information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info).\n\nA basic step condition is expressed in the following form:\n\nIf{variable}{operator}{value}\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n* {variable} is the name of a variable or an expression.\n* {operator} is the type of test to apply to the variable value (for example, is or is not).\n* {value} is the value to compare to the variable.\n\n\n\nFor example, a step condition might read:\n\nIfWithdraw from which account?isChecking\n\nThis condition evaluates as true if the customer's response to the previous Withdraw from which account? step is Checking.\n\nConditions can be grouped together to construct complex tests.\n\nTo add a step condition:\n\n\n\n1.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before. The result is a dialog flow that more closely simulates a human-to-human conversation.<-- <ul> --> * Before you begin]] * Customizing digressions]] * Digression usage tips]] * Disabling digressions into a root node]] * Digression tutorial]] * Design considerations]] ! ! ! !!!! ! !", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-109994-112063", "score": 0.7284902334213257, "text": "\nIt is enabled automatically for new English-language dialog skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26 July 2019 \n\nMissing skills issue is resolved\n: In some cases, workspaces that were created through the API only were not being displayed when you opened the Watson Assistant user interface.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

By using industry-standard containers technology, apps can initially be re-hosted on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service quickly without major architectural changes. This change provides the immediate benefit of scalability.\n\nThey can replicate and scale the apps by using defined rules and the automated Kubernetes orchestrator. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides scalable compute resources and the associated DevOps dashboards to create, scale, and tear down apps and services. By using Kubernetes's deployment and runtime objects, the provider can monitor and manage upgrades to apps reliably.\n\nIBM\u00ae Secure Gateway for IBM Cloud\u00ae is used to create a secure pipeline to on-premises databases and documents for apps that are re-hosted to run in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a modern NoSQL database suitable a range of data-driven use cases from key-value to complex document-oriented data storage and query. To minimize queries to the back-office RDBMS, IBM Cloudant is used to cache the user's session data across apps. These choices improve the front-end app usability and performance across the apps on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nMoving compute workloads into the IBM Cloud isn't enough though. The provider needs to go through a methods transformation as well. By adopting the practices of the IBM Garage Method, the provider can implement an agile and iterative delivery process that supports modern DevOps practices like CI/CD.\n\nMuch of the CI/CD process itself is automated with IBM's Continuous Delivery service in the Cloud.

For more information, see [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n\nNamespace\n: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams. For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like kube-system or ibm-system. If you don't designate a namespace when you create a Kubernetes resource, the resource is automatically created in the default namespace. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).\n\nService\n: A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).\n\nDeployment\n: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations. You document a deployment in a configuration YAML file, and then apply it to the cluster. The Kubernetes master configures the resources and deploys containers into pods on the worker nodes with available capacity.\n: Define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06480-1160-2754", "score": 0.7192420363426208, "text": "\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https://developer.ibm.com/depmodels/cloud/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/training/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/35-Connectivity.svg)](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/publiccloud/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06501-7-1686", "score": 0.7148670554161072, "text": "\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

Attachments are Binary Large OBject ([BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object)) files that are included within documents.\n\nIt's a good idea to keep attachments small in size and number because attachments can impact performance.\n\nThe BLOB is stored in the _attachments component of the document. The BLOB holds data that includes the following information:\n\n\n\n* The attachment name\n* The type of the attachment\n* The actual content\n\n\n\nExamples of BLOBs would be images and multimedia.\n\nIf you include the attachment as an [inline](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachmentsinline) component of the overall JSON, the attachment content is represented by using BASE64 form.\n\nThe content type corresponds to a [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_typeList_of_common_media_types). For example, if you want to attach a .jpg image file to a document, you specify the attachment MIME type as image/jpeg.\n\nAttachments aren't permitted on documents in [_replicator](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostreplicate) or [_users](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantputsecurity) databases.\n\n\n\n Create or update \n\nTo create a new attachment at the same time as creating a new document, include the attachment as an [inline](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachmentsinline) component of the JSON content.\n\nTo create a new attachment on an existing document, or to update an attachment on a document, make a PUT request with the document's most recent _rev to https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID/$ATTACHMENT.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00556-10831-12062", "score": 0.6515090465545654, "text": "\nThe content must be provided by using [BASE64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) representation, as shown in the example.\n\nA full list of media types is available in the [media types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_typeList_of_common_media_types) article.\n\nSee the following example JSON document that includes an inline attachment of a jpeg image:\n\n{\n\"_id\":\"document_with_attachment\",\n\"_attachments\":\n{\n\"name_of_attachment\": {\n\"content_type\":\"image/jpeg\",\n\"data\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAA... ...AASUVORK5CYII=\"\n}\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Performance considerations \n\nWhile document attachments are useful, they do have implications for application performance. In particular, having too many attachments can have an adverse performance impact during replication.\n\nFor example, if your application requires storage for multiple images as attachments or includes large images, you must use an alternative [BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object) storage mechanism to store the images. You might then use IBM Cloudant to keep the image metadata, such as URLs to the BLOB store.\n\nYou might find it helpful to do performance testing for your specific application to determine which approach works best for your circumstances.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06968-15099-17180", "score": 0.6461840867996216, "text": "\n[checkmark icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/icons/checkmark-icon.svg) \n\n\n\n\n\n* PDF files that are secured with a password or certificate are not supported.

By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill.

For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment.

To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own.

For information about how the system handles dictionaries in different languages, see [Dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-dictionarieswks_dictionaries).\n\n> Note: The rule editor and rule-based model cannot handle bidirectional text, so cannot be used with Arabic documents.\n\n> Restrictions:\n>\n> Because of character restrictions in the underlying machine learning technology, entries in the type system cannot contain spaces and can include only the following ASCII characters:\n>\n> \n>\n>\n>  *  A through Z and a through z\n>  *  0 through 9\n>  *  The underscore character: _\n>\n>\n> \n>\n>\n> The following rules also apply:\n>\n> \n>\n>\n>  *  The first character in the name must be alphabetical.\n>  *  The entity type name length cannot exceed 64 characters.\n>  *  The relation type name length cannot exceed 128 characters.\n>\n>\n> \n>\n>\n> Thus, for example, when a human annotator annotates Japanese text in the ground truth editor, the entity type and relation type names that can be applied will not be in Japanese.\n\n\n\n  Related tasks \n\n[Configuring support for Arabic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-wks_langsupp_ar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-199341-201521", "score": 0.7624669075012207, "text": "\nAnd the links between nodes are represented in a way that makes it easier to understand the relationships between the nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n 21 June 2017 \n\nArabic support\n: Language support for Arabic is now generally available.

The feature is able to map user input to the appropriate corresponding entity despite the presence of misspellings or slight syntactical differences. For example, if you define giraffe as a synonym for an animal entity, and the user input contains the terms giraffes or girafe, the fuzzy match is able to map the term to the animal entity correctly.

All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee mandates that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing an assistant language \n\nAfter an assistant is created, its language cannot be modified.\n\n\n\n\n\n Working with accented characters \n\nIn a conversational setting, users might or might not use accents with the Watson Assistant service. As such, both accented and nonaccented versions of words might be treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever, for some languages like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity might implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the nonaccented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word \"barri\u00f3\", which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb \"barrer\" (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word \"barrio\" (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system provides the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio isn't detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 isn't detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words that use the Spanish letter \u00f1 versus the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" versus \"una\". In this case, the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13252-4455-6437", "score": 0.7589905858039856, "text": "\nThe service supports many languages and dialects:\n\n\n\n* Arabic (Modern Standard)\n* Chinese (Mandarin)\n* Czech\n* Dutch (Belgian and Netherlands)\n* English (Australian, Indian, United Kingdom, and United States)\n* French (Canadian and France)\n* German\n* Hindi (Indian)\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Korean\n* Portuguese (Brazilian)\n* Spanish (Castilian and Latin American)\n* Swedish\n\n\n\nFor more information about the supported languages and about using previous- and next-generation models for speech recognition, see [Using languages and models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-featuresfeatures-languages).\n\n\n\n\n\n Audio support \n\nThe service accepts audio for transcription in many popular formats:\n\n\n\n* Ogg or Web Media (WebM) audio with the Opus or Vorbis codec\n* MP3 (or MPEG)\n* Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)\n* Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\n* Linear 16-bit Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)\n* G.729\n* A-Law\n* Mu-law (or u-law)\n* Basic audio\n\n\n\nFor more information about the supported audio formats and their characteristics, see [Using audio formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-featuresfeatures-audio).\n\n\n\n\n\n Integrated use cases \n\nYou can use the Speech to Text service with other Watson services to create applications with even greater scope and functionality:\n\n\n\n* AI assistant on the phone - Eliminate hold times and improve customer satisfaction with IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant phone integration.

Some of these views are designated as output views, while others are non-output views. Non-output views can include some views that are imported into or exported from a module. It is important to note that output views and exported views are orthogonal. For example, a view that is exported does not qualify as a view that is output. In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module.

The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical.

You cannot replace the list, which means you cannot remove stop words that are part of the default list in v2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Update how your application handles query results \n\nThe way that your application shows query results might need to be updated due to the following differences between the query results document syntax between the v1 and v2 queries:\n\n\n\n* At the entity enrichment level, the following information is not supported in v2:\n\n\n\n* Disambiguation\n* Emotion\n* Sentiment\n\n\n\nThe Part of Speech enrichment is applied automatically to documents in most project types in v2, but the index fields that are generated by the enrichment are not displayed in the JSON representation of the document.\n\nZoom\n\n![Difference in entities data structure](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/discovery-data/images/compare-result-syntax.png)\n\nFigure 1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-migrate-to-v2"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04488-121251-122072", "score": 0.6393182873725891, "text": "\ne9b08526-3227-406c-b83f-c28844bd952b my-test-key-9\n3ee0d859-2968-4444-8e4d-3d28614f055c my-test-key-10\nbc459a2f-56cb-445e-b4ee-9d1866b57560 my-test-key-11\n62090ba8-7363-408e-9edc-aa9fb69c09be my-test-key-12\n3b4b0511-00df-48e6-ad65-fad35bb6ce17 my-test-key-13\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14\n3d683d56-d340-40cb-b8b6-605dcfded01f my-test-key-15\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n54dd2745-7718-487f-85e6-a67e758dd945 my-test-key-17\n3a5a3b52-6942-463d-9f7a-5b216bbf5123 my-test-key-18\n90138be5-1dd1-4eea-b7c1-73cc8609e7f7 my-test-key-19\ncf0a3d8b-4856-4aa5-be6a-88cca465eab0 my-test-key-20\n\n this is the same list sorted in KEY_ID order\n this is the order we expect when listing keys\n\n10954149-0217-472d-8137-42fc330dbd03 my-test-key-16\n16276369-ba81-4eb5-be92-f13512147ad4 my-test-key-14", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-key-protect-cli-reference"}]}

[Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-actions-overviewactions-overview-actions). \n Assistant Container for your skills. You add skills to an assistant, and then deploy the assistant when you are ready to start helping your customers. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants). \n Condition Logic that is defined in the If assistant recognizes section of a dialog node that determines whether the node is processed. The dialog node conditions is equivalent to an If statement in If-Then-Else programming logic. \n Content catalog A set of prebuilt intents that are categorized by subject, such as customer care. You can add these intents to your skill and start using them immediately. Or you can edit them to complement other intents that you create. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-catalog). \n Context variable A variable that you can use to collect information during a conversation, and reference it later in the same conversation. For example, you might want to ask for the customer's name and then address the person by name later on. A context variable is used by the dialog skill.

If you specify true for this option, the returned skill context includes an encoded state property that represents the current conversation state.\n\nIf you are using the stateful message API, the service stores conversation state data only for the life of the session. However, if you save this context data (including state) and send it back to the service with a subsequent message request, you can restore the conversation to the same state, even if the original session expired or was deleted.\n\nIf you are using the stateless message API, the state property is always included in responses (along with the rest of context). Although stateless sessions do not expire, you can still use this state data to reset a conversation to a previous state.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client-get-context"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03233-4-2095", "score": 0.7788382768630981, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience. To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Personalizing the dialog with context \n\nTo personalize the conversation, your assistant can collect information from the customer and then refer back to it later in the conversation.\n\n\n\n Retaining information across dialog turns \n\nThe dialog in a dialog skill is stateless, meaning that it does not retain information from one interaction with the user to the next. When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame. The maximum session inactivity time allowed ranges from 5 minutes to 7 days, depending on your plan type. If you do not add the dialog skill to an assistant, it is your responsibility as the custom application developer to maintain any continuing information that the application needs.\n\nThe application can pass information to the dialog, and the dialog can update this information and pass it back to the application, or to a subsequent node. The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node. You can also reference a context variable from dialog node response conditions to show different reponses depending on a value provided by an external service or by the user.\n\nLearn more:\n\n\n\n* [Passing context from the application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-from-app)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime-context"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03282-4605-6541", "score": 0.778382420539856, "text": "\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks. I want to open a savings account and apply for a credit card. How does the dialog recognize and address both of them? See the [Compound questions](https://sodoherty.ai/2017/02/06/compound-questions/) entry from Simon O'Doherty's blog for strategies you can try. (Simon is a developer on the Watson Assistant team.)\n* Dealing with ambiguous intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish that is ambiguous enough that your assistant finds two or more nodes with intents that could potentially address it. How does the dialog know which dialog branch to follow? If you enable disambiguation, it can show users their options and ask the user to pick the correct one. See [Disambiguation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity. But, using @appliance:(air conditioner) gets expanded to entity['appliance'].contains('air conditioner'), which matches whenever there is at least one @appliance entity of value 'air conditioner' detected in the user input.\n* Hiding data from the log: You can prevent information from being stored in Watson logs by storing it in a context variable and nesting the context variable within the $private section of the message context. For example: $private.my_info. Storing data in the private object hides it from the logs only. The information is still stored in the underlying JSON object.

For more information, see [User-based plans explained](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-managing-planadmin-managing-plan-user-based).\n\nThere are two types of context:\n\n\n\n* Global context: context variables that are shared by all skills that are used by an assistant, including internal system variables that are used to manage conversation flow. The global context includes the user ID and other global values such as the time zone and language of the assistant.\n* Skill-specific context: context variables specific to a particular skill, including any user-defined variables needed by your application. Currently, only one skill (named main skill) is supported.\n\n\n\nUser-defined context variables that you specify in a dialog node are part of the user_defined object within the skill context when accessed by using the API. This structure differs from the context structure that appears in the JSON editor in the Watson Assistant user interface. For example, you might specify the following code in the JSON editor:\n\n\"context\": {\n\"my_context_var\": \"this is the value\"\n}\n\nIn the v2 API, you would access this user-defined variable as follows:\n\n\"context\": {\n\"skills\": {\n\"main skill\": {\n\"user_defined\": {\n\"my_context_var\": \"this is the value\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\nFor more information about how to access context variables by using the API, see the [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\n\n\n Example \n\nThe following example shows a stateful /message request that includes both global and skill-specific context variables; it also uses the options.return_context property to request that the context is returned with the response.

After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame.

Therefore, the version in cache is considered valid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: For event-driven content, purge your cache \n\nFor example, every time a new post is added to your blog, you could easily purge the CIS cache. It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https://www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com/\n* www.example.com/foo/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path. It can also simplify the number of purge calls made.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only) \n\nPurging by hostname is similar to purging by prefixes. Use a list of hostnames to purge the cache of any assets associated with those hostnames.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by tags (Enterprise only)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment-for-best-performance"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09087-57111-58221", "score": 0.6830621361732483, "text": "\n\"deleted\": false\n}\n]\n}\n\n step 3 - capture the key id\n$ KEY_ID=aa713df1-857c-4c46-be80-3051756280c9\n\n step 4 - allow the expiration date to pass by sleeping for 1 (one) minute\n$ sleep 60\n\n step 5 - delete the key\n$ ibmcloud kp key delete $KEY_ID\n\nDeleting key: 'aa713df1-857c-4c46-be80-3051756280c9', from instance: 'a192d603-0b8d-452f-aac3-f9e1f95e7411'...\nOK\nDeleted Key\naa713df1-857c-4c46-be80-3051756280c9\n\n step 6 - fails because you cannot restore a deleted key after the expiration date\n$ curl -X POST \"https://us-south.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/$KEY_ID/restore\" -H \"authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" -H \"bluemix-instance: $KP_INSTANCE_ID\" -H \"content-type: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key_action+json\" -d '{\n\"metadata\": {\n\"collectionType\": \"application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json\",\n\"collectionTotal\": 1\n},\n\"resources\": [\n{\n\"payload\": \"'$KEY_MATERIAL'\"\n}\n]\n}'\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n JSON response \n\n{\n\"metadata\": {\n\"collectionType\": \"application/vnd.ibm.kms.error+json\",\n\"collectionTotal\": 1\n},\n\"resources\": [\n{\n\"errorMsg\": \"Bad Request: The key expired on 2020-08-14 19:33:47 +0000 UTC: Key could not be restored.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-error-messages"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09087-56517-57355", "score": 0.681789219379425, "text": "\n\"expirationDate\": \"'$EXPIRE'\",\n\"extractable\": false\n}\n]\n}'\nShow more\n\n\n\n JSON response \n\n{\n\"metadata\": {\n\"collectionType\": \"application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json\",\n\"collectionTotal\": 1\n},\n\"resources\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json\",\n\"id\": \"aa713df1-857c-4c46-be80-3051756280c9\",\n\"name\": \"Root-key-1\",\n\"description\": \"example-key\",\n\"state\": 1,\n\"expirationDate\": \"2020-08-14T19:33:47Z\",\n\"extractable\": false,\n\"crn\": \"crn:v1:bluemix:public:kms:us-south:a/ea998d3389c3473aa0987652b46fb146:a192d603-0b8d-452f-aac3-f9e1f95e7411:key:aa713df1-857c-4c46-be80-3051756280c9\",\n\"imported\": true,\n\"deleted\": false\n}\n]\n}\n\n step 3 - capture the key id\n$ KEY_ID=aa713df1-857c-4c46-be80-3051756280c9\n\n step 4 - allow the expiration date to pass by sleeping for 1 (one) minute\n$ sleep 60\n\n step 5 - delete the key\n$ ibmcloud kp key delete $KEY_ID", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-error-messages"}]}

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions. This is typically defined as a DR architecture.\n\nThe benefits of using a [DR orchestrator](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-cloud-resiliency-orchestrator) are covered in the context of a cloud environment and its fast changing behavior. You might require several integrations with management tools and services in IBM Cloud\u00ae. Examples throughout these best practices are provided to demonstrate the native capabilities and documentation currently available to implement DR for IBM Cloud services and suggest additional services that are often required to implement an enterprise-level resiliency solution.\n\nThe best practices in this section are based on the services and features currently available and might change over time. We recommend that you verify possible changes or additional features that might apply to your environment.\n\n\n\n General disaster recovery strategy \n\nThe approach to defining your DR strategy needs to be systematic and start with the application or service, which is defined as a set of compute resources, for example Kubernetes apps, virtual machines, services, and more, that make up a business application.\n\nWhile a holistic approach might be wanted, the reality is that each business application (cloud service) is independent, with its own", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-dr"}]}

Unbound GRE tunnels provide the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The ability to receive classic network subnets from a classic connection.\n* The ability to communicate through other unbound GRE tunnels on the same transit gateway in the same availability zone.\n* Does not require a classic connection on the transit gateway.

Defining one or more sets of rules.\n2. Applying a set of rules to an interface or a zone. A zone consists of one or more network interfaces.\n\n\n\nIt is important to test firewall rules after creation to ensure the rules work as intended and that new rules do not restrict administrative access to the device.\n\nWhile manipulating rules on the dp0bond1 interface, it is advised to connect to the device using dp0bond0.

A stateless firewall will need rules for traffic in both directions, while stateful firewalls track connections and automatically allow the returning traffic of accepted flows.

When the team does start to annotate documents, begin with a small set, perhaps no more than 50. Annotate only mentions initially, examine the results, and refine your annotation guidelines and the type system as needed. When you're satisfied with the results of mention annotation, move on to annotate relations and coreferences.\n\nWhile fundamental work is underway to define a set of entity types and mention-annotation guidelines, avoid putting a lot of effort into annotating relation mentions. Mention changes will undo relation annotation work. Do take some time to define a set of relation types and their allowable entity type pairs so that relation type needs are taken into consideration before the entity type inventory is finalized.\n\nExpect the type system to evolve with the experience of people trying to annotate to it. If you revise the type system after you create human annotation tasks, you must decide whether to apply the changes to each task. If you apply the changes, human annotators will have to revisit the documents that they annotated previously.\n\nWhen you test the model, you can review statistics that show how frequently the entity types and relation types occur in your sample documents. Be sure to review these statistics.

You can remove the additional worker nodes after the update is completed.\n\nIn addition, you can create a Kubernetes config map that specifies the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time, such as during an update.

These services, called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), are packaged as virtual machines (VMs) on commodity hardware, which allows service providers to run their networks on standard servers instead of proprietary ones. This third-party software interacts with the IBM Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller to offer easy configuration, centralized management, and lower operational costs.\n\nWorking along with IBM Cloud\u00ae Schematics (Infrastructure as Code) and the IBM Content catalog, customers are able to instantiate best-in-network solutions to manage their workload.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n\n\n*  Instantiating virtual network services and modifying configurations without the need to deploy new network hardware.\n*  Rapid service delivery with the agility to scale well above physical hardware.\n*  Centralized policy control.\n*  Using the same routers, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs in IBM Cloud that were used in physical hardware or other cloud providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13079-7-2117", "score": 0.6957395076751709, "text": "\nFAQs \n\nYou can read the following FAQs to help you with Hyper Protect Virtual Servers.\n\n\n\n Are there any backup functions provided for a virtual server? \n\nHyper Protect Virtual Servers does not provide any backup functions for your virtual server instances. If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 / 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance.

You can use network load balancers with routing mode to perform health checks and to ensure that workloads only travel through healthy VNF devices. Because of this, network load balancers with routing mode support only VNF devices as back-end targets.\n\nFor detailed examples of various ways you can deploy your NLB with routing mode, refer to [HA VNF deployments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha&interface=ui).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites for NLB with routing mode \n\nTo support routing mode, you must first create a service-to-service authentication policy for your NLB.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "score": 0.7028577327728271, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple.

For more information, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).\n\nUse this method to send sensitive information in messages that come from your website, such as information about a customer's loyalty level, a user ID, or security tokens to use in webhooks that you call from actions. Information passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private context variable. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for a standard customer. You do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such, but you must pass this information to your action so it can change the flow of the conversation. To do this, you can pass the customer MVP status as an encrypted variable. This private context variable is available for use by the action, but not by anything else.\n\n![development icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/development-icon.png)Tutorial: For a tutorial that shows an example of using web chat security to authenticate users and protect sensitive data, see [Tutorial: Authenticating a user in the middle of a session](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-security).\n\nTo encrypt sensitive data:\n\n\n\n1.

To open the web chat based on some other interaction, use the [openWindow](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodsopenwindow) instance method.\n\n![development icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/development-icon.png)Tutorial: For a tutorial that shows you how to implement a custom launcher, see [Using a custom launcher](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=tutorials-launcher).\n\nKeeping the web chat always open", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.6878854036331177, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

This example looks up the element using the ID we assigned to it:\n\nconst customElement = document.querySelector('WebChatContainer');\n3.

You should perform robust testing before deploying these integrations in production.\n\n\n\n* [Bring your own](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-web-chat-service-desk-starter): A web chat service desk extension starter kit that enables you to develop your own service desk integrations.\n\n\n\nAfter you set up the service desk integration, you must update your dialog to ensure it understands user requests to speak to someone, and can transfer the conversation properly. For more information, see [Adding chat transfer support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-supportdialog-support-transfers).\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat integration limits \n\nThe usage is measured differently depending on the plan type. For Lite plans, usage is measured by the number of /message calls (API) are sent to the assistant from the web chat integration. For all other plans, usage is measured by the number of monthly active users (MAU) that the web chat interacts with. The maximum number of allowed MAUs differs depending on your Watson Assistant plan type.\n\n\n\nPlan details\n\n Plan Maximum usage \n\n Enterprise Unlimited MAU \n Premium (legacy) Unlimited MAU", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.6659125685691833, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}]}

If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03350-1645-3623", "score": 0.6401040554046631, "text": "\nIf customers ask about one of these topics in the meantime, the anything_else node is triggered to explain that the assistant can't help with the current request, but can help them with other things.\n\n\n\n Irrelevance detection \n\nThe irrelevance detection feature helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore. This feature helps your skill recognize irrelevant inputs earlier in the development process.\n\nTo test irrelevance detection in the \"Try it out\" pane, submit one or more utterances that have absolutely nothing to do with your training data. Irrelevance deteciton helps your skill to correctly recognize that the test utterances do not map to any of the intents defined in your training data, and classifies them as being Irrelevant.\n\nThe algorithmic models that help your assistant understand what your users say are built from two key pieces of information:\n\n\n\n* Subjects you want the assistant to address. For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Counterexample limits \n\nThe maximum number of counterexamples that you can create for any plan type is 25,000.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-irrelevance-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-83511-85525", "score": 0.6351638436317444, "text": "\nService desk transfer support continues to be a beta feature.

This enhancement means that the assistant can recognize an entity value that is defined in its singular form but mentioned in its plural form in user input. It also can recognize conjugated forms of a verb that is specified as an entity value.\n\nFor example, if your French-language dialog skill has an entity value of animal, it recognizes the plural form of the word (animaux) when it is mentioned in user input.

The irrelevance detection model helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore. This enhanced model helps your skill recognize irrelevant inputs earlier in the development process.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of the new algorithm, read the [Why Zero-Effort Irrelevance is Relevant](https://medium.com/ibm-watson/enhanced-offtopic-90b2dadf0ef1) blog post.\n\nThe new algorithm is enabled automatically for any English-language skills that you import or create.\n\nTo test the new detection mechanism in the Try it out pane, submit one or more utterances that have absolutely nothing to do with your training data.

For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-25501-27738", "score": 0.6941128969192505, "text": "\n* New [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant) focuses on the workflow of building, deploying, and improving your assistant.\n\n\n\nYou can easily switch to the new Watson Assistant and try it out.

At run time, covid19 is predicted as 100% confident for the covid intent, and hospital around palm beach is predicted as 100% confident for the find_provide_master intent.\n\nThis update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model. For more information, see [Accessing intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-expression-languageexpression-language-intent).\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 March 2022 \n\nFuzzy matching updates\n: Previously, an update was made so that interactions between the stemming and misspelling fuzzy matching features were not allowed. This change applied to the following languages: English, French, German, and Czech. This was updated so that this change applies only to the English language.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"}]}

If a dedicated language model is not available for your target language, create a skill that uses the universal language model. The universal model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from training data written in the target language that you add to it.\n\nThe universal model is available as a beta feature. For more information, see [Understanding the universal language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-languagewatson-assistant-language-universal).\n\nActions skill improvement\n: Now you can indicate whether or not to ask for a number when you apply a number reply constraint to a step. Test how changes to this setting might help speed up a customer's interaction. Under the right circumstances, it can be useful to let a number mention be recognized and stored without having to explicitly ask the customer for it.

In the simplest case, the text you specify here can more explicitly state the type of information you need the user to provide. If you use this action with a conditional response, be sure to word the conditional response such that you clearly state what was wrong with the user's answer and what you expect them to provide instead.\n* Prompt again: After displaying the Not found response, your assistant repeats the slot prompt again and waits for the user to respond. If you use this action with a conditional response, the response can merely explain what was wrong about the answer the user provided. It does not need to reiterate the type of information you want the user to provide because the slot prompt typically explains that.\n\nIf you choose this option, consider adding at least one variation of the Not found response so that the user does not see the exact same text more than once. Take the opportunity to use different wording to explain to the user what information you need them to provide and in what format.\n* Skip this slot: Instructs your assistant to stop trying to fill the current slot, and instead, move on to the prompt for the next empty slot. This option is useful in a slot where you want to both make the slot optional and to display a prompt that asks the user for information. For example, you might have a @seating entity that captures restaurant seating preferences, such as outside, near the fireplace, private, and so on. You can add a slot that prompts the user with, Do you have any seating preferences? and checks for @seating.values. If a valid response is provided, it saves the preference information to $seating_preferences. However, by choosing this action as the Not found response next step, you instruct your assistant to stop trying to fill this slot if the user does not provide a valid value for it.\n* Skip to response: If, when the condition you define is met, you no longer need to fill any of the remaining slots in this node, choose this action to skip the remaining slots and go directly to the node-level response next.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-slots"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12825-6626-7125", "score": 0.5604191422462463, "text": "\nAfter you add all of your product's support details, provide the required URLs for your product.\n5.
