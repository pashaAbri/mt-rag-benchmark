As such, an update has been made to the algorithm so that accented and non-accented versions of words are treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever, for some languages like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word barri\u00f3, which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb barrer (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word barrio (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents.

(For more information about customer response types, see [Collecting information from your customer](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-collect-info).) The assistant checks the customer's response to make sure it fits the expected response type; this process is called validation.\n\nFor most customer response types, the assistant is able to understand valid responses provided in a variety of formats. For example, for a time value, 2:15 PM and a quarter past two in the afternoon are both acceptable. But if the user provides a value that the assistant cannot interpret as matching the expected response type (for example, a response of purple when asked for a number), a validation error results.\n\nWhen there is a validation error, the assistant asks the customer to try again.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-handle-errors"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16261-10613-12744","score":13.477467325,"text":"\nBecause we need a way to end the conversation, the client app is also watching for the literal command quit to indicate that the program should exit.\n\nBut something still isn't right:\n\nWelcome to the Watson Assistant example.

Please rephrase your question.\n>> I want to make an appointment.\nWhat day would you like to come in?\n>> Thursday\nI'm afraid I don't understand. Please rephrase your question.\n>>\n\nThe assistant is starting out with the correct greeting, but it doesn't understand when you tell it your name. And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16314-2927-4978","score":13.1639885959,"text":"\nAdd a step or edit an existing step to transfer the conversation to a live agent.\n\nTransferring the conversation to a live agent ends the action.

The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response.

Following are the three key concepts in RAID:\n\n\n\n* Mirroring: copying data to more than one disk\n* Striping: splitting data across more than one disk\n* Error correction (fault tolerance): redundant data is stored to allow problems to be detected and possibly fixed.\n\n\n\nAlthough many different levels of RAID exist, IBM chooses to support the most common RAID types: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity \/ Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read\/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05138-7979-9034","score":21.2538512409,"text":"\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

This ensures that there are separate administration domains for the compute and storage clusters; therefore, SSH between nodes from different clusters is not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the Spectrum Scale offering support multiple key_pairs to establish SSH to all of the nodes? \n\nNo, the current version of the Spectrum Scale offering supports only a single key_pair that can be provided for access to all of the nodes that are part of the cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I use my own resource group to configure the resources? \n\nYes, you can provide the resource group of your choice for the deployment of your cluster's VPC resources.

For storage nodes, only RHEL 8.4 is supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why does Spectrum Scale not allow use of the default value of 0.0.0.0\/0 for security group creation? \n\nFor security reasons, Spectrum Scale does not allow you to provide a default value that would allow network traffic from any external device.

This rate is equal to a starting cost of USD $0.105 per hour. You can toggle the provisioned throughput capacity up or down by using the user interface or API. Toggle in increments of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation.

Words from a custom model are in competition with words from the service's base vocabulary as well as other words of the model. (Factors such as audio noise and speaker accents also affect the quality of transcription.)\n\nThe accuracy of transcription can depend largely on how words are defined in a model and how speakers say them. To improve the service's accuracy, use corpora to provide as many examples as possible of how OOV words are used in the domain. Repeating the OOV words in corpora can improve the quality of the custom language model. How you duplicate the words in corpora depends on how you expect users to say them in the audio that is to be recognized. The more sentences that you add that represent the context in which speakers use words from the domain, the better the service's recognition accuracy.\n\nThe service does not apply a simple word-matching algorithm. Its transcription depends on the context in which words are used. When it parses a corpus, the service includes information about n-grams (bi-grams, tri-grams, and so on) from the sentences of the corpus in the custom model. This information helps the service transcribe audio with greater accuracy, and it explains why training a custom model on corpora is more valuable than training it on custom words alone.\n\nFor example, accountants adhere to a common set of standards and procedures that are known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). When you create a custom model for a financial domain, provide sentences that use the term GAAP in context. The sentences help the service distinguish between general phrases such as \"the gap between them is small\" and domain-centric phrases such as \"GAAP provides guidelines for measuring and disclosing financial information.\"\n\nIn general, it is better for corpora to use words in different contexts, which can improve how the service learns the words.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-corporaWords"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16628-0-1541","score":13.3840435328,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  About Visual Explain \n\nThe visual explain feature in IBM\u00ae watsonx.data shows the execution plan for a specified SQL query. This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The provisioned throughput capacity is a reserved number of reads per second, writes per second, and global queries per second allocated to an instance. The throughput capacity setting is the maximum usage level for a given second.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricing).\n\n\n\n  Can I change my capacity setting? \n\nYou can change your provisioned throughput capacity and see your current capacity settings in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.

You can also use the IBM Cloud\u00ae pricing calculator to see estimates in other currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How do I know I exceeded the capacity limit that I set? \n\nThe Lite plan includes 1 GB of storage.

MFA is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA).\n\nThe following two types of MFA options might be enabled for your account:\n\nID-based MFA\n: ID-based MFA is the preferred method for requiring MFA in an account. This type of MFA is associated with each users' ID and authenticates them across all accounts that they are a member of, so they authenticate only one time. This type of MFA overrides the legacy account-based MFA options.\n: ID-based MFA applies to all resources in any type of account. When ID-based MFA is enabled, a user is prompted to provide a unique identifier (such as a username or email) and a one-time password (OTP) generated by an authenticator app or a hardware token. After the correct OTP is entered, access is granted to the requested resource. This type of MFA is much more secure than account-based MFA because it is not limited to classic infrastructure resources and applies to all resources within the account. It also reduces the risk of a breach because of a weak password or the use of the same password across multiple accounts.\n\nAccount-based MFA\n:\nClassic infrastructure\n\nAccount-based MFA applies only to classic infrastructure and not to other resources in your account. Unlike with ID-based MFA, legacy MFA options, such as security questions, are enforced only on the specific account where the MFA is enabled. If you have a different legacy MFA option set up for each account that you are a member of, you must authenticate in a different way each time that you switch accounts.\n\nLegacy account-based MFA was available to accounts with classic infrastructure prior to the release of ID-based MFA. This legacy offering continues to work for accounts with classic infrastructure and requires the user to provide a secondary authentication input when logging in or switching to accounts with classic infrastructure. Non-classic resources are not secured by this legacy offering. ID-based MFA is for customers that want to implement MFA to secure the full range of IBM Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n ID-based MFA options","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-types"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02379-11265-13416","score":13.5731741753,"text":"\nbilling.account-mfa.set-off An event is generated when the Account Login setting sets off multifactor authentication in the account. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Events for managing organizations \n\nThe following table lists the actions that generate an event:\n\n\n\nTable 12.

Recently, you might have heard about Heroku changing their policy on free - the free tier. It's causing a challenge for a lot of developers out there so I want to take a handful of moments here to show you how you can migrate from Heroku to Code Engine from IBM Cloud in just a handful of steps. So let's go ahead and start playing around with it and see how quickly you can actually make your system work.\n\nSo first thing first, if you haven't seen it this is the actual line inside the official blog from Heroku, starting on November 28, 2022, we plan to stop free - offering the free product plans and plan on shutting down the free dynos and data services. We'll be sending out a series of email communications to affected users. This is challenging for a lot of beginner beginner web applications. I know for a fact personally I used Heroku when I first started back in the day so this is a pretty large hit for a lot of people and I want to show you how easy it is to convert from Heroku to Code Engine.\n\nSo first thing first, let's actually see a nice little application I've created. If I go ahead and bring up my application here, we have a nice little flask app. If you don't know what python is or flask is, it's a it's a format for python to be able to run an application on a standard port. So let's say we have this application; it says \u201cHello World!\u201d. I've already deployed it and we can check out right here We have our amazing production app at heroku.com. It says \u201chello world\u201d and we want to go ahead and change it. We wanted to update it so I'm going to go ahead and quickly update it to \u201cHello Moving from Heroku to Code Engine\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and come out of it. git add .git commit -m \u201cupdate hello line\u201d.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06992-7451-9420","score":11.387968197,"text":"\n* To crawl a specific user, enter box:\/\/app.box.com\/user\/USER'S_ACCOUNT_ID\/.\n\n\n\n9.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\nTo learn more about creating intents, watch the following 2 1\/2-minute video.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07118-1554-3174","score":30.8305021288,"text":"\nGo to the [Discovery resource](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalog\/services\/watson-discovery) page in the IBM Cloud catalog and create a Plus plan service instance.\n\n\n\nIf you decide to stop using the Plus plan and don't want to pay for it, delete the Plus plan service instance before the 30-day trial period ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Create an assistant \n\nFor this tutorial, you will create an assistant with a single action.

Catalog syntax is compatible with Hive metastore syntax. See how to [work with the catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogusage) and refer to the [Catalog management](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterHiveCatalog) section of the SQL reference.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\nYou can explore, change, or discover structured data on [Cloud Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage\/getting-started.htmlgetting-started-console) with Data Engine by using SQL syntax. To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13472-3084-5036","score":39.3507997813,"text":"\n* Prepare your data first.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks.

Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks.

The Target location field displays where the result is stored. An initial bucket in one of your Object Storage instances is automatically created for you when you open the UI.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01533-4-2366","score":35.7414609712,"text":"\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

You can use the ibmcloud cr va-version command to determine which Vulnerability Advisor version is being used and the ibmcloud cr va-version-set v4 command to switch to Vulnerability Advisor version 4. When Vulnerability Advisor version 3 reaches its end of support date, any Container Registry CLI commands that access Vulnerability Advisor version 3 cease to work. An end of support date is not available yet.\n\nIf you use the Vulnerability Advisor REST API to access Vulnerability Advisor, you must update your client call from \/va\/api\/v3 APIs to \/va\/api\/v4 APIs.\n\nIf you use one of the Vulnerability Advisor version 3 SDKs to access Vulnerability Advisor, you must update to the Vulnerability Advisor version 4 SDK.\n\nAny exemptions that you previously defined continue to work.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01329-58331-60199","score":21.0950221409,"text":"\nibmcloud cr va-version-set \n\nSet the version of Vulnerability Advisor.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_01533-4-2366","score":20.7118663943,"text":"\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

Dedicated hosts offer virtual server provisioning capacity and maximum placement control.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the benefits of using dedicated hosts over dedicated instances? \n\nBoth offerings are guaranteed single tenancy. Dedicated hosts provide the flexibility to specify on which host to provision dedicated host instances, and these other benefits:\n\n\n\n* Control over which IBM Cloud data center the server is placed\n* Ability to manage your servers as workload requirements change; for example, migrate virtual servers between your dedicated hosts on the same POD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I keep my existing dedicated instances or do I need to set up a dedicated host and dedicated host instances? \n\nYes, you can keep your existing dedicated instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I interchange provisioning of dedicated instances (auto\u2013assigned) and dedicated host instances? \n\nNo. Existing auto-assigned dedicated instances cannot be reprovisioned on dedicated hosts. If you require virtual server placement, you need to provision them on dedicated hosts as dedicated host instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n What type of server, virtual or bare metal, supports the dedicated host offering? \n\nThe offering is supported on virtual servers; IBM Cloud does have a bare metal offering. The differences between virtual hosts and bare metal servers are the time to provision and virtualization management.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the provisioning lifecycle of a dedicated host? \n\nDedicated hosts are allocated to users when provisioned. They persist to the account until it is reclaimed. Dedicated hosts are offered in only on-demand pricing, hourly or monthly, so when reclaimed, billing models charge as either hourly or monthly IBM Cloud offerings.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is the dedicated host offering billed? \n\nYou can purchase dedicated hosts on-demand with hourly or monthly billing. Hourly only hosts allow only hourly instances to be provisioned; monthly only hosts allow provisioning of monthly and hourly instances. Pricing for dedicated hosts includes core, RAM, local SSD storage, and network port speeds. Premium operating systems, storage area network (SAN) storage, and software add-on prices and licensing are charged based on the instance deployed\u2014hourly or monthly\u2014on the dedicated host.

When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance. Instances are available on the x86 architecture. After you provision an instance, you control and manage those infrastructure resources.\n\n\n\n How are virtual server instances for VPC different from other IBM virtual server offerings? \n\nIn the IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for Classic infrastructure offering, instances use native subnet and VLAN networking to communicate to each other within a data center (and single pod). Using subnet and VLAN networking in one pod works well until you must scale up or have large virtual resource demands that require resources to be created between pods. (Adding appliances for VLAN spanning can get expensive and complicated!)\n\nIBM Cloud VPC adds a network orchestration layer that eliminates the pod boundary, creating increased capacity for scaling instances. The network orchestration layer handles all of the networking for all virtual server instances that are within a VPC across regions and zones. With the software-defined networking capabilities that VPC provides, you have more options for multi-vNIC instances and larger subnet sizes.\n\nTo review and start deploying compute resources, see the following topics:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Your assistant remembers this information, and other information about a conversation, as variables. Your assistant can use variables to provide a more personalized and customized experience, and to get users quickly to the solutions they need.\n\nVariables are a powerful tool that you can use to build a better assistant. Variables make possible all of the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* Personalization. The best virtual assistant experiences are targeted and personalized for each customer. When an assistant greets a customer by saying \"Hello, Frank! Welcome back,\" it tells Frank that it remembers his name and that it has talked to him before. By storing this kind of information in variables and then referencing them in your assistant's output, you can personalize the conversation and help your assistant seem more human.\n* Acceleration. Over the course of a conversation, your customers answer questions and make choices. These customer responses are stored as variables, which your assistant can then use to guide a conversation. By choosing the right steps and not wasting your customers' time, you can get them as quickly as possible to the right solution.\n* Modularity. Some information might be useful for many different purposes (for example, a customer's current account balance or contact information). Rather than retrieving or recalculating this information in multiple locations, you can do so once, by using a variable to store the result and then access it wherever you need it.\n\n\n\nA variable is simply a named container for a piece of information; by referencing this container by name, your assistant can store or retrieve the information at run time. For example, a variable that is called account_balance might store your customer's current account balance, a value your assistant can update or retrieve as needed.\n\nThe data that is stored by a variable is characterized by the type of data that it contains, such as text, a numeric value, a date, or even a list of multiple values. The operations that you can perform with a variable vary depending on its data type.\n\n\n\n Action variables and session variables \n\nWatson Assistant supports two categories of variables:\n\n\n\n* Action variables: When a step collects information from the customer, the customer response is automatically stored in an action variable.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02114-28721-30820","score":15.8096829528,"text":"\n--version-locator VERSION_NUMBER\n: To get the version locator for the product, run the ibmcloud catalog offering listcommand and locate the specified product or version you want to use.\n\n--output FORMAT (optional)\n: Specifies output format.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.11\/nodes\/pods\/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload. Priority classes can help you control the Red Hat OpenShift controller decisions to favor higher priority pods over lower priority pods. The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs). Access policies and SCCs can help prevent untrusted users from deploying high priority pods that prevent other pods from scheduling.\n\nHow does priority scheduling and preemption work?\n\nIn general, pending pods that have a higher priority are scheduled before lower prioritized pods. If you don't have enough resources remaining in your worker nodes, the Red Hat OpenShift controller can preempt (remove) pods to free up enough resources for the higher prioritized pods to be scheduled. Preemption is also affected by graceful termination periods, pod disruption budgets, and worker node affinity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-pod_priority"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Such words are referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The service adds OOV words to the custom model's words resource. The purpose of the words resource is to define words that are not already present in the service's vocabulary.\n\nDefinitions in the words resource tell the service how to transcribe the OOV words. The information includes a sounds_like field that tells the service how the word is pronounced, a display_as field that tells the service how to display the word, and a source field that indicates how the word was added to the custom model. For more information about the words resource and OOV words, see [The words resource](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-corporaWordswordsResource).\n\nAfter you add a grammar to a custom model, it is good practice to examine the OOV words in the model's words resource to verify their sounds-like pronunciations. Not all grammars have OOV words, but verifying the words resource is generally a good idea. To check the words of the custom model after you add a grammar, use the following methods:\n\n\n\n* Use the GET \/v1\/customizations\/{customization_id}\/words method to list all of the words from a custom model.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

In the following section, we see how IBM Cloudant is accessed programmatically.\n\nThe examples use Node.js, so if you want to try the code yourself, you need to install node and npm from nodejs.org.\n\nWe can then install the official IBM Cloudant Node.js library with npm install @cloudant\/cloudant. (Npm is the package manager that comes with Node.js - allowing you to access thousands of open source projects and build them into your application for free).\n\nOnce the IBM Cloudant library is installed, we can build some source code. Let's go through this code snippet line-by line:\n\nThe IBM Cloudant service URL is gleaned from the environment variable that we created earlier.\n\nThe @cloudant\/cloudant library is loaded into your Node.js app with the built-in required functions. We then create an instance of the library that is configured with the credentials we stored in the first line. We use the IBM Cloudant object to get a reference to the books database and store it in a variable database. We haven't made any API calls - only created data structures that store credentials and which database that we are working on. The main function calls db.list, which maps 1-1 with the _all_docs endpoint we saw earlier. The parameters passed to db.list must be familiar as the options that _all_docs expects to limit the result set and to return document bodies for each ID.\n\nSee another code snippet that writes a document.\n\nYou can see from the first line that standard JavaScript objects can be used in your code and sent to IBM Cloudant with no conversion, as they turn into JSON natively in JavaScript.\n\nWriting a document is simply a matter of calling db.insert, which maps to a PUT\/POST API call or to _bulk_docs.\n\nTo summarize, the official libraries for IBM Cloudant are Java\u2122, Python, and Nodejs. They are thin wrappers around the IBM Cloudant HTTP API - so it's worth understanding the underlying API to understand all the parameters.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11552-1740-3927","score":14.296088755,"text":"\nThe scripts include Ansible scripts for:\n\n\n\n* OS requirements installation and configuration for SAP applications\n* Cluster components installation\n* Ansible scripts for SAP application cluster configuration and SAP HANA cluster configuration\n* HANA installation\n* HANA DB backup\n* HANA system replica configuration\n* ASCS and ERS instances installation\n* DB load\n* Primary and extra application servers installation\n\n\n\nAnsible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.\n\n\n\n\n\n SAP Solution implemented \n\nSAP S\/4HANA is an ERP system from SAP's ERP software product line.

It is used to control processes and to link departments and functional areas in a meaningful way. Individual modules include applications for accounting, sales, production, and marketing. More complex tasks in customer or supply chain management can also be done by ERP software. As the successor to the core product SAP ECC, SAP S\/4HANA was presented as the intelligent ERP system of the new generation. Thanks to modern technologies, the Software as Service (SaaS) version is designed to help companies standardize processes and make the leap to digitalization.\n\nWhile previous SAP ERP solutions support the most common databases, SAP S\/4HANA uses exclusively the SAP HANA in-memory database developed by SAP. This in-memory database offers users the greatest technical benefit and they benefit from increased performance. The \"S\" in S\/4HANA stands for \"simple\", while the \"4\" refers to the generation sequence. Compared to the SAP core product SAP ECC, which is still used in most companies, SAP S\/4HANA offers many innovative functions that revolutionize the system landscape from the ground up.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":0.5,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":0.5,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6131471928,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6131471928}}

The problem might be an error in the Dockerfile itself, for example, a syntax error, or in the correctness of the operation that it performs. The problem can also be in your source code, which might fail to compile, for example, if Java\u00ae code is included.\n\nIf you successfully built your project locally, but the same source code does not build in Code Engine, then you might have files available locally that are not in your Git repository. For example, for Node.js projects, it is common to run the npm install command locally so that project dependencies are downloaded and placed in the node_modules directory inside the project directory. It is a good practice to include the node_modules directory in the [.gitignore file](https:\/\/git-scm.com\/docs\/gitignore) to keep your Git repository small. A common mistake is to forget to also run npm install (or npm ci) in the Dockerfile. A Docker build that you run locally can access the local node_modules directory, if you copy the whole project into the container, for example, by using the COPY . \/app command in the Dockerfile. But, the Code Engine build runs from a freshly checked-out Git repository and cannot access the node_modules directory. Therefore, you must run npm install (or npm ci) in the Dockerfile as part of the build.\n\nA good practice is to include directories like node_modules also in a [.dockerignore file](https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/engine\/reference\/builder\/dockerignore-file) so that the Docker build that you run locally behaves the same as the Code Engine build.\n\nAnother reason for a project to be successfully built locally but to fail as Code Engine build are security limitations. As with applications and batch jobs, Code Engine does not allow arbitrary system operations within the Code Engine cluster. Most of those system operations are not relevant for Docker builds anyway.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-ts-build-bldpush-stepfail"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07740-0-537","score":21.744715557,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  CP-7 (2) - Accessibility \n\n\n\n  Control requirements \n\nCP-7 (2) - 0\n:   The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n  NIST supplemental guidance \n\nArea-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such determinations made by organizations based on organizational assessments of risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-cp-7.2"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07737-0-851","score":21.7225323765,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  CP-6 (3) - Accessibility \n\n\n\n  Control requirements \n\nCP-6 (3) - 0\n:   The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n  NIST supplemental guidance \n\nArea-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such determinations made by organizations based on organizational assessments of risk.

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them.

If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

The trunk can connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or your company's on-premises private branch exchange (PBX).\n\nWhen a customer makes a phone call using the telephone number connected to your assistant, the phone integration makes it possible for your assistant to answer. The integration converts output from your assistant into voice audio by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service, and the audio is sent to the telephone network through the SIP trunk.

To connect your assistant to a new channel, go to the Integrations catalog. For more information about adding integrations to your assistant, see [Adding integrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-integration-add).\n\nAlthough a channel always exists in environments, you can configure your integration separately in each environment. For example, this allows you to test integrations on your draft environment before you go live with any integration configuration. After you add an integration, you must set it up to use it with your assistant. The Finish setup icon appears on any integration that you added but didn't yet set up.\n\nYou have multiple options for deploying your assistant, depending on how you want your customers to interact with it. In most cases, an assistant is deployed by using one of the following integrations:\n\n\n\n* [Web chat integration](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-web-chat): The web chat integration provides a secure and highly customizable widget you can add to your website.

Or, if you prefer, you can connect the assistant to your existing infrastructure by configuring an existing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk.\n\nA SIP trunk is equivalent to an analog telephone line, except it uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to transmit voice data and can support multiple concurrent calls. The trunk can connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or your company's on-premises private branch exchange (PBX). If you choose to generate a free phone number for your assistant, a SIP trunk is automatically provisioned from IntelePeer. You can also choose to use an existing SIP trunk from a provider such as IntelePeer, Genesys, or Twilio.\n\nGenerating a free phone number is available only with new phone integrations. If you have an existing phone integration and you want to switch to a free phone number, you must delete the existing integration and create a new one.\n\nWhen your customer makes a phone call using the telephone number connected to your assistant, the phone integration answers. The integration converts output from your assistant into voice audio by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service. The audio is sent to the telephone network through the SIP trunk. When the customer replies, the voice input is converted into text by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service.\n\nThis feature is available only to Plus or Enterprise plan users.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phone"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03158-21896-24017","score":24.8955192299,"text":"\nYou can use the same SIP account and phone number that you configured for use with Voice Agent with Watson in the phone integration.\n\nThe phone integration provides a more seamless integration with your assistant.

IBM pays a third-party provider for each sale of a product as follows:\n\n\n\n* As-a-service products: 87% of net revenue\n* Software products: 80% of net revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Can a third-party provider run activity reports and payout reconciliations? \n\nWe are adding features to support reports in the near future. Disbursements are based on the quantities that you submit to the usage metering service and the price that is defined when you set up your pricing plan in Partner Center. Third-party disbursements are calculated as a percentage of the net revenue for each product sold by IBM for a given calendar month. Net revenue is defined as the revenue recognized by IBM or an IBM affiliate calculated using applicable discounts, refunds, returns, offsets, and other adjustments determined in accordance with the current revenue recognition policies of IBM and its affiliates and the controlling accounting principles.

One application of reverse DNS is a spam filter. Typically, a spammer uses an invalid IP address that does not match the domain name. A reverse DNS lookup program inputs IP addresses of incoming messages to a DNS database. If no valid name is found to match the IP address, the server blocks the message. Reverse DNS is also used for things like network troubleshooting calls (such as ping) and for network monitoring tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Secondary domains \n\nA secondary domain is a domain that IBM Cloud DNS servers transfer from your server to our authoritative DNS servers, ns1.softlayer.com and ns2.softlayer.com.\n\nTo set up a secondary domain, you need three pieces of information: the domain, the IP address of the master DNS server we're transferring from and how often, in minutes, you'd like the domain transferred.\n\nAfter a secondary domain is configured, you'll have the ability to change the master server's IP address and the transfer interval.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06843-4238-6198","score":16.881097636,"text":"\nThis command returns either cc, cd, ci, or pr, depending on which pipeline is running.

If you create an IAM access policy that assigns User A to Secret Group A, and Secret Group A contains an [IAM credential](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials) with a service ID that gives access to Service A, then you grant User A access to Service A. In this scenario, Secret Group A becomes a gateway to Service A, even if a restriction exists in IAM. Keep in mind that with this scenario it is possible to grant access to a resource unintentionally. Review your configuration carefully to ensure that your secret group assignments do not override your IAM access policies accidentally.\n3. Audit your secret groups regularly and remove them when they're no longer needed.\n\nGrant only the minimum access that is required, and delete a secret group when it is no longer needed.\n\nTo delete a secret group, it must be empty. If you need to remove a secret group that contains secrets, you must first [delete the secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-delete-secrets) that are part of the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Track your related secrets by adding labels \n\nAdd labels so that you can further search by and categorize the secrets in your instance. When you use a consistent labeling schema, you can easily group similar secrets together.\n\n\n\n1. Label your secrets by using a consistent schema, such as creating labels to differentiate which secrets are used for a specific purpose. To add labels by using the Secrets Manager UI, go to the Secrets page, and then select a secret to edits its details.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":27.5699817071,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

For example:\n\nhttp.host eq \"www.example.com\" and ip.src in 92.182.212.0\/24\n\nIn this example, two single expressions comprise a compound expression. Think of each single expression as a condition. Each condition is evaluated individually before applying and logic to determine the final result of the compound expression.\n\nLooking at the first single expression, you can see that it contains:\n\n\n\n* a field - http.host\n* a comparison operator - eq\n* a value - \"www.example.com\"\n\n\n\nNot all conditions have the same structure.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with \/cdn-cgi\/challenge-platform\/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04170-1738-2974","score":22.866861271,"text":"\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

The Analytics feature relies on a microservice that is supported only on Red Hat OpenShift 4.5 and later.\n* CLU: A Conversational Language Understanding interface, also known as Natural Language Understanding (NLU), that is an entry point to the language understanding pipeline, which is where text is analyzed to find intent and entity mentions. The Store microservice uses the LiteLinks protocol to call this microservice to initiate machine learning training. The NLU microservice controls the lifecycle of the machine learning models. It maps the workspace ID that is used by the Store microservice to the machine language understanding pipeline's internal ID. The NLU microservice uploads the training data for machine learning models to the MinIO object storage. When a language model needs to be trained, such as after intents are edited, the NLU microservice calls the Master microservice. When the updated model is available, NLU calls the TAS microservice to analyze the user input that is provided by the customer. The workspace ID has a UUID format.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":22.4398749446,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":22.3383281177,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

You need to create identities you can use to sign transactions from your client applications.\n\n\n\nYou can use the console to create these identities by using the [registration process](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-identitiesibp-console-identities-register). After you register your admin identities, you need to issue each identity a signing certificate and private key, provide the signing certificate to your organization MSP definition, and add the identity to your console wallet. You can complete these steps for one admin identity when you [create your organization MSP](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizationsconsole-organizations-create-msp). You can use separate identities as org admins or node admins, or you can use one identity to do both tasks. The [Build a network tutorial](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-networkibp-console-build-network) uses one identity to be an admin for each organization created in the tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n Associating the identity of the CA admin \n\nBefore you can create identities, you need to associate the identity of the CA admin. Open your CA on the Nodes tab. If you are using the CA for the first time, you can click the Associate identity button to generate the CA admin identity and import it into your console wallet. On the Associate identity side panel, provide the Enroll ID and Enroll secret of the CA admin that you provided when you created the CA.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-identities"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03893-74275-75877","score":18.8816114122,"text":"\nConfigure an HSM client image[See Build a Docker image](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deploymentibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-build-docker).\n3.

This fee represents the charge for your blockchain component VPC allocation in your Kubernetes cluster.\n* IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: While you can link your IBM Blockchain Platform service instance to either an IBM Cloud Kubernetes service cluster or an OpenShift cluster, this pricing model is based on the usage of an IBM Cloud Kubernetes service cluster. The IBM Cloud Kubernetes service uses a tiered pricing model that is visible in IBM Cloud when you provision your paid cluster. This includes the charges for your compute, that is, CPU and memory. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Services are priced on a tiered model that is based on the number of hours of usage per month. Therefore, when you examine pricing plans, consider that 24x7 usage is equivalent to 720 hours per month. Refer to the table on the [Kubernetes Service Catalog page](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/kubernetes\/catalog\/about) for more details on cluster pricing. Customers who are interested in pricing OpenShift clusters can review [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Pricing](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/openshift\/pricing).\n* Storage: Choose the storage plan that works for your needs.

For more information, see [Emphasizing interjections](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-synthesis-expressiveemphasizing-interjections).\n\n\n\n\n\n Emphasizing words \n\nThe expressive voices use a conversational style that naturally applies the correct intonation from context. But you can indicate that one or more words are to be given more or less emphasis. The change in stress can be indicated by an increase or decrease in pitch, timing, volume, or other acoustic attributes. For more information, see [Emphasizing words](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-synthesis-expressiveemphasizing-words).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Customizing the service \n\nThe service includes a customization interface that you can use to create custom models for use during speech synthesis. A custom model is a dictionary of words and their translations for a specific language. Each word\/translation pair in a model tells the service how to pronounce a word when it occurs in input text.\n\nYou can use custom models to create application-specific translations for unusual words for which the service's regular pronunciation rules might yield imperfect pronunciations. For example, your application might routinely encounter domain-specific terms, special terms with foreign origins, personal or geographic names, or abbreviations and acronyms. By using customization, you can define translations that tell the service how you want such terms to be pronounced.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-service-features"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03249-21683-23216","score":16.4284118704,"text":"\nTo change what is saved, you must edit the value of the context variable.\n2.

In other words, the DataDictionary section that describes the names and types of fields that can appear in the input and output records that the model produces and consumes, the MiningSchema section that tells which named files defined in the DataDictionary section are in each tuple that represents a feature vector ,and the Output section that tells which named fields defined in the DataDictionary section are present in each tuple of the external representation of the output of the model. These functions must be table functions; each row in the table is passed to the PMML model and produce an output row.\n\nThis schema information is necessary because the PMML and AQL type systems do not match perfectly. For example, PMML has several types to represent timestamps, while AQL currently requires users to encode timestamps as string values. The schema information also allows developers who know AQL but not PMML to understand the AQL rule set.\n\nThe AQL compiler checks the input schema against the input schema of the PMML file to ensure that the two schemas are compatible. If the two schemas contain fields with the same name but incompatible types, compilation fails with an appropriate error message. If the function\u2019s input or output schemas contain extra or missing columns, the resulting function ignores these columns and does not generate an error.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05171-28090-29651","score":12.5188488707,"text":"\nThe example ends (leaving out most of the code for now) telling the app to listen on the port that is assigned and an environment property, or 3000 by default.

You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant. We could decide to add the \"address\" object only to the following documents:\n\n\n\n* Documents that are created from now on.\n* Only documents that we have addresses for.\n\n\n\nIn other words, documents of the same type can have fields present or missing.\n\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-7918-10060","score":10.6576225945,"text":"\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs.

In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier. You must definitely avoid patterns that rely on updating the same document over and over in a small time window.\n\n\n\nThat's the end of this part.

When you delete a root key that protects other DEKs, you ensure that the keys' associated data can no longer be accessed or decrypted. \n Delegated user access control By assigning Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, Hyper Protect Crypto Services supports a centralized access control system to enable granular access for your keys.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-envelope-encryption"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09081-7-2309","score":19.3648747914,"text":"\nProtecting data with envelope encryption \n\nKey Protect uses envelope encryption to assist in protecting your Key Protect data.

This topic describes the process of envelope encryption and how to use Key Protect to encrypt and decrypt your data.\n\nWhen working with sensitive data, it is important to use advanced encryption techniques to prevent a data breach. If you have large amounts of confidential data, it is often helpful to use a Key Management System to assist in keeping your data secure. Key Protect uses the envelope encryption technique to keep your data resilient. Envelope encryption is the process of using encrypted keys, Data Encryption Keys and Root Keys, to protect your sensitive data.\n\nImagine that you plan to send a letter to a colleague. You want to discuss information that is highly sensitive, so you generate a secret code (Data Encryption Key) that is used to write (encrypt) the message in the letter. The letter is delivered to a mailbox (wrapped Data Encryption Key) that can only be opened by those with a copy of the mailbox key (Root key), including the colleague. Anyone who does not have an exact copy of the key will be unable to open the mailbox and see it's contents. When your colleague uses the key to unlock (unencrypt) the mailbox, they will need to know the secret code that the letter is written in to be able to understand the message. Everyone who is not aware of the secret code will conclude that the letter is a random mix of characters and will not be able to understand the letter's contents.\n\nData encryption keys (DEKs) are designed to encrypt your data and can be generated and managed by your service or an IBM Cloud service.\n\nEnvelope encryption offers several benefits for protecting your data:\n\n\n\n* Protection under a combination of multiple algorithms Envelope encryption uses the best benefits from symmetric and public key algorithms to keep your keys secure.\n\n\n\n1.

Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois\/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs. CRKs that are not imported are created with 256-bit key material.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14378-13964-14975","score":18.2747363912,"text":"\nYou can allocate and mount more file shares across all hosts for your workloads at the time of purchase or later within the console.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

Billing stops automatically when the server is powered off. The suspend billing feature helps you reduce cost and prevents you from having to reprovision a virtual server when you need its resources again. Suspend billing does not apply to secondary public IP addresses and storage. A minimum 25% usage charge is applied to a powered off instance during its billing cycle.\n\nIf your profile doesn't support the suspend billing option or you choose not to suspend your instances, you are billed for your usage. The usage rate is based on the normal hourly or monthly rates for your instance configuration.\n\nMost virtual server instances that were created before 1 November 2018 and instances that are billed monthly don't support the suspend billing feature. To find out whether your virtual server instance supports the suspend billing feature, see [Viewing suspend billing feature](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-viewing-suspend-billing-feature).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nTo provision a virtual server instance that supports the suspend billing feature, the virtual server instance must be configured with the following settings:\n\n\n\n1. Hourly SAN\n2. Public profiles from one of the following families:\n\n\n\n* Balanced\n* Compute\n* Memory\n* Variable compute\n\n\n\n\n\nFor suspend billing to work properly, your instance must meet the preceding requirements and you must specify a profile.\n\nYou can use the suspend billing feature as a faster alternative to provisioning and reclaiming a virtual server instance.\n\nBilling is suspended only when you power off your virtual server instance through the IBM Cloud console, CLI, or SoftLayer API. If you power off your virtual server instance directly through the OS, billing isn't suspended for that instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Provisioning details \n\nYou can provision a virtual server instance that supports the suspend billing feature through the IBM Cloud catalog (cloud.ibm.com), CLI, or the SoftLayer API. You can't provision a virtual server instance that supports the suspend billing feature through the IBM Cloud infrastructure customer portal (control.softlayer.com).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-requirements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03749-8477-10695","score":20.4666948349,"text":"\nFor more information about managing your platform and support subscriptions, see [Managing subscriptions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage reporting \n\nEnterprises provide top-down usage reporting so that you can track the costs of resource usage from all accounts in the enterprise. Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team.\n\n\n\n* You give your financial officer access to view the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department.\n* You give each department lead access to view usage for everything in their department's account group.\n* You give each team lead access to view only the accounts in their team's account group.\n\n\n\nBecause access in the enterprise is separate from access in each account, enterprise users can't automatically manage resources within the child accounts. Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API. For more information, see [Viewing usage in an enterprise](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Invoicing and payments \n\nUsage in the enterprise is invoiced through the enterprise account. As with all billable accounts, usage is invoiced monthly, and the invoice is due on the billing date for your account. During each billing cycle, a single invoice with the usage costs from all accounts is made available in the enterprise account. The invoice contains costs for all platform and infrastructure usage as a single-line item in your invoice.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise&interface=ui"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04734-7-2373","score":20.4579205952,"text":"\nUnderstanding IaaS basics \n\nAs many organizations move to a cloud environment, either on-premises or hosted in data centers, the IT operations administrator's (IT ops admin) role is being redefined.

If the user whose identity is used by the subscription makes a change, their identity syncs automatically to affected clusters. If a user different from the subscription identity makes a change, the subscription identity cannot sync automatically.\n\nAs a result, sometimes the identities that are synced to each cluster might become incorrect.\n\n\n\n* If a different user or service ID modifies the subscription's cluster groups, the subscription's identity cannot automatically sync to any new clusters.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/satellite?topic=satellite-sat-sync-sub-identity"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03786-7-2105","score":17.1877889117,"text":"\nApplying subscription codes \n\nAfter you buy a subscription for platform or support credit, you must add the credit to your account by applying a subscription code to an existing account or a new account when you register.

Each promo code can be used one time and is valid only for a certain amount of time. Promo codes are provided on a limited basis by IBM Cloud sales to customers with billable accounts.\n\nPromo codes are typically based on short phrases, like PROMO200. If you have an alphanumeric code, such as a1b2c3def456, it's a different type of code that is referred to as a feature code. You can apply these codes on the Manage > Account > Account settings page or when you register for a new account. For more information, see [Applying feature codes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-codes).\n\nPromotions are one type of credit for your account. For example, if you have a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can use promo codes for limited-time credits toward your account and IBM Cloud products. Promo codes are different from feature codes that provide access to Trial accounts, or subscriptions that add credits as discounts to your account.\n\n\n\n Types of available promotion credits \n\nBoth one-time credit promotions and recurring dollar credit promotions are available for all IBM Cloud products.\n\n\n\n1. One-time credit promotion\n\n\n\n* Credit promotions can be used only one time, for a set time period, and you can't remove them after you apply them. Credit promotions use the following format: $X off for Y days.\n\n\n\n2. Recurring dollar credit promotion\n\n\n\n* Recurring dollar credits are offered for a set time period. For example, you can have a promotion of $100 USD value that is recurring every 30 days for 6 months. Recurring dollar credit promotions use the following format: $X every Y months, repeats Z times.\n* Promo credit expires at the end of the committed term. Any credit that isn't used doesn't roll over to the next term.\n\nWith a recurring credit, if the amount of credit that is allocated to a client is not used within the allocated time, the credit expires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying promo codes to your account","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-applying-promo-codes"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

For these interactions to be verifiable (to ensure, in other words, who is who) requires identities and a system of permissions that can be checked during each interaction. You can think of the kind of identity that is needed as being similar to a credit card in that it identifies someone within a particular context. Credit cards identify an individual in terms of banking transactions, while Fabric identities allow users to be identified in a blockchain context.\n\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, as well as the IBM Blockchain Platform, this component is the Certificate Authority (CA), which creates identities in the form of x509 certificates as well defining of an organization through the creation of a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines the permissions of identities at a component and channel level. These identities can include attributes about them, for example, by linking them to a particular organization or organizational unit (OU).\n\nAn organization MSP, for example, has an MSP subfolder called admins. Any user whose certificate is inside that admin folder is an admin of the organization. Because this MSP defines the organization, it is listed in the configuration on every channel of which the organization is a member. As a result, whenever an admin of the organization tries to perform an action, the signing certificate of the admin (which is attached to all of its interactions) is checked against the certificates listed in the MSP. Does the certificate match the one listed in the channel configuration? If it does, the other organizations will validate it and the action can be performed. If not, the request to execute the transaction is rejected.\n\nIBM Blockchain Platform CAs are based on the [Hyperledger Fabric CA](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-1.4\/), though it is possible to use another CA if it uses a PKI based on x.509 certificates. Because non-Fabric CAs are not configured to create properly formatted MSPs, users who want to use this kind of CA must create the MSP for themselves.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-blockchain-component-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09192-7-1931","score":32.4999930225,"text":"\nTroubleshooting \n\nGeneral problems with using IBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae might include providing the correct headers or credentials when you interact with the API.

Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

Please rephrase your question.\n>> I want to make an appointment.\nWhat day would you like to come in?\n>> Thursday\nI'm afraid I don't understand.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

You can use the \/dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid.

Before using the \/dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog.

However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.\n\n![Screen capture of the field in the node edit view where you add the node purpose summary.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/disambig-node-purpose.png)\n\nEvery dialog branch can be processed by the assistant while it chats with a customer, including branches with root nodes in folders.\n4. If a child node in any dialog branch conditions on a request or question that you do not want the assistant to handle, add a Connect to human agent response type to the child node.\n\nAt run time, if the conversation reaches this child node, the dialog is passed to a human agent at that point.\n\n\n\nYour dialog is now ready to support transfers from your assistant to a service desk agent.\n\nFor more information about different service desk solutions, see the following resources:\n\n\n\n* [Adding service desk support to the web chat](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-haa)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03113-6206-7586","score":18.1075293342,"text":"\n[Example dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/dialog_api_1.png)\n\nWe can create a new node by making a POST request to \/dialog_nodes with the following body:\n\n{\n\"dialog_node\": \"node_8\"\n}\n\nThe dialog now looks like this:\n\n![Example dialog 2](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/dialog_api_2.png)\n\nBecause node_8 was created without specifying a value for parent or previous_sibling, it is now the first node in the dialog.

Click Add response to add another response type to the current response.\n\nYou might want to add multiple response types to a single response to provide a richer answer to a user query. For example, if a user asks for store locations, you could show a map and display a button for each store location that the user can click to get address details. To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response.

The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant. For example, you might direct customers to your call center phone number or to an online support ticket form URL.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-11911-13556","score":17.981031003,"text":"\n[More icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/kebab.png) icon on the folder, and then select Add node to folder.\n\nThe dialog node is added to the end of the dialog tree within the folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deleting a folder \n\nYou can delete either a folder alone or the folder and all of the dialog nodes in it.\n\nTo delete a folder, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\nTo learn more about creating intents, watch the following 2 1\/2-minute video.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03405-4-2057","score":29.8235033105,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

The older vSRX 18.4 1G Standard offering is based on Linux Bridging and has different network configurations on the Ubuntu host, the KVM hypervisor, and in the vSRX configuration.

The new mechanism helps your skill to correctly recognize that the test utterances do not map to any of the intents defined in your training data, and classifies them as being Irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n How irrelevance detection works \n\nThe algorithmic models that help your assistant understand what your users say are built from two key pieces of information:\n\n\n\n* Subjects you want the assistant to address. For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16364-131984-133961","score":24.7695257689,"text":"\nAction: Remove references to @sys-person and @sys-location from your dialogs.

Click Add response to add another response type to the current response.\n\nYou might want to add multiple response types to a single response to provide a richer answer to a user query. For example, if a user asks for store locations, you could show a map and display a button for each store location that the user can click to get address details. To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response.

The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03118-1768-3298","score":28.2663369912,"text":"\n(Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy \/message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy \/message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

If PARTITIONED INTO is specified, the ORDER BY clause is ignored.\n\n\n\n Partition by columns \n\nWhen you use the PARTITIONED BY (column-list) clause without specifying INTO x BUCKETS\/OBJECTS, you can store the query result by using Hive-style partitioning, which is to create partitions that contain only rows that have certain values for one or more columns. Choose this physical layout if the stored object is further analyzed by using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.\n\nFor example, a result object that contains worldwide order data has a column country to represent the country that the order is initiated from. Partitioning the result object by the column PARTITIONED BY (country), would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.\n\nWhen the result object is stored this way on Cloud Object Storage, each SQL query that contains a predicate, such as country = 'USA' or country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY'), benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during SQL query execution partitions must be read only if they contain data for the countries of interest. This layout tremendously cuts down the I\/O traffic of the SQL query.\n\nSee the following extra remarks on Hive-style partitioning.\n\n\n\n* Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme because the column names that are used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, \/order\/COUNTRY=USA\/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet.\n* Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are stored in the object prefix of the partition. Thus, if you copy a HIVE-style partition and rename the object prefix by removing the partition column values, you lose data.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13480-4908-6825","score":17.3240714411,"text":"\nIncorrect column name specification results in an empty column, that is, the column seems to contain no data.

They\u2019ll help you prevent any issues with API or HTTPS traffic, and help your logs capture the correct IP addresses of your customers, rather than the protective CIS IP addresses.\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to set up:\n\n\n\n* Restore the originating IPs of your customers\n* Incorporate CIS IP addresses\n* Make sure your security settings don't interfere with API traffic\n* Configure your security settings as strictly as possible\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 1: Know how to restore the originating IPs of your customers \n\nAs a reverse proxy, CIS provides the origination IP in these headers:\n\n\n\n* CF-Connecting-IP\n* X-Forwarded-For\n* True-Client-IP (optional)\n\n\n\nYou can restore user IP addresses using a variety of tools, for infrastructures such as Apache, Windows IIS, and NGINX.\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: Incorporate CIS IP addresses to make integration smoother \n\nHere are the two steps to take:\n\n\n\n* Remove any rate limiting of CIS IP addresses\n* Set up your ACLs to allow only CIS IP addresses and other trusted parties\n\n\n\nYou can find the updated list of IP ranges for IBM CIS [at this location](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-allowlisted-ip-addresses).\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 3: Review your security settings to make sure they don\u2019t interfere with API traffic \n\nIBM CIS usually accelerates API traffic by removing connection overhead. However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00951-13787-15219","score":13.3323038531,"text":"\nThe clone, fork, and new types instruct the Git tool integration to create the target repo (repo_url) on the premise that this repo does not exist.

If you have a high percentage of re-validation requests, you could increase the TTLs of your content without negatively affecting your customers. By using the cache more effectively, you'll increase performance because you'll revalidate less often.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I tell if items are being cached? \n\nCIS adds the response header CF-Cache-Status when it attempts to cache an object. If caching is successful, the value of this header indicates its status with one of these keywords:\n\n\n\n* MISS: The asset was not yet in the cache or the TTL had expired (that is, it had reached the cache-control maximum age of 0).\n* HIT: The asset was delivered from the cache.\n* EXPIRED: This asset was delivered from cache, but the next request requires revalidation.\n* REVALIDATED: The asset was delivered from cache.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy.

This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07163-5129-7116","score":21.2698054989,"text":"\nWe recommend that you apply both available ratings to your results: Relevant and Not relevant.

It is not mandatory to apply a relevance score of 0 when you train your documents, but if you apply a relevance score of 0 to certain documents, relevancy training marks those documents as non-relevant examples, instead of treating them as a random sample of results from the query.\n* The training queries must include some term overlap between the query and the desired answer so it can be retrieved by the Discovery service's initial search, which is broad in scope.\n\n\n\nWatson uses training data to learn patterns and to generalize, not to memorize individual training queries.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it. To test whether your fixes address the issue, you can convert the original file to a PDF file to check for unexpected carriage returns in the text.\n\nAfter applying a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model to a PPT file, table boundaries are not recognized properly\n: During the conversion process, text that is extracted from the table is confused with text that is outside the table in some PPT pages.

Customizing how your documents are indexed into Discovery improves the answers that your application returns.\n\nWith SDU, you annotate fields within your documents to train custom conversion models. As you annotate, Watson is learning and starts to predict annotations. SDU models can be exported and used on other collections.\n\nThis documentation applies to Discovery service instances that you create with a Lite or an Advanced plan, or that you created with a Premium plan before 16 July 2020. For more information about features in Premium plan instances created on or after 16 July 2020, and in Plus (including Plus Trial) plan instances, see [these docs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-configuring-fields).\n\n\n\n Supported document types and browsers \n\nSupported document types for Smart Document Understanding:\n\n\n\n* Lite plans: PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, JSON*, HTML*\n* Advanced plans: PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, PNG**, TIFF**, JPG**, JSON*, HTML*\n\n\n\n* JSON and HTML documents are supported by IBM Watson\u2122 Discovery, but can not be edited using the SDU editor. To change the configuration of HTML and JSON docs, you need to use the API. For more information, see the [API reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/discovery\/).\n\n** Individual image files (PNG, TIFF, JPG) are scanned and the text (if any) is extracted. PNG, TIFF, and JPEG images embedded in PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files are also scanned and the text, if any, is extracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using the Smart Document Understanding editor \n\nThe SDU editor is only available for collections that contain supported document types and do not have the Element Classification enrichment applied.

Each collection adds documents from a single data source. When they are built together into a single project, a user can search across both sources at the same time.\n* Applying enrichments\n\nCreating a collection is a good way to group documents that you want to enrich in a similar way. For example, maybe a subset of your documents contains industry jargon and you want to add a dictionary that recognizes the terms. You can create a separate collection and apply the Parts of Speech enrichment so you can use the term suggestions feature to speed up the process of creating the dictionary.\n* Creating separate Smart Document Understanding (SDU) models\n\nYou can use the Smart Document Understanding tool to identify content based on the structure of a document. If you have 20 PDF files that were created by your Sales department and use one template and 20 PDF files that were created by your Research department and use a different template, group each set into its own collection. You can then use the SDU tool to build a model for each structure separately, a model that understands the unique structure. You can also use the tool to define custom fields that are unique to the source documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a collection \n\nBefore you can create a collection, you must create a project. For more information, see [Creating projects](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-projects).\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n\n\n* A collection can support only one external data source.\n* Documents in the collection must be in one language only, the language that you specify for the collection.\n\n\n\nTo create a collection, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Open a project, go to the Manage collections page, and then click New collection.\n\n\n\n* The Conversational Search, Document Retrieval, and Custom project types can contain up to 5 collections.\n* A Content Mining project can contain only 1 collection.\n\n\n\n2.

Now the model is immutable. To add an order, I create a new order document in the database, which cannot generate conflicts.\n\nTo be able to retrieve all orders for a specific customer, we can employ a view, which we cover later.\n\nAvoid constructs that rely on updates to parts of existing documents, where possible. Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00620-9537-11012","score":27.0284542605,"text":"\nHowever, in a real application, the page size might be different and depends on document size, latency demands, memory consumption, and other tradeoffs.You can use the options that are described in the following sections.<-- <section \"id=\"section-option-1-fetch-one-doc-too-many\" \"> --> Option 1 - Fetch one document too many Instead of fetching five documents (limit=5), fetch 5+1 (limit=6), but hide the sixth document from your users.

If it finds a term that it can match to an existing dictionary entity value or synonym, it adds the term to the list of words that belong to the skill, and does not correct it.\n\nFor example, if a user enters a sentence like I wnt to buy a boook, fuzzy matching recognizes that the term boook means the same thing as your entity value book, and adds it to the protected words list. Your assistant corrects the input to be, I want to buy a boook. Notice that it corrects wnt but does not correct the spelling of boook. If you see this type of result when you are testing your dialog, you might think your assistant is misbehaving. However, your assistant is not. Thanks to fuzzy matching, it correctly identifies boook as a @reading_material entity mention. And thanks to autocorrection revising the term to want, your assistant is able to map the input to your buy_something intent. Each feature does its part to help your assistant understand the meaning of the user input.\n\n\n\n\n\n How autocorrection works \n\nNormally, user input is saved as-is in the text field of the input object of the message. If, and only if the user input is corrected in some way, a new field is created in the input object, called original_text. This field stores the user's original input that includes any misspelled words in it. And the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected.

This means that if the user's input was automatically corrected, show the corresponding response.

However, because the user's input includes the word tomorrow and the reservation node with slots is being processed, your assistant assumes the user is providing or updating the reservation date instead. The current node always gets priority. If you define a clear confirmation statement, such as, Ok, setting the reservation date to tomorrow, the user is more likely to realize there was a miscommunication and correct it.\n\nConversely, while filling slots, if the user provides a value that is not expected by any of the slots, there is a chance it will match against a completely unrelated root node that the user never intended to digress to.\n\nBe sure to do lots of testing as you configure the digression behavior.\n* When to use digressions instead of slot handlers: For general questions that users might ask at any time, use a root node that allows digressions into it, processes the input, and then goes back to the flow that was in progress. For nodes with slots, try to anticipate the types of related questions users might want to ask while filling in the slots, and address them by adding handlers to the node.\n\nFor example, if the node with slots collects the information required to fill out an insurance claim, then you might want to add handlers that address common questions about insurance. However, for questions about how to get help, or your stores locations, or the history of your company, use a root level node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disambiguation \n\nWhen you enable disambiguation, you instruct your assistant to ask users for help when it finds that more than one dialog node can respond to their input.

The service offers several predefined libraries that are designed to help meet compliance for a specific use case. Each control has several specifications and assessments that are mapped to it. A specification is a defined requirement that is specific to a component. When met by an organization, the specification helps to ensure that they are compliant with the control. An assessment, or several, are mapped to each specification with a detailed evaluation that is done to check whether the specification is compliant.

The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the Skills page, click Create skill.\n2. Name your skill, and optionally add a description. From the Language field, choose Another language.\n\nRemember, if the language you want to support is listed individually, choose it instead of using the universal model. The built-in language models provide optimal language support.\n3. Create the skill.\n4. If your skill will support a language with right-to-left directional text, such as Hebrew, configure the bidirectional capabilities.\n\nClick the options icon from the skill tile ![Skill options icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/kebab.png), and then select Language preferences.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03353-4-2000","score":32.0817233856,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Adding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03118-4-2208","score":31.2930539865,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy \/message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill. The v1 runtime API is supported primarily for backward compatibility purposes.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03118-1768-3298","score":31.0551660343,"text":"\n(Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy \/message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill. The v1 runtime API is supported primarily for backward compatibility purposes. If you use the v1 \/message method, you must implement your own state management, and you cannot take advantage of versioning or any of the other features of an assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Authoring applications \n\nThe v1 API provides methods that enable an application to create or modify dialog skills, as an alternative to building a skill graphically using the Watson Assistant user interface. An authoring application uses the API to create and modify skills, intents, entities, dialog nodes, and other artifacts that make up a dialog skill. For more information, see the [v1 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v1).\n\nNote: The v1 authoring methods create and modify workspaces rather than skills. A workspace is a container for the dialog and training data (such as intents and entities) within a dialog skill. If you create a new workspace using the API, it will appear as a new dialog skill in the Watson Assistant user interface.\n\nFor a list of the available API methods, see [API methods summary](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-methods).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03330-3253-5192","score":30.7277871998,"text":"\n* A conversational skill interprets the customer's message further, then directs the flow of the conversation.

This API offers significant advantages over the v1 runtime API, including automatic state management, ease of deployment, skill versioning, and the availability of new features such as the search skill.\n\nThe v2 API is available for all users, regardless of service plan, at no additional cost.\n\nThe v2 API currently supports only runtime interaction with an existing assistant. Authoring applications that create or modify workspaces should continue to use the v1 API.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nWith the v2 API, your client app communicates with an assistant, rather than directly with a workspace. An assistant is a new orchestration layer that offers several new capabilities, including automatic state management, skill versioning, easier deployment, and (for Plus and Premium plans) search skills. Your existing workspace (now referred to as a dialog skill) continues to function as before, but the new capabilities are provided by the new assistant layer.\n\nAll communication with an assistant takes place within the context of a session, which maintains conversation state throughout the duration of the conversation. State data, including any context variables that are defined by your dialog or client application, are automatically stored by Watson Assistant, without any action required on the part of your application.\n\nState data persists until you explicitly delete the session, or until the session times out because of inactivity.\n\nIf you prefer to manage state yourself, the v2 API also provides a stateless message method that functions more like the v1 API. If you use the stateless message method, you do not need to explicitly create or delete sessions, and your app is responsible for maintaining context.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-migration"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.2,"recall_5":0.2,"recall_10":0.2,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.234639363,"ndcg_cut_5":0.1695801026,"ndcg_cut_10":0.1695801026}}

Instead of adding those topics as counterexamples which can be hard to find later, capture the customer input examples as new intents. But don't link dialog nodes to the intents until you're ready. If customers ask about one of these topics in the meantime, the anything_else node is triggered to explain that the assistant can't help with the current request, but can help them with other things.\n\n\n\n Irrelevance detection \n\nThe irrelevance detection feature helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore.

You successfully created an assistant that can answer questions about Discovery by retrieving information from the product documentation by way of the NeuralSeek service.\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIn this tutorial, you created a Watson Discovery Document Retrieval project with uploaded PDF files that contain the Discovery product documentation. Separately, you created a Watson Assistant virtual assistant with a single action that can recognize user questions about Discovery. You added a custom extension to your assistant that connects to a third-party service called NeuralSeek that gets the correct answer from Discovery and rewords the response. Finally, you tested your virtual assistant by asking a question and getting an accurate and well-written response.\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\nThe assistant that you created is available from the draft environment. Next, you can publish your assistant to a production environment and deploy it. You can deploy the assistant in various ways.

The irrelevance detection model helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore. This enhanced model helps your skill recognize irrelevant inputs earlier in the development process.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of the new algorithm, read the [Why Zero-Effort Irrelevance is Relevant](https:\/\/medium.com\/ibm-watson\/enhanced-offtopic-90b2dadf0ef1) blog post.\n\nThe new algorithm is enabled automatically for any English-language skills that you import or create.\n\nTo test the new detection mechanism in the Try it out pane, submit one or more utterances that have absolutely nothing to do with your training data. The new mechanism helps your skill to correctly recognize that the test utterances do not map to any of the intents defined in your training data, and classifies them as being Irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n How irrelevance detection works \n\nThe algorithmic models that help your assistant understand what your users say are built from two key pieces of information:\n\n\n\n* Subjects you want the assistant to address. For example, questions about order shipments for an assistant that manages product orders.\n\nYou teach your assistant about these subjects by defining intents and providing lots of sample user utterances that articulate the intents so your assistant can recognize these and similar requests as examples of input for it to handle.\n* Subjects you want the assistant to ignore. For example, questions about politics for an assistant that makes pet grooming appointments exclusively.\n\nYou teach your assistant about subjects to ignore by marking utterances that discuss subjects which are out of scope for your application as being irrelevant. Such utterances become counterexamples for the model.\n\n\n\nThe best way to build an assistant that understands your domain and the specific needs of your customers is to take the time to build good training data, especially data that includes counterexamples.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-irrelevance-detection"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03405-4-2057","score":28.5431733308,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

Known issues and limitations that apply to the Secrets Manager service\n\n Issue Workaround \n\n Multiple secrets of the same type can't be created with the same name. It is not possible to create more than one secret of the same type with the same name. This limitation applies at the instance level. To organize similar secrets of the same type across multiple secret groups in your instance, try adding a prefix or suffix to the names of those secrets. \n Secrets can't be transferred between secret groups. If you accidentally assign a secret to the wrong secret group, or if you don't want a secret to belong to the default secret group, you must delete the secret and create a new one. \n API keys that are associated with an IAM secret aren't valid immediately after they are generated. If you have automation in place that calls the Secrets Manager API to get the API key for an IAM secret, add a wait delay of 2 seconds to allow the new API key to be recognized by IAM. \n IAM credentials with a time-to-live (TTL) don't immediately expire. After a secret with a TTL reaches the end of its lease duration, expect a tolerance of 1 - 2 minutes before the secret's associated service ID is deleted by IAM. \n Certificates that you order from Let's Encrypt can't have a Common Name (CN) that exceeds 64 characters in length. As a workaround, during the certificate order process, you can configure a shorter domain name so that it can be used as the certificate CN in your DNS provider. Then, you can order a multi-domain SAN certificate that uses the same shortened domain as the CN, along with longer application domains that are specified as Subject Alternative Names (SANs). \n Users that have Writer or Manager service access that is scoped to secret groups are unable to create some types of secrets when they use the Secrets Manager UI.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-known-issues-and-limits"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06160-10037-11653","score":16.7351254249,"text":"\nIf your worker nodes switch between a Normal and Critical or NotReady state, check the following components for any issues or recent changes that may disrupt your worker nodes.\n\n\n\n1.

The load balancer defines which origin server pools to use, the order in which they are used, and how to geographically distribute traffic among pools.\n\nWhen you create a load balancer on CIS, you can do one of the following:\n\n\n\n*  Use a unique hostname with no existing DNS record\n*  Use a hostname that has an existing DNS record (an A, AAAA, or CNAME record)\n\n\n\nIf a hostname has an existing DNS record, the load balancer supersedes the DNS record if the DNS record is an A, AAAA, or canonical name (CNAME) record. It does not supersede other record types.\n\nIf the load balancer is disabled, preexisting DNS records are served.\n\nIf there is no preexisting DNS record with the same name, disabling the load balancer prevents clients from resolving the host, and requests fail.\n\nIf a load balancer is manually disabled, traffic is not served to the associated origins or the fallback. If all pools in a load balancer are manually disabled, the fallback origin is used unless the fallback is also disabled. If the fallback is also disabled, the SOA record is served. Otherwise, if there is one pool in the load balancer and the pool is unhealthy, CIS sends traffic to the fallback pool regardless of the fallback pool's health.\n\n\n\n  HTTP keep-alive (persistent HTTP connection) \n\nCIS maintains keep-alive connections to improve performance and to reduce the cost of recurring TCP connects in the request transaction as CIS proxies customer traffic from its edge network to the site's origin.\n\nEnsure that HTTP keep-alive connections are enabled on your origin. CIS reuses open TCP connections for up to 15 minutes (900 seconds) after the last HTTP request. Origin web servers close TCP connections if too many are open.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16242-7-2224","score":23.325015945,"text":"\nResponse modes \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nYou can choose a response mode for each action to set how it behaves. The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14311-2669-4435","score":23.1209545321,"text":"\nIf you use the existing workload edge cluster, you must create the edge bridge profile by using that cluster and change the existing-distributed port group to allow Promiscuous mode and Forged transmits.

You're looking to your cloud providers to offer hardware monitoring and security controls that can determine whether a workload is running on trusted hardware in a known location. IBM Cloud\u00ae is leading the way to help you deploy hybrid and cloud environments with enhanced security verification of your launch environment by using Intel\u00ae Trusted Execution Technology (Intel TXT).\n\n\n\n How Intel TXT works \n\nIntel TXT provides hardware monitoring and security controls that help assure businesses that a workload that is deployed on or migrated to the IBM Cloud infrastructure is running on trusted hardware in a known location. IBM Cloud supports Intel TXT on a range of Bare Metal Servers. See [Intel\u00ae Trusted Execution Technology](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/bare-metal-servers\/intel-txt) for a complete list.\n\nIntel TXT analyzes and measures the components of a computing system from the operating system or hypervisor to the computing system\u2019s boot firmware and hardware. The analysis includes the system\u2019s basic input\/output system (BIOS), main boot record (MBR), and boot loader. The measurements are compared to a standard baseline to determine whether the system is trusted or untrusted. System software and local or remote management software can use the trust decision to allow or deny a workload from running on that a computing system. Since Intel\u00ae TXT performs the analysis and measuring during boot up, the added security doesn\u2019t add any increased processor usage to applications.\n\nThe baseline measurements are stored on a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware device. The TPM device is integrated within the server system and provides a range of Intel TXT security-related functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does Intel TXT does for you \n\nIntel TXT is especially advantageous for large enterprises subject to compliance and audit regulations, such as healthcare, financial services, and government organizations. It helps assure that tracking of all trusted resources can be integrated, managed, and reported on with the relevant compliance organizations (HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP, ISO, FISMA, and SSAE 16).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-hardware-monitroing-security-controls"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05608-1309-3624","score":14.9645023386,"text":"\nAs a security administrator or auditor, you might want to compare your company's internal standards and external regulatory requirements with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

To obtain ground truth, you will want to spend time training and educating human annotators so that they can make the best judgments when analyzing domain content.\n\n\n\n Inter-annotator agreement \n\nAfter human annotators have annotated the documents, you must determine which documents to promote to ground truth. Start by reviewing the inter-annotator agreement scores. Documents with low scores are candidates to be rejected and returned to the human annotator for improvement.\n\nWhen calculating inter-annotator agreement scores, the system examines all overlapping documents in all annotation sets in the task, regardless of the status of the sets.

To choose the best documents, follow these guidelines:\n\n\n\n* Strive to provide a set of documents that have a total size of about 300,000 words. Provide more words for a complex type system, and fewer for a simpler one.\n* Limit each document to a page or two of content (fewer than 2,000 words, and closer to 1,000 words per document is best). In the early stages of model development, keeping each document down to a few paragraphs is also a good practice. A human annotator can mark mentions and relations in a long document, but attempts to mark coreferences across multiple pages might prove unwieldy.\n* Ensure that the data in the documents is distributed across all possible entity types, subtypes, and roles, and the relationships between them. A goal to aim for is to eventually have at least 50 annotations for each entity type and 50 for each relation type in the document collection.\n* Again, documents should represent the breadth of the subject matter that the application will cover, but in the case of skewed frequency-of-occurrence of entity types and relation types, try to get at least 50 exemplars of each type, more for entity types that have mentions which tend to be phrases.\n* The set that you create for training must contain at least 10 annotated documents.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-documents-for-annotation"}],"retriever_scores":{}}

The human annotator annotates the documents in the annotation set. To later use inter-annotator scores to compare the annotations that are added by each human annotator, you must assign at least two human annotators to different annotation sets. You must also specify that some percentage of documents overlap between the sets.\n\nIn a realistic scenario, you create as many annotation sets as needed, based on the number of human annotators who are working in the workspace. In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

If it finds a term that it can match to an existing dictionary entity value or synonym, it adds the term to the list of words that belong to the skill, and does not correct it.\n\nFor example, if a user enters a sentence like I wnt to buy a boook, fuzzy matching recognizes that the term boook means the same thing as your entity value book, and adds it to the protected words list. Your assistant corrects the input to be, I want to buy a boook. Notice that it corrects wnt but does not correct the spelling of boook. If you see this type of result when you are testing your dialog, you might think your assistant is misbehaving. However, your assistant is not. Thanks to fuzzy matching, it correctly identifies boook as a @reading_material entity mention.

Each feature does its part to help your assistant understand the meaning of the user input.\n\n\n\n\n\n How autocorrection works \n\nNormally, user input is saved as-is in the text field of the input object of the message.

If you define a clear confirmation statement, such as, Ok, setting the reservation date to tomorrow, the user is more likely to realize there was a miscommunication and correct it.\n\nConversely, while filling slots, if the user provides a value that is not expected by any of the slots, there is a chance it will match against a completely unrelated root node that the user never intended to digress to.\n\nBe sure to do lots of testing as you configure the digression behavior.\n* When to use digressions instead of slot handlers: For general questions that users might ask at any time, use a root node that allows digressions into it, processes the input, and then goes back to the flow that was in progress. For nodes with slots, try to anticipate the types of related questions users might want to ask while filling in the slots, and address them by adding handlers to the node.\n\nFor example, if the node with slots collects the information required to fill out an insurance claim, then you might want to add handlers that address common questions about insurance. However, for questions about how to get help, or your stores locations, or the history of your company, use a root level node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disambiguation \n\nWhen you enable disambiguation, you instruct your assistant to ask users for help when it finds that more than one dialog node can respond to their input.

The input generated by the first choice is submitted and recorded as part of the conversation. However, any contextual information that is generated by the initial suggestion is reset when the subsequent suggestion is submitted.\n\nThe suggestions are shown automatically in situations where the customer might otherwise become frustrated. For example, if a customer uses different wording to ask the same question multiple times in succession, and the same action is triggered each time, then related topic suggestions are shown in addition to the triggered action's response. The suggestions that are offered give the customer a quick way to get the conversation back on track.\n\nThe suggestions list is populated with actions that are relevant in some way to the matched action. The actions are ones that the AI model considered to be possible alternatives, but that didn't meet the high confidence threshold that is required for an action to be listed as a disambiguation option. Any action can be shown as a suggestion, unless its Ask clarifying question setting is set to Off. For more information about the Ask clarifying question setting, see [Asking clarifying questions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questionsunderstand-questions-ask-clarifying-question).\n\nTo configure suggestions, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16468-14825-17168","score":29.8836829314,"text":"\nTo connect the ground truth editor and adjudication tool to your annotation guidelines:\n\n\n\n1. Log in as a Knowledge Studio administrator, and select your workspace.\n2. select the Settings > Annotation Guidelines tab.\n3. Specify the URL to where your guidelines are hosted.\n4. Click Save. The system connects the ground truth editor and adjudication tool to your annotation guidelines. Depending on the access permissions granted to users when you created the guidelines, human annotators and workspace administrators might be able to update the guidelines after opening them, for example, to add clarifications and examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotation guidelines \n\nThere is no prescribed format for how to document the guidelines, but it is important that the guidelines include detailed examples. Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced. Changes that you make in one area must be evaluated and coordinated with changes that you make in another area.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotate-documents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16468-22044-24033","score":29.7304561739,"text":"\nInclude specific road adjectives likely to be relevant to the configuration of an accident; omit other adjectives.

During an update or reload, your worker node machine is reimaged, and data is deleted if not [stored outside the worker node](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-storage-plan).\n* Master patches: Master patches are applied automatically over the course of several days, so a master patch version might show up as available before it is applied to your master. The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, as noted in the change log, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings.

Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

Instead of guessing which action to take, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer, and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nZoom\n\n![Shows a sample conversation between a user and the assistant, where the assistant asks for clarification from the user.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718\/watson-assistant\/images\/disambig-demo.png)\n\nSample conversation\n\nAny Created by you action that might match the customer's input can be included in the choices that are listed by a clarifying question. The Set by assistant actions are never included.\n\nIn the assistant output, the possible actions are listed by name. The default name for an action is the text of the first example message that you add to it (such as I want to open an account), but you can change this name to something more descriptive.\n\nThe order in which the actions are listed might change. In fact, the actions themselves that are included in the list might change. This behavior is intended. As part of development that is in progress to help the assistant learn automatically from user choices, the actions that are included and their order in the list is randomized on purpose. Randomizing the order helps to prevent bias that can be introduced by a percentage of people who always pick the first option without carefully reviewing all of their choices beforehand.\n\n\n\n Customizing clarifying questions \n\nTo customize clarification, you can:\n\n\n\n* Change settings like the wording your assistant uses to introduce the clarification list or when no action matches.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questions"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16359-9997-12076","score":24.7583525798,"text":"\nSet the Enable disambiguation switch to Off.\n4.

The effect of this choice depends on the confidence score for the action that you exclude.\n\nIf the action has the highest confidence score for a customer's question, no clarifying question is asked, and the action is triggered.\n\nIf the action doesn't have the highest confidence score, the action is excluded from the list of choices in the clarifying question.\n\nFor more information about confidence scores, see [Confidence scoring](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questionsunderstand-questions-confidence-scoring).\n\nTo exclude an action from clarification:\n\n\n\n1.

It's important to distinguish how each action is triggered. When a user enters a question or request, the phrase is evaluated across all the Customer starts with examples in every action. If two actions have similar phrase examples, then the wrong action might get triggered by your user's question.\n\n\n\n Confidence scoring \n\nBehind the scenes, Watson Assistant determines a confidence score for each phrase. The score is absolute, meaning that a confidence score is assigned based on a predetermined scale, and not relative to other customer phrases. This approach adds flexibility in case multiple questions or requests are detected in a single user input.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questions"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16299-7-2120","score":26.350709839,"text":"\nOverview: Customizing and developing \n\nThe Watson Assistant user interface makes it easy to build an assistant and deploy it to your customers without writing any code.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03166-4-2012","score":35.2221723841,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

To see all documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Accessing context data \n\nThe context is an object containing variables that persist throughout a conversation and can be shared by the dialog and the client application. Both the dialog and the client application can read and write context variables.\n\nYou can choose whether you want the context to be maintained by your application or by the Watson Assistant service:\n\n\n\n* If you use the stateful v2 message API, the context is automatically maintained by the assistant on a per-session basis. Your application must explicitly create a session at the beginning of each conversation; the context is stored by the service as part of the session and is not returned in message responses unless you request it. For more information, see the [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2message).\n* If you use the stateless v2 message API (or the legacy v1 message API) your application is responsible for storing the context after each conversation turn and sending it back to the service with the next message. For a complex application, or an application that needs to store personally identifiable information, you might choose to store the context in a database.\n\nA session ID is automatically generated at the beginning of the conversation, but no session data is stored by the service. With the stateless message API, the context is always included with each message response. For more information, see the [v2 API Reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2messagestateless).\n\n\n\nImportant: One use of the context is to specify a unique user ID for each end user who interacts with the assistant.

Personal Data is not supported for those methods.\n\nIMPORTANT: Specifying a customer_id will delete all messages with that customer_id that were received before the delete request, across your entire Watson Assistant instance, not just within one skill.\n\nAs an example, to delete any message data associated with a user that has the customer ID abc from your Watson Assistant instance, send the following cURL command:\n\ncurl -X DELETE -u \"apikey:3Df... ...Y7Pc9\" \"{url}\/v2\/user_data?customer_id=abc&version=2020-04-01\"\n\nwhere {url} is the appropriate URL for your instance.

(For more information about dialog responses, see [Responses](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-responses)).\n\n\n\n Response output format \n\nBy default, responses from a dialog node are specified in the output.generic object in the response JSON returned from the \/message API. The generic object contains an array of up to 5 response elements that are intended for any channel. The following JSON example shows a response that includes text and an image:\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n{\n\"response_type\": \"text\",\n\"text\": \"OK, here's a picture of a dog.\"\n},\n{\n\"response_type\": \"image\",\n\"source\": \"http:\/\/example.com\/dog.jpg\"\n}\n],\n\"text\" : [\"OK, here's a picture of a dog.\"]\n},\n\"user_id\": \"faf4a112-f09f-4a95-a0be-43c496e6ac9a\"\n}\nShow more\n\nAs this example shows, the text response (OK, here's a picture of a dog.) is also returned in the output.text array. This is included for backward compatibility for older applications that do not support the output.generic format.\n\nIt is the reponsibility of your client application to handle all response types appropriately. In this case, your application would need to display the specified text and image to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n Response types","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-responses"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16382-7-1870","score":17.3621688546,"text":"\nManaging user identity information \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nIf you do not pass an identifier for the user when the session begins, the web chat creates one for you. It creates a first-party cookie with a generated anonymous ID. The cookie remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site later in the month and chats with your assistant again, the web chat integration recognizes the user. And you are charged only once when the same anonymous user interacts with your assistant multiple times in a single month.\n\nIf you want to perform tasks where you need to know the user who submitted the input, then you must pass the user ID to the web chat integration. Choose a non-human-identifiable ID. For example, do not use a person's email address as the user ID.\n\nIn addition, the ability to delete any data created by someone who requests to be forgotten requires that a customer_id be associated with the user input. When a user_id is defined, the product can reuse it to pass a customer_id parameter.

Discovery v2 offers significant advantages over Discovery v1.\n\nLearn about how to migrate a v1 Discovery service instance to Discovery v2, including how to move data and update your applications.\n\nThe major structural differences between Discovery v1 and v2 include:\n\n\n\n* There is no concept of an environment in v2. The deployment details such as size and index capacity are managed for you when you choose the appropriate service plan for your needs. For managed deployments, you can choose a Plus, Enterprise, or Premium plan, for example. For installed deployments, the sizing is managed by the deployment type that you specify when you install the service in Cloud Pak for Data.\n* There is no single configuration object in v2. Control of the enrichments that are applied to documents is managed in the collections and project objects in v2. Other v1 configuration capabilities, such as the ability to customize the conversion step of ingestion, are not available in v2.\n* Greater programmatic support is available for custom enrichments in v2. New enrichment API methods are available that you can use to create enrichments. v2 also introduces document classifier API methods that you can use to train document classifier models programmatically. You can apply these custom enrichments to a collection by using the API.\n* The capabilities of a natural language query search are expanded in v2 to enable the return of the top passages per document and of succinct answers from passages. Other advanced search capabilities are introduced, including table retrieval. In v2, the deduplication parameter is not available and the continuous relevancy training and query logging functions are not available.\n* For more information about feature differences, see [the feature comparison table](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-version-chooseversion-choose-comparison).\n* For more information about detailed API differences, see [API version comparison](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-migrate-to-v2-api).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-migrate-to-v2"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16034-7-1778","score":16.8156480091,"text":"\nVPC CLI release notes \n\nThe following release notes are for the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) command line interface (CLI).\n\n\n\n v6.15.0 \n\nVersion 6.15.0 was released on 2023-07-11.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* New commands image-obsolete and image-deprecate are introduced to support image lifecycle management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for image lifecycle management in image-create, image-update, and images commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.14.1 \n\nVersion 6.14.1 was released on 2023-06-30.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* Fixed issue with using the SSH key generated from UI in CLI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.14.0 \n\nVersion 6.14.0 was released on 2023-06-23.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for more algorithms in the SSH key key-create command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.13.0 \n\nVersion 6.13.0 was released on 2023-06-22.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for snapshot and backup cross region copy in snaphot-create, snapshots, backup-policy-plan-create and backup-policy-plan-update commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.12.0 \n\nVersion 6.12.0 was released on 2023-06-01.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for fileshare mount targets in share commands (Beta).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* Fixed bare-metal-server-network-interfaces, bare-metal-server-profiles and bare-metal-servers commands to print correct response values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.11.1 \n\nVersion 6.11.1 was released on 2023-05-03.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-cli-rn"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-142081-143984","score":16.6875455853,"text":"\nFor example, the Overview page includes several new, detailed graphs that summarize interactions between users and your application, the amount of traffic for a given time period, and the intents and entities that were recognized most often in user conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12 March 2018 \n\nNew date and time methods\n: Methods were added that make it easier to perform date calculations from the dialog.

It uses a dictionary lookup approach to match a word from the user input to an existing entity value or synonym in the skill's training data. For example, if the user enters boook, and your training data contains a @reading_material entity with a book value, then fuzzy matching recognizes that the two terms (boook and book) mean the same thing.\n\nIn dialog, when you enable both autocorrection and fuzzy matching, the fuzzy matching function runs before autocorrection is triggered. If it finds a term that it can match to an existing dictionary entity value or synonym, it adds the term to the list of words that belong to the skill, and does not correct it.\n\nFor example, if a user enters a sentence like I wnt to buy a boook, fuzzy matching recognizes that the term boook means the same thing as your entity value book, and adds it to the protected words list.

This field stores the user's original input that includes any misspelled words in it. And the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected. Set the condition for the dialog node or conditional response that is asking for confirmation to original_text. This means that if the user's input was automatically corrected, show the corresponding response. And the response can contain the expression: You said: <?","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-spell-check"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13878-17352-18831","score":13.4058184621,"text":"\n* Tutorial: [Apply end to end security to a cloud application](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-cloud-e2e-security)\n* Tutorial: [Best practices for organizing users, teams, applications](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-users-teams-applications)\n* Blog: [Cloud App Security: What Makes a Secure App?](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/cloud-app-security)\n* Blog: [Onboarding Cloud Projects: Security and Resource Considerations](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/onboarding-cloud-projects-security-and-resource-considerations)\n* Blog: [Use Your FIDO2 Key for 2FA on IBM Cloud Apps](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/use-your-fido2-key-for-2fa-on-ibm-cloud-apps)\n* Blog: [Going Passwordless on IBM Cloud Thanks to FIDO2](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/going-passwordless-on-ibm-cloud-thanks-to-fido2)\n* Blog: [IBM Cloud Security Hands-On: Share Your Chatbot Project](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/share-your-chatbot-project)\n* Blog: [Increase Information Security for Db2 on IBM Cloud](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/blog\/increase-information-security-for-db2-on-ibm-cloud)\n* IBM Architecture Center: [Security to safeguard and monitor your cloud apps](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture\/architectures\/securityArchitecture)\n* [IBM Cloud platform service CLIs and APIs](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-platform-svc-cli-api)\n* [IBM Cloud Compliance Programs](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/compliance)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-extended-app-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02718-4890-5645","score":13.3256229545,"text":"\nSo we've got maybe [Writing] app one here, [Writing] app two, and say a [Writing] web page.\n\nWith a feature flagging service we can actually group these in collections so that we're a little bit more organized with which feature flags are tied to, which apps are web pages.\n\nSo now today we've learned about returning feature flags on and off without deployment testing directly in production, and then segmenting those features based on the user attributes.\n\nThank you for watching.

Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\nZoom\n\n![Flow diagram of the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718\/watson-assistant\/images\/arch-detail.png)\n\nHow it works\n\nCustomers interact with the assistant through one or more of these channels:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07148-7-2060","score":35.1815584086,"text":"\nUsing the COVID-19 kit \n\nThe COVID-19 kit is a special collection available in US instances of IBM Watson\u2122 Discovery. This pre-built collection includes more than 10 data sources you can use to fuel a dynamic chatbot built with IBM Watson\u2122 Assistant and Discovery to answer your customers' questions about COVID-19.\n\nFAQ extraction is a beta feature that was used to create question and answer pairs for the kit. The FAQ extraction beta feature is now deprecated and will stop being supported in v1 Discovery service instances on 1 March 2022. As a consequence, the COVID-19 kit data collection will stop being supported also.\n\nThe COVID-19 kit extracts answers from trusted sources and automatically updates your chatbot as the content from those sources are updated. It uses FAQ extraction machine learning models developed by IBM Research labs to extract question\/answer pairs. The kit is pre-configured with web crawl seeds from trusted sources such as the CDC, Harvard, and the United States Department of Labor. An expanded stopwords list and query expansions are also included in this collection to improve search results.

If you associated an identity without administrative privilege on the ordering service node, you will not be able to view or manage ordering service details.\n\n Why it\u2019s happening \n\nThis problem can be caused by a [bug](https:\/\/bugs.chromium.org\/p\/chromium\/issues\/detail?id=1006243) introduced by the Chrome browser Version 77.0.3865.90 (Official Build) (64-bit) that causes actions from the browser to fail.\n\n How to fix it \n\nTo resolve this problem, open the console in a new browser tab in Chrome.

If the node is a CA and the status has been gray for more than a few minutes, then it is likely that the deployment process has failed. Peers and ordering nodes take longer to deploy, but this condition can also occur when the health checker that runs against the peer or ordering nodes cannot contact the node. The request for status can fail with a timeout error because the node did not respond within a specific time period, the node could be down, or network connectivity is down.\n\n How to fix it \n\nIf this is a new node, wait a few more minutes for the deployment to complete.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-troubleshooting"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}
