John Fewster , a surgeon friend of Jenner 's from nearby Thornbury , discussed the possibility of cowpox inoculation at meetings as early as 1765 . He may have done some cowpox inoculations in 1796 at about the same time that Jenner vaccinated Phipps . However Fewster , who had a flourishing variolation practice , may have considered this option but used smallpox instead . He thought vaccination offered no advantage over variolation , but maintained friendly contact with Jenner and certainly made no claim of priority for vaccination when critics attacked Jenner 's reputation . It seems clear that the idea of using cowpox instead of smallpox for inoculation was considered , and actually tried in the late 18th century , and not just by the medical profession . Therefore , Jenner was not the first to try cowpox inoculation . However , he was the first to publish his evidence and distribute vaccine freely , provide information on selection of suitable material , and maintain it by arm - to - arm transfer .

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America .

This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird . The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England , which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall , an Elizabethan manor house in Essex , and dated to around 1575 .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_14755-15684-0-929", "score": 37.399448114902285, "text": "Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species .

Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage . However , as lagomorphs , rabbits have different nutritional requirements , so the two species can not be fed the same food .

Safer bedding materials made from hardwoods ( such as aspen ) , paper products , and corn cob materials are other alternatives . Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages ; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them , and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces , making it difficult to remove .

Suppose that we have a board set up , the pieces arrayed in a mid-game situation , and we are explaining what a ' knight ' is . In doing so , it is highly unlikely that we would use an informational summary approach , which would include telling her such things as that our knights were made of onyx , weighed 2 ounces , were forty years old , and were made in Mexico . Rather , we would provide her with information that has to do with the knight 's place or position in the total scheme of things . Thus , we would describe what a knight is by informing her of its relationships to the other pieces in the game ( e.g. , its ability to capture them , to block their movements , to move vis - a-vis them only in a certain distinctive fashion , etc . ) . Further , looking at any given knight 's position relative to other pieces in the game situation displayed , we would help her to understand its current strategic importance . The crucial point here is that our thinking about the knight , indeed our thinking about what it is to be a knight , is quintessentially relational or positional in nature . When we have completed our description , what we have given our child is a summary formulation of the knight 's status -- its overall place in the scheme of things -- not an informational summary of many different kinds of facts about knights .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_17936-18684-0-748", "score": 27.8467570134573, "text": "Infertility\nTreatment depends on the cause of infertility , but may include counselling , fertility treatments , which include in vitro fertilization .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_3763-4293-0-530", "score": 20.24495555723102, "text": "Infertility\n`` Infertility is `` a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse ( and there is no other reason , such as breastfeeding or postpartum amenorrhoea ) .

The empire in the East -- known today as the Byzantine Empire , but referred to in its time as the `` Roman Empire '' or by various other names -- ended in 1453 with the death of Constantine XI and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks .", "title": "History of the Roman Empire", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative , and financial routine of administering religious affairs , and this routine was applied to the Christian Church .

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure .

In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently .

The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border .

Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .", "title": "Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "801328598_16571-17855-0-1284", "score": 18.858887020653036, "text": "History of the Great Wall of China\nIn 221 BC , the state of Qin completed its conquest over the other Warring States and united China under Qin Shi Huang , the first emperor of China .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' .

Whenever this happens , the must - show rule trumps the exclusivity rule , resulting in both games being shown in the Bay Area at the same time . 2012 Week 17 ( December 30 ) : 49ers hosted Arizona Cardinals , Raiders played at San Diego Chargers . 2013 Week 17 ( December 29 ) : Raiders hosted Denver Broncos , 49ers played at Arizona . 2014 Week 9 ( November 2 ) : 49ers hosted St. Louis Rams , Raiders played at Seattle Seahawks . 2014 Week 17 ( December 28 ) : 49ers hosted Cardinals , Raiders played at Broncos . 2015 Week 15 ( December 20 ) : 49ers hosted Cincinnati Bengals , Raiders hosted Green Bay Packers . 2015 Week 17 ( January 3 ) : 49ers hosted Rams , Raiders played at Kansas City Chiefs . 2016 Week 15 ( December 18 ) : 49ers played at Atlanta Falcons , Raiders played at San Diego Chargers . 2016 Week 16 ( December 24 ) : 49ers played at Los Angeles Rams , Raiders hosted Indianapolis Colts . 2016 Week 17 ( January 1 ) : 49ers hosted Seattle Seahawks , Raiders played at Broncos . 2017 Week 2 ( September 17 ) : 49ers played at Seattle Seahawks , Raiders hosted New York Jets . 2017 Week 4 ( October 1 ) : 49ers played at Arizona Cardinals , Raiders played at Denver Broncos . 2017 Week 12 ( November 26 ) : 49ers hosted Seattle Seahawks , Raiders hosted Denver Broncos . 2017 Week 17 ( December 31 ) : 49ers played at Los Angeles Rams , Raiders played at Los Angeles Chargers .", "title": "National Football League on television", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "822086267_6698-7277-0-579", "score": 33.1971470902242, "text": "2017 Arizona Cardinals season\nOn December 13 , 2016 , the NFL announced that the Cardinals will play the Los Angeles Rams as one of the NFL International Series at Twickenham Stadium in London , England , with the Rams serving as the home team .

This can include disclosing information such as name , age , gender , profession , location , and also information that portrays users in certain ways . Conversations : This block represents the extent to which users communicate with other users in a social media setting . Many social media sites are designed primarily to facilitate conversations among individuals and groups . These conversations happen for all sorts of reasons . People tweet , blog , make online comments and send messages to other users to meet new like - minded people , to find a romantic partner , to build their self - esteem , or to be on the cutting edge of new ideas or trending topics .

Sharing : This block represents the extent to which users exchange , distribute , and receive content , ranging from a short text post to a link or a digital photo . The term ' social ' implies that exchanges between people are crucial .

Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other . That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers ' language : Juliet , for example , speaks of `` my only love sprung from my only hate '' and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo 's death .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed .

'' He is also well known for borrowing from the classical literature and foreign languages . He created these words by `` changing nouns into verbs , changing verbs into adjectives , connecting words never before used together , adding prefixes and suffixes , and devising words wholly original . '' Many of Shakespeare 's original phrases are still used in conversation and language today . These include , but are not limited to ; `` seen better days , strange bedfellows , a sorry sight , '' and `` full circle '' . Shakespeare added a considerable number of words to the English language when compared to additions to English vocabulary made in other times . Shakespeare helped to further develop style and structure to an otherwise loose , spontaneous language . Written Elizabethan English stylistically closely followed the spoken language . The naturalness gave force and freedom since there was no formalized prescriptive grammar binding the expression . While lack of prescribed grammatical rules introduced vagueness in literature , it also expressed feelings with profound vividness and emotion which created , `` freedom of expression '' and `` vividness of presentment '' . It was a language which expressed feelings explicitly . Shakespeare 's gift involved using the exuberance of the language and decasyllabic structure in prose and poetry of his plays to reach the masses and the result was `` a constant two way exchange between learned and the popular , together producing the unique combination of racy tang and the majestic stateliness that informs the language of Shakespeare '' .", "title": "Shakespeare's influence", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "840297813_14803-15901-0-1097", "score": 20.566770242791037, "text": "Shakespeare's reputation\nEnglish actors started visiting the Holy Roman Empire in the late 16th century to work as `` fiddlers , singers and jugglers '' , and through them the work of Shakespeare had first become known in the Reich .

After the signing of the Gandhi -- Irwin Pact , Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi -- here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties .

Even today he is remembered as the man who united India . He is , in this regard , compared to Otto von Bismarck of Germany , who did the same thing in the 1860s . Under the plan of 3 June , more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan , or choosing independence . Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede , most of the people and territory would be fragmented . The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion . Gandhi had said to Patel , `` ( T ) he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it '' . Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task . He asked V. P. Menon , a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India , to become his right - hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry . On 6 May 1947 , Patel began lobbying the princes , attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts . Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs , inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi . At these meetings , Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order . Patel invoked the patriotism of India 's monarchs , asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people . He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic , especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects . He proposed favourable terms for the merger , including the creation of privy purses for the rulers ' descendants . While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism , Patel did not rule out force .

While ranking Aniston the most attractive sitcom star of the 1990s , Josh Robertson of Complex magazine wrote that `` With the haircut , the TV fame , and a true gift for comedy ... combined , Aniston became a big star '' , replacing Cox as the show 's `` established hottie '' . According to Steve Charnock of Yahoo ! Movies , Aniston is `` the series ' only main cast member to become a bona fide movie star since the end of the show '' . While agreeing that Aniston 's film career has been successful , several critics believe that the actress ' filmography remains limited to playing Rachel - like roles in romantic comedies , save for some exceptions . Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian noted that `` Consequently , many of Aniston 's movie roles ... have been Rachel in all but name .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ?

However , the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless . Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature . In contrast to Hobbes , who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility , Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist . Actually , it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government ( i.e. , one directly chosen by all the people subject to it ) . Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature , Locke points to its good points . It is free , if full of continual dangers ( 2nd Tr. , \u00a7 123 ) .

Yield spread premiums are the cash that a mortgage company receives for originating your loan . The broker provides the client and the documentation needed to process the loan and the lender pays them for providing this service in lieu of paying one of their own loan officers .

Brokers can receive so much YSP that they can provide you with a lower rate than if you went directly to the lender and they can pay for all your closing cost as opposed to the lender who would make you pay for all the third party fees on your own . You end up with a lower rate and lower fees . Since the new RESPA law as of April came into effect in 2011 , brokers can no longer decide how much they want to make off of the loan .

Diana goes with Steve to take part in the War , and he acts as her guide into the world outside of Themyscira and how mankind functions . The two grow closer along the way , but are conflicted when Steve is more focused on stopping Doctor Maru 's bombs and Diana thinks that killing Ares will stop the war . In the climax , Steve hijacks a German strategic bomber containing the gas and sacrifices himself to incinerate it at a safe distance , his last words being to tell Diana that he can save today while she could save the world and tells her that he loves her , leaving her with his father 's watch as a keepsake before he jumps onto the plane . His sacrifice leads Diana to believe that ultimately the world can only be saved through love , not hatred .

As a pilot enters a turn , hair cells in the semicircular canals are stimulated , telling the brain that the aircraft , and the pilot , are no longer moving in a straight line but rather making a banked turn . If the pilot were to sustain a constant rate turn , the endolymph would eventually catch up with the ducts and cease to deflect the cupula . The pilot would no longer feel as if the aircraft was in a turn . As the pilot exits the turn , the semicircular canals are stimulated to make the pilot think that they are now turning in the opposite direction rather than flying straight and level . In response to this , the pilot will often lean in the direction of the original turn in an attempt to compensate for this illusion . A more serious form of this is called a graveyard spiral . Rather than the pilot leaning in the direction of the original turn , they may actually reenter the turn . As the endolymph stabilizes , the semicircular canals stop registering the gradual turn and the aircraft slowly loses altitude until impacting with the ground .", "title": "Semicircular canals", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "800932861_11128-12197-0-1069", "score": 24.205868670844374, "text": "The Tuskegee Airmen\nOriginally intended as a HBO made - for - TV project , the network invested more into the production , a reputed $8.5 million ( the largest investment in a telefilm project to date ) striving for historical accuracy .
