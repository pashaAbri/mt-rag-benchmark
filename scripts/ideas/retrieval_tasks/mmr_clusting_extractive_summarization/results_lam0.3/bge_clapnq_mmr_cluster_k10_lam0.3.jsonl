Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after G\u00fcnter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi .

Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived , with an initial television contract with the ABC network . The AFL 's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league . Meanwhile , the AFL introduced many new features to Professional Football in the United States : official time on the scoreboard clock , rather than on a watch in the referee 's pocket , as the NFL did ; optional two - point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns ; names on the jerseys of players ; and several others , including expansion of the role of minority players , actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL . The AFL also signed several star college players that had also been drafted by NFL teams . Competition for players heated up in 1965 , when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then - record US $437,000 contract . A five - year , $40 million NBC television contract followed , which helped to sustain the young league . The bidding war for players ended in 1966 , when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger , and the two leagues agreed on one that would take full effect in 1970 .

Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield .

Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) .

A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 . Others believe `` guinea '' may be an alteration of the word coney ( rabbit ) ; guinea pigs were referred to as `` pig coneys '' in Edward Topsell 's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_1589-2154-0-565", "score": 0.7658414244651794, "text": "Guinea pig\nIn Western societies , the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet , a type of pocket pet , ever since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

In return for the Soviet Union 's entrance into the war against Japan , the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island .

At the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) in Cairo , the prevention and treatment of infertility was accepted into the program of action for reproductive healthcare . Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible . Additionally , counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment , and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well . While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations ( such as sub-Saharan African countries ) , a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .", "title": "History of the Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846282869_191-787-0-560", "score": 0.756877601146698, "text": "Great Wall of China\nGreat Wall of China \u842c\u91cc \u9577\u57ce The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling Map of all the wall constructions General information Type Fortification Country China Coordinates 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff / \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff / 40.68 ; 117.23 Coordinates : 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff / \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff / 40.68 ; 117.23 Technical details Size 21,196 km ( 13,171 mi ) UNESCO World Heritage Site Official name The Great Wall Type Cultural Criteria i , ii , iii , iv , vi Designated 1987 ( 11th session ) Reference no . 438 State Party China Region Asia - Pacific", "title": "Great Wall of China", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846282869_21373-22657-0-1284", "score": 0.7562121748924255, "text": "Great Wall of China\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated , in many other locations the Wall is in disrepair .

Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling . The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin ; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls , such as those in Gubeikou , often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them . The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass : instead of laying siege , the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates . In 1215 , Genghis Khan besieged , captured , and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing ( modern - day Beijing ) . The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234 .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit .

Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China . However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate . The average size of land holdings is very small , with 70 % of holdings being less than one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) in size . Irrigation facilities are inadequate , as revealed by the fact that only 46 % of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016 , resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall , specifically the monsoon season , which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country . In an effort to bring an additional two crore hectares ( 20 million hectares ; 50 million acres ) of land under irrigation , various schemes have been attempted , including the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme ( AIBP ) which was provided \u20b9 80,000 crore ( \u20b9 800 billion ) in the union budget .

A computer connected to the Internet and having improper configurations or other security problems can be exploited by anyone from anywhere in the world , while only clients in a small geographical range can exploit an open wireless access point . Thus the exposure is low with an open wireless access point , and the risks with having an open wireless network are small . However , one should be aware that an open wireless router will give access to the local network , often including access to file shares and printers .

The argument is that anyone can sniff the traffic applies to wired networks too , where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can read the traffic . Also , anyone knowing the keys for an encrypted wireless network can gain access to the data being transferred over the network . If services like file shares , access to printers etc. are available on the local net , it is advisable to have authentication ( i.e. by password ) for accessing it ( one should never assume that the private network is not accessible from the outside ) .

The theme of a religious conflict between a Jewish merchant vs. a Christian merchant in The Merchant of Venice is generally ignored in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice as most Chinese find do not find the theme of Jewish - Christian conflict relevant. , Unlike in Western productions , the character of Shylock is very much an unnuanced villain in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice , being presented as a man capable only of envy , spite , greed and cruelty , a man whose actions are only motivated by his spiritual impoverishment .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel . '' Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position . The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends .

According to The Inquisitr News , Rachel is `` the role that would end up launching ( Aniston 's ) success '' , while Bradford Evans of Splitsider believes `` that Jennifer Aniston likely would n't have become a major movie star without Friends '' .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world .

It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day .

The Indian worm - gear roller gin , invented some time around the sixteenth century , has , according to Lakwete , remained virtually unchanged up to the present time .

Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased .

Consequently , prices of raw cotton rose . At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , cotton was grown in small plots in the Old World -- the uncrowned Americas were far better able to recruit available land with the potential for new cotton production . Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies , particularly in Haiti , but Haitian cotton production was halted by the Haitian Revolution in 1791 . The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable , leading to widespread growth of cotton plantations in the United States and Brazil . ( A strain of cotton seed brought to Natchez in 1806 , Gossypium hirsutum , would become the parent genetic material for over 90 % of world cotton production to come : it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to pick . ) The Americas , particularly the U.S. , had labor shortages and high priced labor , which made slavery attractive . America 's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable , and able to keep up with demand .

Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen , but they were not as great as in cotton . Steam power -- the efficiency of steam engines increased so that they used between one - fifth and one - tenth as much fuel . The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses . The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio , making it suitable for transportation . Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800 . Iron making -- the substitution of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production . Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces , resulting in economies of scale . The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760 . It was later improved by making it double acting , which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures . The puddling process produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the finery forge . The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron . Hot blast ( 1828 ) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades .
