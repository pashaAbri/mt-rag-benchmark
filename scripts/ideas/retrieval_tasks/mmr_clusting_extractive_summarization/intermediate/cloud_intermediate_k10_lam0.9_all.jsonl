Apache Lucene. It allows you to create flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. To use IBM Cloudant Query, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a design document: In IBM Cloudant, a design document is a JSON document that contains query definitions, views, and other database-related settings. You can create a design document using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard or by making a PUT request to the `/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC` endpoint.\n2. Define an index: Within a design document, you can define one or more indexes using the `_index` property. An index is a data structure that enables fast lookup of documents based on specific fields. Here's an example index definition:\n```json\n{\n  \"_index\": {\n    \"fields\": [\n      {\n        \"author\": \"string\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"year\": \"number\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis index enables fast lookup of documents based on the `author` and `year` fields.\n\n3. Define a query: Within a design document, you can define one or more queries using the `_search` property. A query is a set of search criteria that enables you to retrieve specific documents from the database. Here's an example query definition:\n```json\n{\n  \"_search\": {\n    \"index\": \"my_index\",\n    \"query\": \"(author:Dickens) AND (year:[1800 TO 1850])\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis query retrieves documents where the `author` field is \"Dickens\" and the `year` field is between 1800 and 1850.\n\n4. Run the query: Once you've defined an index and a query, you can run the query by making a GET or POST request to the `/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME` endpoint. Here's an example query using the IBM Cloudant Query syntax:\n```bash\nGET /mydb/_design/ddoc/_search/my_index?query=\"(author:Dickens) AND"}

For more information about how to use IAM to manage access to your resources, see [Managing access to resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources).\n\nBefore granting access to a user, you need to ensure that you have the correct access permissions for adding and removing namespaces.

If you want to differentiate access at the namespace level, you can create a subset of users and set an IAM access policy for them.

Therefore, I would recommend checking the IBM Cloud pricing documentation for a comprehensive understanding of any additional charges.\n\nTo answer your original question, if you encounter limitations with the current installation method, you could consider using Carthage as an alternative. Here's how you can install the OpenWhisk SDK using Carthage:\n\n1. Create a file named `Cartfile` in the project directory for your app and add the following line:\n```\ngithub \"openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git\" > 0.3.0 Or latest version\n```\n2. From the command line, type `carthage update --platform ios`. Carthage will download and build the SDK, creating a directory named `Carthage` in the project directory for your app, and putting an `OpenWhisk.framework` file inside `Carthage/build/iOS`.\n3. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project.\n\nAs for using the OpenWhisk SDK in your Swift code, here's a simple example:\n\n1. Import the OpenWhisk SDK into your Swift file:\n```swift\nimport OpenWhisk\n```\n2. Create an instance of the OpenWhisk client with your instance GUID, destination ID, and API key:\n```swift\nlet instanceGUID = \"<instance_guid>\"\nlet destinationID = \"<instance_destination_id>\"\nlet apiKey = \"<instance_apikey>\"\n\nlet enPush = ENPush.sharedInstance\nenPush.setCloudRegion(region: .usSouth)\nenPush.initialize(instanceGUID, destinationID, apiKey)\n```\n3. Register the device for notifications:\n```swift\nlet deviceToken = \"<apns-device-token>\"\nenPush.registerWithDeviceToken(deviceToken: deviceToken) { response, statusCode, error in\n    if let response = response {\n        print(\"Notification registration successful: \\(response)\")\n    } else if let error = error {\n        print(\"Notification registration failed with error: \\(error)"}

Run `carthage update --platform ios` from the command line. Carthage will download and build the SDK, creating a directory called `Carthage` in your project directory with the `OpenWhisk.framework` file inside.\n3. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project.\n\nIf you still encounter issues, you might want to consider installing the SDK from the source directory. However, please note that the mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces, so you might need to use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n\nRegarding the latest version of Carthage, as of now, it is 0.38.0, and you can download it from the [Carthage GitHub page](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases). Make sure to follow the instructions in the [Carthage getting started guide](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) to install and use Carthage for your project."}

modify the phone integration settings to customize the call behavior. On the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, you can configure the option 'SIP target when a call fails' to add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service or a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. Additionally, you can specify a 'Call failure message' to be played to the caller before transferring the call to a human agent. For managing transfer failures, you can configure a 'Transfer failure message' and choose whether to 'Disconnect call on transfer failure' or process a different action. If you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. Ensure that the Assistant is configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario. Furthermore, the phone integration supports disaster recovery by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.\n\nWhen using third-party providers, you should also consider security measures. You can add security to the phone connection by selecting 'Force secure trunking' to use Secure Real-Time Transfer Protocol (SRTP) to secure the audio that is transmitted over the phone. Enabling SIP authentication requires SIP digest authentication for all inbound traffic and must be sent using Transport Layer Security (TLS). If you use Twilio as your SIP trunk provider, you cannot enable SIP authentication for outbound SIP trunks to Watson Assistant. If SIP authentication is required, the SIP digest user name and password must be configured, and the SIP trunk being used to connect to Assistant must be configured to use only TLS.\n\nFor more information about configuring backup support, handling call and transfer failures, securing the phone connection, and applying advanced SIP trunk configuration settings, refer to the IBM Cloud documentation on configuring backup support and phone integration settings."}

plans.\n\n1. Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that doesn't change. For example, if you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period.\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. With this model, you pay for what you consume.\n3. Tiered: Tiered pricing is based on volume-based discounts and is divided into tiers. The more you consume, the lower the price per unit. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. In the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. In the graduated tier model, the unit price per tier decreases as your level of usage increases. The total price is the cumulative charges for each level of usage.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!

Implement network security measures such as isolating networking workloads to edge worker nodes, setting up a firewall using a gateway appliance or Calico network policies, or controlling traffic to and from your cluster with VPC security groups.\n3. Encrypt sensitive information in the cluster, such as the master's local disk and secrets.\n4. Set up a private image registry for your developers to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n5. Set pod priority to indicate the relative priority of the pods that make up your cluster's workload.\n6. Authorize who can create and update pods by configuring security context constraints (SCCs) or pod security policies (PSPs).\n7. Set up logging and monitoring to help troubleshoot issues and improve the health and performance of your cluster and apps.\n8. Be sure to use a test cluster and follow instructions to address potential issues before updating your production master. After the master update is complete, you can update your worker nodes.\n\nRegarding access, it's recommended to follow the principle of least privilege, which means granting only the necessary access to users and services to perform their tasks. You can use Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to cluster resources. Additionally, use secure authentication methods such as IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) or OIDC for user authentication and authorization.\n\nThese recommendations will help secure your IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster and ensure compliance with various industry regulations.\n\nNote: This answer is based on the provided documents."}

The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\nIn addition to this, the Watson Assistant service also supports various other skills, such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech, which can be integrated with your skills to enable voice interactions. These skills support a wide range of languages as well. For example, the Speech to Text skill supports 20 languages, and the Text to Speech skill supports 35 voices in 14 languages.\n\nHowever, please note that the specific languages supported for each skill may change over time, so it is always a good idea to refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.

When dividing a corpus into annotation sets, the overlap value specifies the percentage of documents that will be annotated by all human annotators.

They include services such as routers, firewalls, and load balancers. These services are typically run on proprietary hardware, but with Network Function Virtualization (NFV), they can be packaged as virtual machines (VMs) and run on standard servers. This allows service providers to run their networks on standard servers instead of proprietary ones, which can lead to cost savings and increased agility. The IBM Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller is used to manage and configure these VNFs. Working along with IBM Cloud Schematics (Infrastructure as Code) and the IBM Content catalog, customers are able to instantiate best-in-network solutions to manage their workload. Benefits of using VNFs include the ability to instantiate virtual network services and modify configurations without the need to deploy new network hardware, rapid service delivery, centralized policy control, and the ability to use the same routers, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs in IBM Cloud that were used in physical hardware or other cloud providers."}

Add a search integration to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers.\n\n3. **Connect to your customer service teams:** If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, you can connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider.\n\n4. **Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are:** Configure integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms or add it as a chat widget to your company website.\n\n5. **Track customer engagement and satisfaction:** Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement.\n\n6. **Integrate with databases:** If your chatbot needs to interact with a database, you can use a custom extension to expose a REST API against the database backend.\n\nRemember, while these steps can help optimize your chatbot, they do not directly address the concept of \"cosmic energy\" or \"ethereal realms\". These are philosophical or metaphysical concepts that are not grounded in the technical functionality of Watson Assistant or any other IBM product."}
