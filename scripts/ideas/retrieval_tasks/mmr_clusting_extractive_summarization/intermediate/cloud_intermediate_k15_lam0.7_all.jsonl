response.input.text, response.intents, response.top\\_intent, meta.message.entities\\_count, and workspace\\_id using the v1 /logs API.\n\nWhen working with Kubernetes Service (KSV) clusters, you can filter logs using the ibmcloud ks logging filter create command. This command allows you to filter logs based on various parameters such as cluster, type, namespace, container, level, and message.\n\nFor example:\n\n* ibmcloud ks logging filter create --cluster example-cluster --type container --namespace default --container test-container --level debug --message \"GET request\"\n\nThis command filters out all logs that are forwarded from containers with the name test-container in the default namespace that are at the debug level or less, and have a log message that contains \"GET request\".\n\n* ibmcloud ks logging filter create --cluster example-cluster --type all --level info --output json\n\nThis command filters out all the logs that are forwarded, at an info level or less, from a specific cluster. The output is returned as JSON.\n\nAdditionally, the document provides filters for viewing individual messages in a conversation with an assistant. For any user input entry, clicking \"Open conversation\" allows you to see the user input and the response made to it by the assistant within the context of the full conversation. The time shown for each conversation is localized to reflect the time zone of your browser. If the spell check feature is enabled for the skill, any user utterances that were corrected are highlighted by the Auto-correct icon, and you can hover over the underlined term to see the user's original input.\n\nThe document also mentions that creating a dialog skill is an iterative process, and while developing your skill, you can use the Try it out pane to verify that your assistant recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and make corrections as needed. However, the document does not provide specific examples of this process."}

documents that include the following fields: `author`, `title`, `year`, `pages`, `publisher`, and `url`. You want to query this database to find all books published by Penguin in the year 1840.\n\nHere's how you can do this using IBM Cloudant Query:\n\n1. Define an index for the database that includes the `publisher` and `year` fields:\n```json\n{\n  \"index\": {\n    \"fields\": [\n      \"publisher\",\n      \"year\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Use the following query to search for books published by Penguin in the year 1840:\n```json\n{\n  \"selector\": {\n    \"publisher\": \"Penguin\",\n    \"year\": 1840\n  }\n}\n```\nThis query will return all documents in the database where the `publisher` field is \"Penguin\" and the `year` field is 1840.\n\nYou can also use other features of IBM Cloudant Query, such as sorting and limiting the number of results, to further refine your queries.\n\nTo execute the query, you can use the IBM Cloudant Query API, which is available in several programming languages, including Node.js, Python, and Java. Here's an example using Node.js:\n```javascript\nconst { CloudantV1 } = require('@ibm-cloud/cloudant');\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({\n  url: 'https://<account>.cloudant.com',\n  apiKey: '<api_key>',\n  authenticator: new CloudantV1.IamAuthenticator({\n    apikey: '<api_key>',\n  }),\n});\n\nconst db = service.database('<database_name>');\n\nconst query = {\n  'selector': {\n    'publisher': 'Penguin',\n    'year': 1840\n  }\n};\n\ndb.find(query)\n  .then(res => {\n    console.log(res.result.docs);"}

This way, the call can be redirected to another zone or region. To do this, you need to request IBM to enable this 500 error response capability for your specific Watson Assistant instance. It's crucial to plan for both full and partial service outages and set up a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This includes having a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. Automation should first handle complete regional outages and then implement strategies for partial outages.\n\nFor web chat, you can use the onError listening feature to detect specific types of outage errors, such as INITIAL\\_CONFIG, OPEN\\_CONFIG, and MESSAGE\\_COMMUNICATION errors. Handling a failover for web chat is simple if you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region.

Create a type system: A type system defines the entity types and relation types that human annotators can apply when annotating text. You can upload or create the type system in the workspace and work with subject matter experts for your domain to define it.\n3. Add documents for annotation: You can create a corpus by uploading sample documents that are representative of your domain content into the workspace. You can then partition the corpus into document sets, specify the percentage of documents that are shared among all document sets, and assign the document sets to human annotators.\n4. Annotate documents: The human annotators will annotate the text according to the type system that you have defined.\n5. Train the machine learning model: Once the documents have been annotated, you can train the machine learning model. The model process manager will use the annotated text to learn how to identify entities, coreferences, and relationships of interest in new documents.\n6. Deploy the machine learning model: Once the model has been trained, you can deploy it as an API that can be used to predict the outcome with test data.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the IBM Watson Knowledge Studio documentation on creating a machine learning model."}

For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged on a per-usage basis.\n3. **Tiered**: Tiered charges are similar to metered charges, but they offer discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is often offered in simple, graduated, or block models.\n4. **Reserved**: Reserved charges are based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.

place to ensure the continuity of business operations in the event of a catastrophic disruption or failure. This includes having a disaster recovery plan, which involves knowing, preserving, and being prepared to restore all data that is maintained on IBM Cloud. IBM Cloud provides tools and procedures for copying and storing essential data in a secure location and for recovering that data to restore normalcy of operation. You are responsible for your data backup and associated recovery of your content. IBM Cloud has business continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of services within hours if a disaster occurs, but each business application has its own recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) requirements, which need to be reviewed, documented, and implemented before going to production. There are different options to implement DR solutions, such as Active/Passive and Active/Standby, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific RTO and RPO requirements.\n\nIn the case of Hyper Protect Crypto Services, a 7-day waiting period is set on the key when the first user authorizes a key for deletion, during which the key remains in the Active state and all key operations are allowed. To complete the deletion, the second user with a Manager access policy can use the IBM Cloud console or API to delete the key. After the key is deleted, it can be restored within 30 days, and associated data such as key metadata, registrations, and policies can be retrieved for up to 90 days. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged and its associated data will be permanently removed.\n\nRegarding backups, if you use Key Protect, you can designate a key to encrypt the Cloud Object Storage disk that holds your deployment's backups. However, keys in the us-south and eu-de are the only ones durable to region failures, and BYOK for backups is only available in US regions us-south and us-east, and eu-de. Backups cannot be manually deleted, but if you delete your deployment, its backups are deleted automatically.\n\nVirtual Private Endpoints (VPE) and Private Endpoint (PE) do not support automatically switching to backup during failover at this time, and their settings, specifically the Internet Protocol (IP) address"}

manage them via the IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services (CIS) console. There are different types of firewall rules available, such as IP rules, User Agent rules, Domain Lockdown rules, and Firewall rules. Each type has its own unique criteria and actions that you can define. The actions include Log, Bypass, and Allow, with varying priorities.\n\nFor lightweight firewall rules, you can navigate to Security > IP firewall. For more robust firewall rules, navigate to Security > Firewall rules. When creating a firewall rule, you can specify the criteria based on IP address, IP address range, Autonomous System Number (ASN), country/region, or other factors depending on the rule type. The action assigned to the rule will determine how CIS responds to requests that match the defined criteria.\n\nFor example, Domain Lockdown rules allow you to specify a list of IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or networks that can access a domain, subdomain, or URL. Anything not on the list is blocked.\n\nFor more details on creating and managing firewall rules, please refer to the given document or the IBM CIS documentation."}

The web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. It supports a variety of devices and platforms, and is designed to be accessible and inclusive.\n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, you can create a web chat instance for your assistant in the Watson Assistant interface, customize the style of the chat window, and then embed the generated code in your website. For further customization and extension, you can use the web chat API if you are comfortable with JavaScript code.\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure that messages originate from your website and to securely authenticate users. You can also encrypt sensitive data in the JWT payload. To enable web chat security, you need to generate a JWT signed with your private key, customize the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT, and enable security in the web chat settings.
