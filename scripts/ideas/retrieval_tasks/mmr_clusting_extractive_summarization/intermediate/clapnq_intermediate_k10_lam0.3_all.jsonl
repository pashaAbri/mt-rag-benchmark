German politician who served as the Chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974. He was a key figure in the German political landscape and was known for his policy of Ostpolitik, which aimed to improve relations with the Eastern Bloc, especially East Germany. This policy led to the negotiation of nonaggression treaties with several Eastern European countries. Before his tenure as Chancellor, Brandt served as the Mayor of Berlin from 1957 to 1966. He was a strong critic of the Berlin Wall and led demonstrations against it. Brandt's contributions to world peace were recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971. In 1987, he resigned as the chairman of the SPD after a staff member was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service."}

These viruses are weakened through various methods, such as growing them under conditions that favor the selection of less virulent strains or using biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques to modify the virus's genes.\n\nKilled vaccines, on the other hand, use the entire inactivated virus, which cannot cause the disease but can still stimulate an immune response. The virus is killed using chemicals, heat, or radiation.\n\nSubunit vaccines, such as the hepatitis B vaccine, use only a specific part of the virus, such as the capsid proteins. These vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce these vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology is also used in vaccine development, where genetic material is artificially introduced into a host organism, producing a new set of genes or recombinant DNA.

Players are awarded roster spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner.

Only after John Snow established the link between contaminated water and disease in 1854 and after authorities became gradually convinced of that link, water treatment plants were added and public health improved. In the United States, the first reclaimed water facility for the reuse of treated wastewater in landscape irrigation was built in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, in 1932."}

egg donation agencies typically act as intermediaries between egg donors and recipients. They are organized entities that facilitate the process of egg donation by finding and screening potential donors, matching them with recipients, and handling the necessary legal and administrative tasks. Donors who work with agencies often appreciate the support and resources provided throughout the process, while recipients benefit from the efficiency and reduced risks associated with working with pre-screened donors. However, it is also possible for recipients to individually contract with donors outside of an agency, but this approach may involve more effort, risk, and uncertainty."}

The Indian government has taken steps to encourage the growth of organized retail, with policies such as allowing 51% FDI in multi-brand retail and 100% FDI in single-brand retail in 2012.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges to the growth of organized retail in India. One major issue is the lack of back-end warehouse infrastructure and state-level permits and red tape, which can make it difficult for retailers to operate efficiently. Additionally, compliance with numerous regulations such as \"signboard licenses\" and \"anti-hoarding measures\" is required before a store can open for business.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Indian retail market is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2020, making it one of the fastest-growing retail markets in the world. The retail industry is also a significant contributor to the Indian economy, with the sector contributing $482 billion (22% of GDP) and employing 249.94 million people (57% of the workforce) in 2016.\n\nChennai, in particular, is an important retail market in India, with several malls and a thriving retail industry.

The surname has two major branches, Leuva and Kadva, which are mainly distinguished by geographic location and varying cultural practices. Today, the surname is used by Hindus and is found in several other countries, with roughly 150,000 Patels in Britain and 150,000 in the US. Nearly 1 in 10 people of Indian origin in the US is a Patel. The term patel derives from the word Patidar, meaning \"one who holds (owned) pieces of land called patis,\" implying a higher economic status than that of the landless.

However, several reasons have been given for this practice. The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered, based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who broke a vessel to calm down exuberant wedding celebrations. Another common explanation is that it serves as a reminder that Jews still mourn the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Some people recite the verses \"If I forget thee / O Jerusalem ... \" (Ps. 137 : 5) during this part of the ceremony.\n\nThe former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Ovadia Yosef, criticized the way this custom is sometimes carried out, emphasizing that it should express sorrow over Jerusalem's destruction instead of becoming an occasion for lightheartedness.\n\nIn Reform Judaism, there is a new custom where brides and grooms break the wine glass together. This practice is part of the common features of a Jewish wedding, which also includes a ketubah (marriage contract), a wedding canopy (chuppah or huppah), a ring owned by the groom given to the bride under the canopy, and the breaking of a glass."}

During the Industrial Revolution, it became a major location for production due to its ability to facilitate fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast. Hundreds of factories were built around the Hudson, and the river was linked to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes, allowing manufacturing in the Midwest to use the river for transport. The Hudson was also the site of the first commercially successful steamboat, the North River Steamboat (later known as Clermont), which began operating in 1807.\n\nAdditionally, the Hudson is a tidal estuary, which means it is partially open to the sea and subject to tides. The lower Hudson experiences strong tides, making parts of New York Harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate. Ice floes may also drift south or north depending on the tides during the winter.\n\nFurthermore, the Hudson River and its tributaries, notably the Mohawk River, drain a large area. Parts of the Hudson River form coves, such as Weehawken Cove in the towns of Hoboken and Weehawken in New Jersey."}

Cummings's life was marked by his passion for poetry, which began in his childhood and continued throughout his adult life. He graduated from Harvard University and developed an interest in modern poetry, which ignored conventional grammar and syntax. His poetry often explores themes of love, nature, and the relationship between the individual and society, and is known for its unconventional style, including unusual word order, unorthodox typography, and punctuation.\n\nHis father's death had a significant impact on Cummings, leading him to focus on more profound aspects of life in his poetry. His famous poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\" is a tribute to his father.\n\nCummings's visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and surrealism, which influenced his later work. His later poetry became more lucid, moving, and profound, as he began to rely on symbolism and allegory instead of simile and metaphor. He also incorporated imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nTherefore, Cummings's life and experiences significantly influenced his poetry, and his famous poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\" was affected by the profound impact of his father's death on his life and artistic expression."}

This traditional cotton gin is still in use in the Indian subcontinent today. Eli Whitney's cotton gin, which used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint, revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States. Modern automated cotton gins are also used today, offering higher productivity than their hand-powered forebears."}

Another type is remote photography, which is a variation on aerial air-to-air photography, where the camera is mounted onto the external aircraft structure away from the photographer and is triggered remotely using a mechanical or electrical shutter release. This type of aviation photography is the least common. Military aviation photography, especially air-to-air, requires additional skills, as the photo and target aircraft often fly at velocities of over Mach 1 while under moderate to high G."}
