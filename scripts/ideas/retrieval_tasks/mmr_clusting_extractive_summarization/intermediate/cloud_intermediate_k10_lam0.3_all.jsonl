practices:\n\n1.

Start with a double-digit partition value. An optimal single object size is about 128 MB.\n3. Use Parquet as the output format (STORED AS clause) instead of CSV or JSON. Avoid working with Gzip objects.\n4. If you already follow the previous recommendations and still get out of memory errors, try breaking down complex statements into multiple SQL statements.\n5. When using time series functions, consult the relevant FAQ for guidance.\n\nAdditionally, if you have more than 150,000 objects in a single source location and you're not using a catalog table, it's possible that your query fails with an error. To successfully query the source location, you can:\n\n1. Create a table with the correct schema specified.\n2. If using more than 10 UNION/JOIN constructs for different source URIs, try to lower the number of different sources.\n\nFinally, the amount of data scanned depends on the amount of data that Data Engine must read to run your query, not on the actual size of your data. The data layout, object layout, and the actual query all play a role in determining how much data needs to be accessed. Each successful query is charged with at least 10 MB. So, optimizing your data layout and query structure can help improve performance and reduce costs.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}

Here are some general steps to use the API:\n\n1. Obtain your Data Engine instance's Cloud Resource Name (CRN) from the IBM Cloud console. This CRN is required for all REST API requests.\n2. Authenticate your API requests using an IAM token or an API key. You can generate an IAM token using the IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, or you can use an API key that you created for your Data Engine instance.\n3. Construct the API request by specifying the REST endpoint for your query, along with any necessary parameters and data.\n4. Send an HTTP request to the API endpoint using a tool or library of your choice. You can use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or programming languages like Python or JavaScript to send the request.\n5. Handle the API response, which will contain the query results and any relevant metadata.\n\nHere is an example of a simple API request to run a query:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}\" \\\n  --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  --data '{\n    \"query\": \"SELECT * FROM my_table\",\n    \"parameters\": [],\n    \"max_rows\": 100,\n    \"into\": \"my_bucket/result.csv\"\n  }' \\\n  \"https://data-engine-service-crn.databases.appdomain.cloud/v3/sql_queries\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `curl` command sends an HTTP POST request to the Data Engine REST API endpoint for running SQL queries. The request includes an IAM token for authentication, a JSON payload with the query and other parameters, and a URL with the CRN for the Data Engine instance.\n\nThe JSON payload includes the query itself, an empty list of parameters, a limit of 100 rows for the query result, and a target location for storing the result in a Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket.\n\nThe response to this API request will include the query result and any relevant metadata, such as the number of rows and the elapsed time."}

and querying mechanism built on Apache Lucene. It allows you to create custom indexes using a supplied JavaScript function and perform flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields.\n\nHere are some steps to use IBM Cloudant Query:\n\n1. Create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data.\n2. Create secondary indexes using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard or APIs to help service your query access patterns. This is important because query performance can degrade as your data volume grows without proper indexing.\n3. Use the `_find` API to query your database using IBM Cloudant Query. The `_find` API allows you to perform simple or complex queries using a JSON query string.\n\nHere is an example query that searches for documents with a \"title\" field that contains the word \"gatsby\" and an \"author\" field that starts with the word \"fitz\":\n```bash\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\"title:gatsby AND author:fitz*\"\n```\nIn this example, `$DATABASE` is the name of your database, `$DDOC` is the name of the design document that contains the index, and `$INDEX_NAME` is the name of the index.\n\nKeep in mind that IBM Cloudant Query is not the only querying mechanism available in IBM Cloudant. You can also use the `_all_docs` endpoint for simple queries, or the `_list` and `_view` endpoints for more complex queries.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}

Do not put personal information in the namespace name.\n2.

in the Watson Assistant phone integration. You can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. This can be done by specifying a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues on the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings. Additionally, you can define a call failure message and a transfer failure message.\n\nHowever, the document does not directly address the use of third-party providers in case of call and transfer failures. In general, if you are experiencing call and transfer failures, you may want to consider working with a reliable SIP trunking provider that can offer redundancy and disaster recovery options. This can help ensure that your phone integration remains operational even in the event of service outages or other issues.\n\nWhen working with third-party providers, it is important to make sure that the provider's service is compatible with the Watson Assistant phone integration and that any necessary configuration changes are made on both ends to ensure seamless operation. You may also want to consider implementing a failover strategy that can automatically switch to a backup provider in case of failures.\n\nIn summary, while the IBM Cloud documentation provides information on how to handle call and transfer failures within the Watson Assistant phone integration, working with a reliable SIP trunking provider and implementing a failover strategy can help ensure seamless operation and minimize downtime in case of failures."}

metastore server. The Hive metastore server stores metadata related to Hive and other services, such as table schema and partition locations. The Hive metastore client is used by Spark to access this metadata, which is necessary for Spark to read and write data to and from Hive-compatible data sources. The Hive metastore client is typically included in the classpath of a Spark application and configured to connect to the Hive metastore server using a specific URI and connection settings.\n\nIn the provided document, the Hive metastore client is a Hive-compatible client that is used to connect to the Data Engine catalog. This client is required to be placed in a directory of the Apache Spark cluster that is not on the classpath, as it is loaded into an isolated classloader to avoid version conflicts. The client is compatible with Hive metastore version 3.1.2, but includes additional enhancements for TLS and authentication through IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management.\n\nThe Hive metastore client is also configured using various Spark configuration properties, such as:\n\n* spark.hive.metastore.uris: The URI of the Hive metastore server.\n* spark.hive.metastore.use.SSL: Whether to use SSL when connecting to the Hive metastore server.\n* spark.hive.metastore.truststore.password: The password for the truststore used to authenticate to the Hive metastore server.\n* spark.hive.metastore.client.auth.mode: The client authentication mode used to connect to the Hive metastore server.\n* spark.hive.metastore.client.plain.username: The plaintext username used to authenticate to the Hive metastore server.\n* spark.hive.metastore.client.plain.password: The plaintext password used to authenticate to the Hive metastore server.\n\nThese configuration properties are used to specify the connection details and authentication information for the Hive metastore client. They are necessary to ensure that the Hive metastore client can successfully connect to the Hive metastore server and access the necessary metadata."}

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your online accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide a second form of authentication in addition to your password.\n4. Keep your software and devices up to date with the latest security patches and updates.\n5. Be wary of suspicious emails, messages, and links. Don't click on links from unknown sources, and be cautious when providing personal information online.\n6. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection and hide your IP address.\n7. Use antivirus software and a firewall to protect your devices from malware and other threats.\n8. Be aware of your browser's security settings and use them to protect your privacy.\n9.

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted, regardless of how much or how little you use the service. For example, if you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period.\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. This means you pay for what you use, and the cost will vary depending on how much of the service you consume. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Similar to metered charges, tiered charges are based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. This pricing model is typically offered for services where you can reserve a service instance for a discounted price for a certain period of time. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n\nIt's important to note that different fees, discounts, and taxes may apply depending on the type of charge, and the pricing can vary by region. Additionally, some charges might be in advance, such as infrastructure monthly usage charges, or in arrears, such as infrastructure hourly charges from the previous month.

For new US-based Pay-As-You-Go accounts with credit card billing, you can add, replace, or edit credit card details on the Payments page. If you manage your payment method on a separate billing platform, you can register, update, or delete a payment method by going to IBM Billing.\n\n3. Track your usage: To view usage data for resources, you must be assigned the correct access. Access can be assigned at the account level or to individual resource groups and Cloud Foundry orgs.\n\n4. Manage your invoices: If you have a Pay-As-You-Go account that's billed in US dollars, you can view your invoice in the IBM Cloud console. If you own one of the following accounts, you can view your invoice on the IBM Invoices website.\n\n5. Monitor the status of your payment method updates: When you request to change your payment method, a support case is created automatically. Go to the Manage cases page in the IBM Cloud console to view the status of your request.\n\n6. Deleting a credit card: For Pay-As-you-Go accounts, you must have an active credit card on file. You can replace an existing credit card with a new one. To remove a credit card and switch to a different payment method, click Pay with Other > Submit change request. To complete the change, review and update the support case that is created for you.\n\n7. Changing invoice currency: Invoicing in your local currency might be possible if you have a subscription or IBM Cloud Cloud Enterprise Savings Plan account type. Contact IBM Cloud Cloud Sales for more information.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation on managing payments (<https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-linkedusagepayment-method-ibm>)."}

Also, only data that was added by using the POST /message API endpoint with an associated customer ID can be deleted using this method.

Conversational skills return responses that are authored by you to answer common questions, while a search skill searches for and returns passages from existing self-service content. By adding conversational skills, you can understand and address questions or requests that your customers typically ask about. An actions skill offers a simple interface for building a conversational flow, while a dialog skill allows you to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree, with the dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize. A search skill can give your assistant access to existing content in your organization's technical information collateral, allowing it to return smart answers to natural language questions.

Once connected, you can use the `client` object to interact with your IBM Cloudant service. For example, here's how you can create a new database:\n```python\nclient.create_database('mydb')\n```\nThis will create a new database called 'mydb' in your IBM Cloudant service. To fetch data from the database, you can use the `get_document` method of the `client` object, like this:\n```python\ndocument = client.get_document('mydb', 'mydoc')\n```\nThis will fetch the document with id 'mydoc' from the 'mydb' database.

To resolve this issue, you should review the resources associated with the key before deleting it. You can force deletion on a key that's protecting a cloud resource, but the action won't succeed if the key's associated resource is nonerasable due to a retention policy.\n2.

IBM Cloud has business continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of services within hours if a disaster occurs. You are responsible for your data backup and associated recovery of your content. IBM Cloud performs regular electronic backups of project data with Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of hours as documented in the IBM Cloud Disaster Recovery Plan. Projects don't replicate data outside of a region, except for backup data. When possible, backup data is kept within the data centers of a country but data is always kept within a geography. European data does not leave the EU.\n\nIn the context of Hyper Protect Crypto Services, IBM is responsible for the recovery of service components in case of disaster, while you are responsible for the recovery of the workloads that run Hyper Protect Crypto Services and your application data. IBM will ensure that all data except the master key is replicated to another region in case of a regional disaster that affects all available zones. You will need to load your master key to the new crypto units that IBM provisions in a different region for restoring data.\n\nFor more information about your responsibilities when using projects, see Shared responsibilities for projects.

Internet Services) Firewall Rules interface. The type of firewall rules you can create include Access Rules, User Agent Rules, and Domain Lockdown rules. These rules can be based on IP address, IP address range, Autonomous System Number (ASN), or country/region. Domain Lockdown rules, in particular, specify a list of IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or networks that can access a domain, subdomain, or URL. Anything not on the list is blocked.\n\nTo add or modify firewall rules, you can use the `ibmcloud cis firewalls` command. This command allows you to specify the type of firewall rule (access-rules, ua-rules, or lockdowns), the DNS Domain ID, and the IP addresses or ranges to allow or block.\n\nIf you are using allowlists to control connections in your environment, you can use the provided IP lists to allowlist Db2 on Cloud deployments. These lists include all of the subnet ranges for the entire region that your deployments live in. You should allowlist all of the subnet ranges to ensure that all connections to your Db2 on Cloud deployments are allowed.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a Domain Lockdown rule using the `ibmcloud cis firewalls` command:\n```\nibmcloud cis firewalls -t lockdowns -d <DNS_DOMAIN_ID> --json '{\"urls\": [\"example.com\"], \"configurations\": [{\"target\": \"ip\", \"value\": \"123.45.67.89\"}]}' -i <INSTANCE>\n```\nThis command creates a Domain Lockdown rule for the DNS domain with the specified ID (`<DNS_DOMAIN_ID>`), allowing access to the URL \"example.com\" from the IP address \"123.45.67.89\". Replace `<DNS_DOMAIN_ID>` and `<INSTANCE>` with the actual values for your DNS domain and CIS instance."}

If the variables increase or decrease together, they are said to have a positive correlation. If one variable increases while the other decreases, they are said to have a negative correlation.\n\nTo calculate the correlation between any three metrics, you would typically use a statistical method such as Pearson's correlation coefficient, which measures the linear correlation between two datasets.\n\nHowever, without knowing which specific metrics you are referring to, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.

The home screen displays a greeting and an optional set of suggested conversation starters for common questions and problems. The customer can either click a conversation starter or type a message in the input field to start the conversation with the assistant. The appearance and behavior of the launcher icon, the home screen, and most other aspects of the web chat can be configured and customized to match your website style and branding. The web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant and supports a variety of devices and platforms. For optimal results on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include a specific metadata element. The web chat integration complies with the Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA standard and is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis."}
