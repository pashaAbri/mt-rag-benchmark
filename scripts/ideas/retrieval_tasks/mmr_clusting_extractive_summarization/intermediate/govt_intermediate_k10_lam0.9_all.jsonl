Recycling law (AB 341), the Mandatory Organics Recycling law (AB 1826), and California's Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction law (SB 1383). These ordinances aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and divert recyclables and compostables from the landfill, with a long-term goal of ensuring that 75% of these materials are diverted by 2025.\n\nFor the Mandatory Commercial Recycling law (AB 341), businesses and institutions with 4 or more cubic yards of garbage service and multi-family properties with 5 or more units are required to recycle. Violation of this ordinance may result in a fine, as it is considered an infraction.\n\nFor the Mandatory Organics Recycling law (AB 1826), businesses and multifamily complexes generating specified amounts of organic waste are required to arrange for organics collection services. Non-compliance may lead to fines, as this is also considered an infraction.\n\nFor SB 1383, California's Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction law, businesses, institutions, and multi-family properties are required to collect food scraps and compostable paper separately from garbage. The penalty for non-compliance is not specified in the document.\n\nIn addition to these state laws, Alameda County's Organics Reduction and Recycling Ordinance (SB 1383) also went into effect on January 1, 2022. This ordinance aims to keep food and other compostable materials (\"organics\") out of landfills to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. The penalties for violating this ordinance are not specified in the document provided.\n\nIt is essential to comply with these ordinances to help the state reach its waste reduction goals and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal."}

severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. Millions of people in the United States and hundreds of millions worldwide have received the vaccine with only mild side effects in most cases. These side effects may include soreness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, and fever, but they are generally not long-lasting.\n\nSerious side effects are rare, but a small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis after receiving the vaccine. However, healthcare facilities are prepared to treat such reactions immediately.\n\nIt is important to continue monitoring for any reactions, side effects, or adverse events after receiving the vaccine and inform your healthcare provider if any occur. The VA uses a vaccine monitoring and tracking system to record and report such incidents, which is the same system used for other vaccines like the flu and shingles.\n\nIn summary, while some mild side effects are possible, COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness from the virus."}

Fraud alert for prevention: A fraud alert requires creditors who check your credit report to take steps to verify your identity before opening a new account, issuing an additional card, or increasing the credit limit on an existing account.\n\n3. Fraud by fiduciaries: When a fiduciary, such as an agent under a power of attorney or a court-appointed guardian, spends the money for his or her own benefit, that may be fraud.\n\n4. Identity theft: Identity theft occurs when someone steals your identity to commit fraud, such as using personal information without your permission, such as your name, Social Security number, bank account information, or credit card number.\n\n5. Imposter scams: Imposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization.\n\n6. Mail fraud: Mail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n7. Phishing: In phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information.\n\n8. Security freeze for prevention: A security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.\n\n9. Spoofing: Spoofing occurs when a caller disguises the information shown on your caller ID, giving the caller the ability to disguise or \"spoof\" the name and/or number to appear as though they are calling as a certain person from a specific location.\n\n10. Wire or money transfer fraud: Some scammers trick you into wiring or transferring money to steal from you. An example of a wire transfer fraud is the \u201cgrandparent scam.\u201d"}

If you harvest an animal from a state or region without chronic wasting disease (CWD), the meat is safe to consume. If the animal is harvested from a state or region with CWD, it is recommended to have the animal tested before consuming the meat. If the animal tests positive for CWD, it is best to avoid consuming the meat due to the persistence of prions. Always check the CWD status of the state you are planning to hunt in and follow the guidelines for importing game meat back to California."}

However, the amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is relatively small compared to human emissions.

Sample Collection Video Game, here are some steps you can follow:\n\n1. Select the sprite you want to script by clicking on it in the Sprites window.\n2. Click on the \"Scripts\" tab in the bottom half of the screen.\n3. You can use various coding blocks to script the behavior of the sprite. For example, you can use blocks from the \"Motion\" category to make the sprite move, or blocks from the \"Control\" category to make the sprite respond to user input.\n4. To make the rover move up, down, left, and right on the screen, you can use the arrow keys as input. For example, you can use the \"when [space] key pressed\" block from the \"Events\" category to detect when the space key is pressed, and then use the \"move [10] steps\" block from the \"Motion\" category to move the sprite up by 10 steps.\n5. To make the sample tube sprites disappear when they are visited by the rover, you can use a block from the \"Control\" category, such as \"if then,\" to check if the rover and the sample tube are at the same coordinates. If they are, you can use the \"hide\" block from the \"Looks\" category to make the sample tube sprite disappear.\n6. Remember to test your script regularly to make sure it's working as intended.

Saturn's rings are visible using a small telescope or a high-powered pair of binoculars. The larger the telescope, the more detail you will be able to see. To optimize your chances of seeing Saturn's rings, it is recommended to go to a location with minimal light pollution.\n\nAdditionally, Saturn's rings are more easily visible at certain times of the year due to its orbit and the Earth's. The best times to observe Saturn's rings are during its opposition, which occurs every 378 days when Saturn, Earth, and the Sun are aligned, with Earth in the middle. At opposition, Saturn is at its closest approach to Earth, making its rings appear brighter and more prominent.\n\nLight pollution can impact your ability to see celestial objects like Saturn and its rings, especially in urban areas. So, going to a dark location outside of a city would help you see Saturn's rings more clearly."}

Find a lawyer: You can find a lawyer through lawyer referral services, your local county bar association, LawhelpCalifornia.org, the State Bar's Lawyer Referral Services Directory, or by searching for a State Bar-certified specialist. You can also ask for referrals from friends, co-workers, employers, other lawyers, or business people. Check if you may belong to a prepaid group legal service plan through your employer, union, or credit union.\n3. Check the lawyer's background: Before meeting with a lawyer, review their background and discipline record at the State Bar's Attorney Search web page. Make sure the lawyer is in good standing with the State Bar.\n4. Interview the lawyer: When you meet with a lawyer, ask about their experience, the steps involved in your case, the possible outcomes, how long the case may take, and any alternatives such as arbitration or mediation. You should also ask how the lawyer charges, including their hourly rate, fixed fee, contingency fee, retainer fee, and any other expenses. Ask if you can do some of the work to reduce fees.\n5. Decide if this is the lawyer for you: Consider whether you will be comfortable working closely with the lawyer, if you think they have the experience and skill to handle your case, if you understand their explanation of your case, if the fee seems reasonable, and if you are comfortable with the agreement before signing it. If you are not comfortable with any of the terms, do not sign it and find a new lawyer.\n6.

The purpose of spousal support is to help the lower earning spouse maintain a similar standard of living as during the marriage. The amount and duration of spousal support can be determined by agreement of the parties or by a court. In California, the court considers various factors such as the length of the marriage, the earning capacity of each spouse, the age and health of the spouses, and the standard of living established during the marriage.\n\nIn the context of divorce proceedings, the court may issue temporary spousal support orders (pendente lite) to maintain the financial status quo until a final judgment is entered. Once the divorce is finalized, the court may issue a final spousal support order as part of the judgment.\n\nIt's important to note that the documents provided do not mention whether a jail sentence can be given for failure to pay spousal support.

Comets are large objects made of dust and ice that orbit the Sun. They are known for their long, streaming tails, and are thought to hold material from the time when the Sun and planets were forming. Comets are mostly found in the Kuiper Belt, a wide disk beyond the orbit of Neptune, or in the Oort Cloud, the sphere-shaped, outer edge of the solar system that is about 50 times farther away from the Sun than the Kuiper Belt. Gravity from a planet or star can pull comets from their homes in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud and redirect them toward the Sun, creating long, stretched oval paths. When a comet gets close to the Sun, it starts heating up and the ice turns to gas, creating a huge, fuzzy cloud around the nucleus called the coma. Comets actually have two separate tails: a white dust tail and a bluish ion tail made up of electrically charged gas molecules.

The program has expanded since then, but still concentrates on smaller missions that require less resources and shorter development times than the larger \"flagship\" missions. The program encourages the use of new technologies, transfer of these technologies to the private sector, increased participation of small and disadvantaged businesses, the pursuit of innovative ways of doing business, and support of the nation's educational initiatives. Some of the missions that are part of the Discovery Program include Psyche, Lucy, InSight, GRAIL A and B, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Kepler, Dawn, Deep Impact Extended Mission (EPOXI), MESSENGER, CONTOUR, Genesis, and Stardust. These missions have been selected for their potential to make significant scientific breakthroughs in areas such as understanding the formation of the solar system, the history of water on Mars, and the interior of the Earth's Moon. Additional information about the NASA Discovery program can be found at <https://www.nasa.gov/solarsystem>\n\nPlease note that the Deep Impact mission is not part of the NASA Discovery program, but it was a separate mission with a different funding and management structure, which was later selected for an extended mission, EPOXI, which was part of the Discovery program."}

Here's a simplified version of the steps provided by Madison County, NY:\n\n1. **Choose a bin:** Your bin should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size. A sunny spot will help it dry out, while a shady spot will help it retain moisture. A closed bin is necessary to keep critters out and to keep in the microbes that break down the waste. If you make your own closed bin, drill holes to allow oxygen exchange.\n\n2. **Gather materials:** Compost materials can be divided into \"browns\" and \"greens.\" Browns are higher in carbon and include items like leaves, straw, wood chips, and cardboard. Greens are higher in nitrogen and include items like vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and grass clippings. A good rule of thumb is to use 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Do not include feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter.\n\n3. **Maintain the pile:** If you have an open bin, layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom for air and drainage. Layer browns and greens in a ratio of 3:1, with greens in the middle. Keep the compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung-out sponge. Turning the pile helps it break down faster and ensures oxygen is present.\n\n4. **Harvest and more:** Your compost is ready when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. This usually takes a few months. If you don't fully turn the pile, the finished compost will be at the bottom. If you're running out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel rolls, and toilet paper rolls make good additions.\n\nRemember, composting at home reduces waste and provides a valuable soil amendment for your garden or house plants. For more resources, you can visit websites like compost.css.cornell.edu, epa.gov/recycle/composting-home, or dec.ny.gov/chemical/8799.html."}

But for the Soviet orbit made three years earlier, is there any info about what it mapped? {\"class\": \"non-standalone\", \"reworded version\": \"Is there any information about what the Soviet orbit made three years earlier mapped?\"}.", "timing": {"extract_sentences": 0.00010013580322265625, "compute_embeddings": 0.11310601234436035, "clustering": 3.790855407714844e-05, "mmr_selection": 1.1920928955078125e-06, "llm_rewrite": 3.266274929046631, "total_rewrite_pipeline": 3.3795201778411865, "retrieval": 0.3380727767944336, "generation": 4.586169004440308, "total_turn": 8.303887844085693}, "contexts": [{"document_id": "d430fcc6509467a4-9471-11452", "title": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits", "score": 21.828016, "url": "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/"}, {"document_id": "a219ceb7178fd438-7609-9715", "title": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits", "score": 21.572046, "url": "http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/page2.php"}, {"document_id": "d430fcc6509467a4-10981-13051", "title": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits", "score": 20.947498, "url": "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/"}, {"document_id": "a219ceb7178fd438-6127-8141", "title": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits", "score": 20.904337, "url": "http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/page2.php"}, {"document_id": "d430fcc6509467a4-17562-19662", "title": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits", "score": 20.291492, "url": "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/"}], "agent_response": "An Earth satellite orbit refers to the path taken by a satellite as it revolves around the Earth.

Elliptical galaxies are shaped like stretched-out circles, or ellipses, and contain mostly older stars. They are the largest and most common galaxies observed, making up about 20% of nearby galaxies. Irregular galaxies have no common shape and are among the smallest galaxies scientists have observed. They often contain gas, dust, and bright young stars.
