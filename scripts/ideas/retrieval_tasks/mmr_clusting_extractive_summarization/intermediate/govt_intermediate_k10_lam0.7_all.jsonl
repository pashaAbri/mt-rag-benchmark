A central cyclone at the north pole is surrounded by eight more, all smacking together yet not merging, with each storm stretching more than 2,500 miles across. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone that had somehow muscled into a pattern of six cyclones, which had previously seemed locked in place.\n\nAfter entering Jupiter's orbit, Juno made several more discoveries. It found that Jupiter's magnetic field is far more intense than expected, with some places being more than 30 times as powerful as the one surrounding Earth. Juno also solved a mystery about the low water content near Jupiter's equator that the Galileo spacecraft had found. It showed that water is much more abundant nearer Jupiter's equator.\n\nJuno also discovered that high-voltage electrical charges contribute to the formation of auroras at Jupiter's poles, with the most powerful energies reaching 400,000 electron volts, significantly more than the few thousand volts of our most powerful auroras on Earth.\n\nIn addition, Juno found that Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a signature cyclone, is slowly shrinking, from twice Earth's size in 1979 to 1.3 times its current size. Juno plumbed the depths of this cyclone, showing that its roots run 200 miles deep.\n\nSince April 2022, Juno has been observing the volcano-covered moon Io and has sent back images that appear to show fresh lava fields, in areas last seen in visible-light images during Galileo and New Horizon flybys.\n\nPlease note that these are just a few of Juno's discoveries, and the spacecraft continues to provide new insights into Jupiter and its moons."}

Use filters: Your mobile phone probably has options to filter and block texts from unknown senders. Some wireless providers and call blocking apps can also help block unwanted messages. Many popular email providers (like Gmail) have strong spam filters turned on by default. But if any spam gets into your inbox, mark it as spam or junk.\n\n2. Protect your personal information: Before you enter personal information on a website, email, or text chain, stop. Ask yourself: Why do they need this information? And what\u2019s going to happen to it? Remember, too: never share your Social Security number with someone who reaches out to you.\n\n3. Unsubscribe from unwanted emails: Getting fewer unwanted emails helps you avoid clicking on links that can lead to a phishing attack. However, be cautious as unsubscribing may not be a good option all the time. Fine with legit sites but unsubscribe can confirm a \u201creal\u201d recipient to a scammer who can share your address and increase targeting for phishing.\n\n4. Report unwanted messages: Unwanted messages often lead to scams. Report them.\n\n5. Don't click on any links in a spam email, even if it says \"unsubscribe here\". Always report the offending email to the ISP.\n\n6. If you receive spam texts that arrive as MMS, be careful not to download them as it may unleash malware scripts.\n\n7. Block unknown numbers or people who send you spam texts.\n\n8. Don't answer a phone call that you don't recognize, as it's usually a telemarketer.\n\n9. Create a filter if spam emails reach your inbox and ignore them.\n\n10. Be cautious of a large number of spam emails, as hidden somewhere in there can be a legitimate notice that a bank account was opened in your name.\n\n11. If it is not spam, they can always leave you a voice mail."}

for consuming game meat safely. If you're concerned about Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), it is essential to follow the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). They advise against consuming any tissues from CWD-infected animals. In addition, if you harvest a CWD-positive animal, ensure that the meat is disposed of properly. Do not bury, throw in the trash, leave out for scavengers, feed to your dog, or take it to a landfill. Instead, call your local CDFW office or the Wildlife Health Laboratory for assistance with safe disposal.\n\nAs for preventing West Nile virus, taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites is crucial when handling or consuming game meat. The virus is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, so take measures to minimize exposure to mosquitoes, especially in areas with reported West Nile cases.\n\nIn general, it is best to consume game meat from healthy animals, properly cooked to an internal temperature of at least 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) to kill any potential pathogens. For specific guidelines on game meat preparation and consumption, consult your local health department or wildlife agency."}

To create a pinhole projector, you can follow instructions from NASA's Space Place, which involves cutting a small hole in a piece of cardstock, taping aluminum foil over the hole, and poking a pin-sized hole in the foil.

However, during totality, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun, you can remove the filter to photograph the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona. Using a tripod and a delayed shutter release timer can help stabilize the camera and avoid taking blurry images when there is low lighting.\n\nAdditionally, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory provides educational resources about eclipses, including lesson plans and activities to expand student learning around the eclipse and related astrophysics concepts."}

However, utilizing a pinhole projector is a safe and easy method to observe solar and lunar eclipses. By projecting the image of the eclipse onto a separate surface, you avoid looking directly at the Sun or the Moon, minimizing any risk of eye damage. Additionally, NASA and other reputable organizations provide guidelines and instructions for creating and using pinhole projectors, ensuring that you have accurate and reliable information.\n\nIf you'd like, you can practice making a pinhole projector and testing it with a bright light source before the actual eclipse. This can help familiarize you with the process and alleviate any concerns you might have. Remember, millions of people around the world safely observe eclipses through various methods, including pinhole projectors, and you can do so too."}

York, serving since 2019. She is the first woman of color to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. With decades of experience and a long record of achievements, she is a powerful, effective attorney and lifelong public servant.\n\nLetitia James focused on protecting vulnerable New York residents and ensuring that individuals or companies that broke state laws were held accountable in her first term. She secured more than $7.5 billion for New York from those who broke state laws and took advantage of New Yorkers, including more than $2.5 billion from opioid manufacturers and distributors for their roles in the opioid epidemic. Under her leadership, the Office of the New York State Attorney General helped remove more than 4,000 guns from New York communities, took down dozens of dangerous drug and gun trafficking rings throughout the state, and took legal action to stop the proliferation of ghost guns.\n\nAdditionally, Letitia James took on predatory landlords who harassed tenants and endangered children by violating New York's lead paint laws. She protected New Yorkers\u2019 health and the state's natural resources by going after polluters and companies that flouted environmental protection laws. Letitia James also stood up for vulnerable populations by going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop a question about citizenship from being added to the census and successfully protecting DACA. She has been a national leader in the fight to defend access to reproductive health care, leading dozens of legal actions across the country to protect and expand access to this lifesaving care.\n\nBefore serving as Attorney General, Letitia James was the public advocate for the City of New York, the first woman of color to hold citywide office. During her tenure as public advocate, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap. Prior to serving as public advocate, Letitia James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for 10 years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that forced landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York"}

Familiarize yourself with the whistleblower laws in your state. For example, in California, you are protected from retaliation by your employer for disclosing information about violations of state or federal statutes, rules, or regulations (California Labor Code Section 1102.5(b)).\n\n2. Consider reporting the issue internally first, if your company has established procedures for handling whistleblower claims. Review these procedures to figure out how to proceed.\n\n3. If you decide to report externally, make sure to have enough information to support your claims of supposed improper or unlawful behavior.\n\n4. Keep your identity confidential or anonymous, if possible. For instance, if you're reporting to the Public Utilities Commission, they will keep your identity private if you ask to remain anonymous.\n\n5. Consult with a lawyer, especially if you fear retaliation. You may have to dedicate personal time and money to hire an attorney to file a lawsuit for retaliation.\n\n6. Be cautious about breaking confidentiality or revealing privileged information, as this could put you at risk of retaliation. California law, for example, does not protect disclosures made by private-sector whistleblowers that reveal a trade secret.\n\n7. Document everything, including the timeline of events, people involved, and any evidence you have.\n\n8. Seek support from whistleblower organizations, colleagues, or friends and family.\n\nRemember, even with these protections, there is still a risk of retaliation. It's important to take precautions to protect yourself."}

Decide when it's best to hire a lawyer. This may include having a complicated case, the other side having a lawyer, wanting legal advice, wanting a confidential attorney-client relationship, discussing strategies for your case, negotiating with the other side, worrying about the other side not playing fair, having a jury trial, or being too close emotionally to the case.\n2. Find a lawyer. You can find a lawyer through a lawyer referral service, your local county bar association, LawhelpCalifornia.org, the State Bar's Lawyer Referral Services Directory, by searching for a State Bar-certified specialist, or by asking for referrals from friends, co-workers, employers, or other lawyers.\n3. Check the lawyer's background. Review the lawyer's background and discipline record at the State Bar\u2019s web page on Attorney Search and check that the lawyer is in good standing with the State Bar.\n4. Interview the lawyer. Ask them questions about their experience, the possible outcomes of your case, how long it may take, the costs, and how they will keep you informed as the case progresses.\n5. Understand the lawyer's explanation of what your case involves and make sure the fee seems reasonable.\n6. If you decide to hire the lawyer, make sure you understand the agreement before you sign it. If you are not comfortable with any of the terms, do not sign it. And if you cannot work out your disagreement, you may want to find a new lawyer.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to understand the different ways that lawyers bill, including fixed fee, hourly fee, retainer fee, contingency fee, and statutory fee. You will also be responsible for paying the costs of your case, such as filing fees, copying expenses, and expert fees. It is a good idea to ask the lawyer for a written estimate of what the costs will be.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about your case, first talk to your lawyer. If you are having serious problems with your lawyer and have been unable to resolve them, there are other things you can do, including getting information from the State Bar."}

In California, spousal support can be temporary or permanent and is determined based on a variety of factors, including the length of the marriage, the income and earning capacity of each spouse, and the standard of living established during the marriage.\n\nIn the context of a divorce, a request for spousal support can be made through a Request for Order (RFO), which is a legal document filed with the court. If the spouses are able to agree on the terms of spousal support, they can submit a stipulated judgment to the court which outlines their agreements on property division, spousal support, child support, and child custody and visitation.\n\nIt is important to note that spousal support is not automatically granted in a divorce, and the court has discretion in determining the amount and duration of support payments. If one spouse disagrees with the court's decision on spousal support, they may have grounds to appeal the decision.\n\nIf you have any further questions about spousal support or the divorce process in California, I recommend consulting with a family law attorney or visiting the California Courts Self Help Guide for more information."}

The medium resolution camera has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at 700 km distance, while the high resolution camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km. The power of 620 W at the encounter is provided by a 7.2 square meter solar array and stored in a small NiH2 battery. The spacecraft control system consists of four hemispherical resonator gyros, two star trackers, reaction wheels, and hydrazine thrusters. Thermal control is achieved by insulating blankets, surface radiators, finishes, and heaters. The spacecraft has two redundant RAD750 computers with 309 MB each of memory for scientific data.\n\nThe impactor projectile is made of primarily copper (49%) and only 24% aluminum so it will be easily identifiable and minimize contamination in the spectra after the projectile is largely vaporized and mixed in with the comet ejecta on impact. The impactor is a short hexagonal cylinder built above the copper cratering mass. It has a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting which can provide delta-V of 25 m/s. Targeting is accomplished using a high-precision star-tracker, auto-navigation algorithms, and the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), a camera which provides images for autonomous control and targeting. The ITS will operate until impact, and images will be sent back to Earth via the flyby spacecraft. Communication with the flyby spacecraft is via S-band. The impactor is mechanically and electrically connected to the flyby spacecraft until 24 hours prior to encounter. After separation it runs on internal battery power."}

Based on the information from the Madison County, NY backyard composting guide, here are the four steps to composting at home:\n\n1. **Pick Out A Bin:** Your compost bin should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size and located in a convenient, accessible area. You can use a closed bin, like a tumbler, to keep critters out and ensure that microbes, which help break down waste, are present. If you make your own closed bin, drill holes to allow oxygen exchange. Pallets make great open compost bins if you can get a hold of them.\n\n2. **Gather Materials:** Materials for composting can be divided into two categories: \"browns\" and \"greens.\" Browns are higher in carbon and include leaves, straw, wood chips, and cardboard. Greens are higher in nitrogen and include vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, grass clippings, and manure from herbivores. Aim for a ratio of 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Do not include feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter.\n\n3. **Maintain:** Layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom of your bin for air and drainage. Then, layer your browns and greens, with greens in the middle and more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung-out sponge. Turning the pile helps break it down faster and ensures oxygen is present.\n\n4. **Harvest and More!:** Your compost is ready when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. You may need to fully turn the pile to access all of the finished compost. If you run out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel rolls, and toilet paper rolls make good additions.\n\nRemember, composting at home can reduce your waste, save money, and provide nutrient-rich soil for gardening!"}
