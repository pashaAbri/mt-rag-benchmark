An online support ticket form that customers fill out and submit\n3. A service desk solution that is configured to work with your custom client application. The built-in Zendesk and Salesforce integrations aren\u2019t supported.\n\nYou can design the dialog to recognize customer requests for help and add an intent that understands the customer request. Then, add a dialog branch that handles the request. For example:\n\nIntent name | Intent user example 1 | Intent user example 2 | Response from dialog node that conditions on intent\n--- | --- | --- | ---\ncall\\_support | How do I reach support? | What's your toll-free number? | Call 1-800-555-0123 to reach a call center agent at any time.\nsupport\\_ticket | How do I get help? | Who can help me with an issue I'm having? | Go to [Support Center](https://example.com/support) and open a support ticket.\n\nFor phone integration, you can also add support for initiating a transfer to human agents when a user asks to speak to someone or when the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature."}

It allows you to access and manage data using the supported Watson Query SDKs, such as the Go SDK and the Java SDK.\n\nThe Query API provides endpoints for various operations, including querying data, creating database objects, administering the service, and monitoring the system. The API reference for the Query API can be found in the IBM Cloud documentation.\n\nThe Query API supports the 'passages' parameter, which can be used to return a set of the most relevant passages from the documents in your collection. This feature is supported only on private collections and not in the Watson Discovery News collection. The passages parameter currently returns a maximum of three (3) passages from any given document in the collection.\n\nAdditionally, the Query API also supports the 'sort' parameter, which enables you to specify a comma-separated list of fields in the document to sort on. This feature can help you to sort and retrieve data based on specific fields and values.\n\nIt's important to note that specifying the passages parameter can reduce performance as a result of increased processing to extract passages. With larger environments, the performance impact can be lessened. Additionally, the passages parameter returns a maximum of 10 results, and the number of returned results cannot be changed.\n\nIf you need more information or have further questions about the Query API, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation and the IBM Cloud SQL Query blog for more information on using Data Engine and running queries."}

IBM Cloudant Query is a powerful feature of IBM Cloudant that allows you to query your data using a flexible query language based on Apache Lucene. Here are some steps to get started with IBM Cloudant Query:\n\n1. Define an index: Before you can query your data using IBM Cloudant Query, you need to define an index. An index is a data structure that is optimized for fast search and retrieval of data. You can define an index using a design document, which is a JSON document that contains the index definition. The index definition specifies the fields that you want to index and the parameters for each field.\n2. Query the data: Once you have defined an index, you can query the data using the _find endpoint. The query language is based on Apache Lucene, and it allows you to search for data using various operators and functions. You can search for data based on exact matches, regular expressions, ranges, and more.\n3. Retrieve the results: When you query the data using IBM Cloudant Query, you can retrieve the results in various formats, including JSON, XML, and CSV. You can also specify the number of documents to return, the sort order, and other parameters.\n\nHere's an example of how to use IBM Cloudant Query to search for documents by author and year:\n\nGET /{database}/_design/{ddoc}/_search/{index}?q=\"author:Dickens AND year:1840\"\n\nIn this example, {database} is the name of the database that contains the documents, {ddoc} is the name of the design document that contains the index definition, and {index} is the name of the index. The q parameter specifies the query, which searches for documents where the author is Dickens and the year is 1840.\n\nKeep in mind that IBM Cloudant Query is just one of the many features of IBM Cloudant, and there are many other ways to interact with your data using the IBM Cloudant API. If you have any specific questions or issues, feel free to ask!"}

transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. You can specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. Additionally, you can configure a call failure message and a transfer failure message that the assistant will say to a caller if the call transfer to a live agent fails. If you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\nIf you need to use third-party providers for handling call and transfer failures, you can consider using a SIP trunking provider that can support disaster recovery by configuring two separate SIP trunks, one for each region. The SIP INVITE failure timeouts should be set low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\nFor handling partial service outages within the region, Watson Assistant can be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. This can redirect the call to another zone or region. However, to enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nIt's important to plan for both full and partial service outages and start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment."}

The Hive-compatible client can be downloaded from the IBM SQL Query Cloud and placed in a directory of your Spark cluster that is not on the classpath.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) connector to register the required COS path used in your application and add endpoints for all buckets.

Private clouds offer greater control over data and resources but require more resources to maintain and manage.\n\n3. Hybrid clouds: Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds.

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted. It does not matter how much or how little you use the service, the charge remains the same. An example of this is the Bare Metal Servers, which are charged at a flat-rate.\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. You pay for what you consume, so if you use more or less of the service, your charge will increase or decrease accordingly. An example of this is the Push service, where any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block. It is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. An example of this is the API Connect service, which charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service and selecting the service plan that best meets your needs.\n\nI hope that helps!

procedures for returning a system, an application, or an entire data center to full operation after a catastrophic interruption. IBM Cloud has business continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of services within hours if a disaster occurs. However, customers are responsible for their data backup and associated recovery of their content. IBM Cloud performs regular electronic backups of project data with Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of hours as documented in the IBM Cloud Disaster Recovery Plan. Projects don't replicate data outside of a region, except for backup data. When possible, backup data is kept within the data centers of a country but data is always kept within a geography. European data does not leave the EU. For more information about your responsibilities when using projects, see Shared responsibilities for projects.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure as code, it ensures that good backup practices are implemented in a uniform way across the organization. Implementation of backups should be included as part of deployable architectures, with backup configuration kept close to provisioning code to ensure easier adjustment as information system changes occur. Backup accounts should be created and configured as code, with each BU account group including a separate backup account and an additional backup account used for centralized accounts. If you are using Cloud Object Storage for backup, at minimum, use separate buckets for backing up different workload accounts and use separate backup credentials for each bucket where service to service policies are not possible. Use Cloud Object Storage versioning or immutable buckets for maximum security. Services that provide built-in backup facilities might have limitations regarding backup accounts. IBM Cloud Databases provide automatic daily backups that are stored in the same account and geography, typically in cross-regional storage, and should therefore be immune to a single region outage."}

However, with Network Function Virtualization (NFV), these services are packaged as virtual machines (VMs) on commodity hardware. This allows service providers to run their networks on standard servers instead of proprietary ones, reducing costs and increasing agility. The IBM Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller is used to configure and manage these VNFs, offering easy configuration, centralized management, and lower operational costs. The VNFs can also be integrated with IBM Cloud Schematics (Infrastructure as Code) and the IBM Content catalog to instantiate best-in-network solutions for workload management. The benefits of using VNFs include the ability to instantiate virtual network services and modify configurations without the need for new network hardware, rapid service delivery with the agility to scale above physical hardware, centralized policy control, and the use of the same routers, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs as in physical hardware or other cloud providers."}
