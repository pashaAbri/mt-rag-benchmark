If you are outdoors, move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. If you are in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. If trapped under debris, do not light a match, do not move about or kick up dust, cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing, tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you, and use a whistle if one is available.

"agent_response": "In California, the state's procurement process is managed by the Department of General Services (DGS). The DGS is responsible for providing a centralized location for the state's procurement of goods and services. They establish and maintain contracts for goods and services and provide procurement and contracting services to state departments and other eligible entities. California law requires that state agencies use DGS contracts whenever possible. The Office of General Services (OGS) also plays a role in the state's procurement process by providing centralized statewide contracts for commodity services, service contracts, and technology services.\n\nThe state of California has a strong emphasis on inclusivity and diversity in its procurement process, providing opportunities for small businesses (SBs), disabled veteran enterprises (DVBEs), and other businesses covered by state programs. The Military Department encourages prospective contractors and vendors to consider these programs and preferences.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific requirements and guidelines for state procurement can vary depending on the program or organization. Therefore, it's always a good idea to check the specific guidelines or contact the relevant organization for the most accurate information.\n\nFor federal procurement, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has its own procurement regulations, including the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and the VA Acquisition Regulations (VAAR), which are supplements to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The VA also has a construction and facilities management division that provides a wide variety of services and expertise to VA to deliver high-quality and cost-effective facilities in support of Veterans."}

And what\u2019s going to happen to it? Remember, too: never share your Social Security number with someone who reaches out to you.\n\n3. Unsubscribe from unwanted emails: Getting fewer unwanted emails helps you avoid clicking on links that can lead to a phishing attack. However, be cautious as unsubscribing can sometimes confirm a \"real\" recipient to a scammer who can share your address and increase targeting for phishing.\n\n4. Report unwanted messages: Unwanted messages often lead to scams. Report them.\n\n5. Never click on links in a spam email, even if it says \"unsubscribe here\". Always report the offending email to the ISP.\n\n6. Be wary of spam texts that arrive as MMS, requiring you to download it to read. Do not download any MMS from unknown numbers.\n\n7.

mortgage loan modification scams, are common schemes where scammers take advantage of individuals struggling to pay their mortgages. These scammers may ask for money upfront and claim to guarantee that they can change the terms of your mortgage, often making false promises of saving you from foreclosure. If you're having trouble making mortgage payments, it's essential to know that HUD-approved housing counseling agencies can walk you through your options for free.\n\nTo avoid mortgage scams, be cautious of companies that:\n\n1. Ask for money upfront before providing services.\n2. Guarantee to stop a foreclosure or change the terms of your mortgage.\n3. Ask you to sign over the deed to your property or transfer ownership.\n4. Pressure you to sign paperwork quickly without allowing time to read it or consult a lawyer.\n\nIf you're a victim of a mortgage scam, consider the following steps to report it:\n\n1. Report the scam to your state Attorney General's office.\n2. Submit a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov.\n3.

Test results are reported as \"Detected\" or \"Not Detected\" for CWD and other prion diseases. That means we can be certain an animal is positive for CWD if the prions are \"detected\" but we cannot be certain the animal did not have CWD if the results are \"not detected.\" This is one of the major issues surrounding CWD and other prion diseases and is in large part because of the attributes of the pathogen itself (the prion) and the sensitivities of the currently available tests.\n\nIn summary, the decision to consume game meat should be made with caution and awareness of any potential disease risks in the area where the animal was hunted.

as ash, into the lower atmosphere. Volcanic ash can cause major disruptions to air traffic, render lands around the volcano unusable for decades, be a major irritant to human health, and cause structures to fail due to the weight of the ash. Sulfur dioxide can react with other substances to produce sulfate aerosol, which can scatter light and reflect sunlight back into space, cooling the Earth's surface. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, for example, caused global temperatures to abruptly dip by about a half-degree for about two years. However, the amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is extremely small compared to human emissions. On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, while people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005). As a result, human activity overshadows any contribution volcanoes may have made to recent global warming.\n\nReferences:\n- Global Warming\n- Aerosols: Tiny Particles, Big Impact"}

The best solution is to prevent contamination in the first place by properly disposing of harmful products. If groundwater is already contaminated, it can be cleaned up, but the process is time-consuming and expensive. Communities have spent millions of dollars to remove contaminants from their water supply. Here are some tips for proper disposal of household hazardous waste:\n\n1. Purchase only what you need.\n2. Use products completely before disposing of them.\n3. Recycle whatever you can, such as oil, batteries, and surplus paints.\n4. Do not dump products onto the ground, pour them into the street, or put hazardous or toxic products in the trash.\n5. Pour products down the drain only if the label says it's safe to do so.\n\nYou can view proper disposal of Household Hazardous Wastes online for more information."}

assistance available for property taxes for homeowners in California.

You could increase the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected. This would encourage players to explore and collect as many samples as possible.\n\n2. **Add hazards:** Space travel and other worlds are fraught with hazards. From steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly. You can program your game to include hazards that players need to avoid. This would add an element of challenge and excitement to the game.\n\n3. **Add a countdown timer:** NASA's missions to Mars and other destinations have a planned life expectancy. You can create a timer that counts down to the end of the mission and ends the game. This would add a sense of urgency and pressure, making the game more engaging.\n\n4. **Add landing code:** Every Mars rover has to first land on the Red Planet before it can start exploring. You can specify a landing site by creating scripts that place the rover at a certain location at the beginning of the game. This could be made more exciting by making the landing site random or within a smaller section of the backdrop image.\n\n5. **Add hidden hazards:** Make some hazards hidden and some visible. This would require players to be more vigilant and strategic, increasing the game's difficulty and engagement.\n\n6. **Make the rover move diagonally:** This would make the game more realistic and challenging.\n\nRemember, the key to making the game interesting is to strike a balance between challenge and playability. The game should be difficult enough to be engaging, but not so hard that it becomes frustrating or unenjoyable."}

With the rover sprite selected, you can start creating the code that manages the game and controls the rover.\n\nYou can make the rover move up, down, left, and right on the screen using four different keys on the keyboard. You can specify how far the rover will move each time one of those keys is pressed and make the rover rotate so it points in the direction of travel. You can also make the rover move diagonally using keys other than the keys already assigned as a bonus.\n\nFurthermore, you can add sample tubes for collection by placing the downloaded sample tube sprites to the backdrop. Make the sample tube sprites disappear when they are visited by the rover and reappear when players click the green flag to restart the game.\n\nAdditionally, you can add a countdown timer that counts down to the end of the mission and ends the game, and a scoring system that includes points earned for collecting sample tubes.\n\nThese are the basic steps to script the sprite in your Mars Sample Collection Video Game project.

She secured more than $7.5 billion for New York from those who broke state laws and took advantage of New Yorkers. She helped remove more than 4,000 guns from New York communities, took down dangerous drug and gun trafficking rings, and took legal action to stop the proliferation of ghost guns.\n\nAttorney General James also took on predatory landlords who harassed tenants and endangered children by violating New York's lead paint laws. She protected New Yorkers' health and the state's natural resources by going after polluters and companies that flouted environmental protection laws. She stood up for vulnerable populations by going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop a question about citizenship from being added to the census and successfully protecting DACA.\n\nPrior to serving as Attorney General, Letitia James held various public service positions, including serving as the public advocate for the City of New York, representing the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council, and head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office. She began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society.\n\nAttorney General James is a proud Brooklynite and a graduate of Lehman College and Howard University School of Law. She has been a national leader in the fight to defend access to reproductive health care, leading dozens of legal actions across the country to protect and expand access to this lifesaving care. She has also stood up against corruption and taken strong action against officials who broke New York laws or workplace protection measures, regardless of their status or political affiliation."}

Similarly, Government Code Section 12653 prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee for making lawful acts in disclosing information to a government agency.\n\nHowever, you should be aware that these laws do not protect you if you break the confidentiality of the lawyer-client privilege or reveal a trade secret. You should not reveal any privileged information or disclose any trade secrets.\n\nAdditionally, you should determine if your employer has set up internal procedures to handle whistleblower claims. If so, you should review these procedures to figure out how to proceed. If you face retaliation, you may have to dedicate your personal time and money to hire an attorney to file a lawsuit.\n\nIf you are a whistleblower in the context of a false claims act, such as the New York False Claims Act, you may be eligible for a share of the sums recovered as a result of the action you file. Whistleblowers are often represented by private lawyers who can ensure that their clients\u2019 rights are protected.\n\nIn all cases, it is important to consult with a legal professional before taking any action to ensure that you are fully informed of your rights and the relevant legal procedures."}

This collision excavated material from the comet's interior, which was then studied by the flyby bus using imaging cameras and infrared spectrometers.\n\nThe mission's primary scientific objectives were to improve our understanding of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei, determine the properties of the surface layers and the composition of the comet's interior, and study the relationship between the surface and the interior of the comet.\n\nAfter the primary mission, Deep Impact was renamed EPOXI and embarked on an extended mission that included a flyby of comet Hartley 2 and observations of extrasolar planets. The spacecraft was equipped with a high-resolution camera, a medium-resolution camera, and an infrared spectrometer to study the composition and structure of the comets it encountered. The mission helped scientists learn more about the formation and evolution of comets and the origins of the solar system."}

Comets are large, icy bodies that orbit the Sun. They are made up of a solid, frozen core called the nucleus, which is typically a few kilometers in size and contains dust and ice.

The gases and dust streaming away from the nucleus form a tail that can stretch millions of miles behind the comet. Comets are believed to be leftovers from the formation of the solar system, and they may provide valuable insights into the conditions that existed when the Sun and planets were first formed. They can be found in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, which are regions beyond the orbit of Neptune and far beyond the Kuiper Belt, respectively.

Here are the four steps for composting at home:\n\n1. **Pick Out A Bin**: Ensure your bin is at least 3x3x3 feet in size. The location of your bin (sunny vs. shady) will impact how fast your compost will dry out or hold water. A closed bin, like a tumbler, is the only way to ensure you will keep critters out while also keeping out microbes needed to break down your waste. If you use a closed bin, make sure to add a shovel full of soil from the ground. Place your bin somewhere convenient to use and access, and consider having a hose within reach if weather is dry. Pallets make great open compost bins and are free if you can get a hold of them. If you make your own closed bin with a vessel like a garbage can, you will need to drill holes to allow oxygen exchange.\n\n2. **Gather Materials**: Materials that go in your compost can be described as brown or green. Browns are higher in carbon, while greens have a higher nitrogen to carbon ratio. The optimal ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. This ratio does not have to be exact but will generally achieve the best results. Avoid adding feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter. Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink. If you can't have the bowl inside a cabinet, get a container with a lid to help minimize fruit flies and pests. Browns include leaves, vegetable scraps, straw, coffee grounds, wood chips, alfalfa, sawdust, grass clippings, newspaper, manure (herbivores only), cardboard, and garden waste.\n\n3. **Maintain**: If you have an open bin, layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom to help with air and drainage when starting. Layer your browns and greens, imagining you are making a bowl for your greens to lay in the middle and then adding more browns on top.

To get a civil harassment restraining order, you will need to complete a few court forms, including one that asks you to describe in detail the harassment, stalking, threats, or harm you experienced. If you want help with these forms, you can contact your local Self-Help Center.\n\nAfter filing the necessary forms, a judge will make a decision on whether to grant you temporary protection within a day or two. If the judge grants your request, they will issue a temporary restraining order, which will last until your court hearing. At the court hearing, the judge will decide whether to issue a permanent restraining order, which can last up to five years.\n\nIt is important to note that you cannot get a civil harassment restraining order against someone who is closely related to you, such as a spouse, parent, sibling, or child. In such cases, you would need to file for a different type of restraining order, such as a domestic violence restraining order."}
