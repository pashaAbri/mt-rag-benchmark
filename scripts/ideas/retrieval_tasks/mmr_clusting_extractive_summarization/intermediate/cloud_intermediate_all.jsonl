For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the `firstname` is \"Charles\" and the `surname` is \"Dickens\":\n```json\n{\n  \"selector\": {\n    \"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n    \"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n  },\n  \"limit\": 10\n}\n```\nTo create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query, you can call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body. For example, to create an index for the `firstname` and `surname` fields, you can use the following JSON index definition:\n```json\n{\n  \"index\": {\n    \"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n  },\n  \"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\"\n}\n```\nIf you need to access objects within documents, you can use standard dot notation for example, `address.zipcode` to access a postal code string inside an `address` object. Additionally, you can specify the `fields`, `sort`, and `limit` parameters to define the document attributes you want returned, how the data is to be sorted, and the number of documents to return.\n\nIf you are from a relational database background, you can think of the `WHERE` clause as the equivalent of the `selector` in IBM Cloudant Query, `ORDER` as the equivalent of `sort`, and `LIMIT` as the equivalent of `limit`. The IBM Cloudant Query `FIELDS` list is equivalent to the comma-separated list of attributes after the `SELECT` keyword in an SQL query."}

Make sure you have the Manager role at the account level to add or remove namespaces. You can check your access roles in [Access roles for configuring Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamaccess_roles_configure).\n2. Namespaces must be unique across all IBM Cloud accounts in the same region, have 4-30 characters, start and end with a letter or number, and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Do not put personal information in your namespace names.\n3. You can create namespaces using the IBM Cloud console or the IBM Cloud CLI. To create a namespace in the IBM Cloud console, navigate to the IBM Cloud Container Registry page and click 'Create namespace.' To create a namespace using the IBM Cloud CLI, run the command `ibmcloud cr namespace-add <namespace_name>`, replacing `<namespace_name>` with the desired unique namespace name.\n\nNamespaces allow you to divide up cluster resources and set resource quotas, default limits, and RBAC policies to control access. For more information on working with namespaces, you can refer to the documentation on [Managing namespaces](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-namespaces)."}

This feature helps IBM Cloud support customers better and provides Red Hat insights into cluster impacts from product upgrades.\n\nYou can deploy the INGEST app with IBM Cloudant at each regional cluster for storing researchers' rich data documents, which can be queried and processed as needed. The anonymized data can then be synced across regional clusters or shipped to a centralized data store for processing using ML like PyTorch on bare metal worker nodes that provide GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management helps control who has access to the resources, while Vulnerability Advisor provides image vulnerability scans and policy scans based on ISO 27k for app security. Developers can focus on domain problems by using existing tools and binding IBM Cloud services to clusters, freeing them from infrastructure management tasks."}

It is used in the context of IBM Cloud services, such as Text to Speech and Speech to Text, to send two types of parameters: query parameters and message parameters.\n\nQuery parameters are sent when phone integration connects to the service and can include parameters such as model, acoustic\\_customization\\_id, version, x-watson-learning-opt-out, base\\_model\\_version, and language\\_customization\\_id.\n\nMessage parameters, on the other hand, are sent as part of the JSON data in the request body. For example, in the Text to Speech service, the synthesize parameter is used to specify the Text to Speech service configuration when synthesizing audio. The update\\_strategy parameter is also a message parameter and is used to specify the update strategy for the speech configuration.\n\nSimilarly, in the Speech to Text service, narrowband\\_recognize and broadband\\_recognize parameters reflect the parameters that are made available by the Speech to Text WebSocket interface.\n\nWebSocket API allows the client to continue to use the connection to send further recognition requests with new audio. By default, the service continues to use the parameters that were sent with the previous start message for all subsequent requests that are sent over the same connection. To change the parameters for subsequent requests, the client can send another start message with the new parameters after it receives the final recognition results and a new {\"state\":\"listening\"} message from the service.\n\nWebSocket API also allows the client to define the following query parameters for the phone integration's connection to the Speech to Text service, such as model, acoustic\\_customization\\_id, version, x-watson-learning-opt-out, base\\_model\\_version, and language\\_customization\\_id.\n\nIn summary, WebSocket API allows sending two types of parameters in real-time communication between a client and a server, and it allows the client to continue to use the connection to send further requests with new audio, change parameters for subsequent requests, and define specific query parameters for the phone integration's connection to the Speech to Text service."}

The process of configuring backup support may vary depending on the provider and your specific setup. For Watson Assistant, you can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. You can specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. If the connection to a live agent fails after transferring the call, you can configure what message to stream to callers and whether to disconnect the call or process a different dialog node. In case of a disaster recovery scenario, the phone integration supports fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider.\n\nHowever, if you decide to use third-party providers, you may need to review their documentation and contact their support for specific instructions on how to configure and integrate their services with your existing system and Watson Assistant. Keep in mind that additional costs and time may be involved in setting up and maintaining the integration of third-party services."}

These ongoing improvements aim to enhance data protection, privacy, and system resilience.\n\nIn the context of restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC, the security protocols could impact several aspects such as data encryption, access control, and network security.\n\n1. Data Encryption: With advancements in encryption techniques, the security of backup data, including snapshots, can be strengthened. For instance, if a backup snapshot is not encrypted with a customer key, the encryption of the copy remains provider-managed. However, if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-managed key, a specified key must be used to encrypt the new copy.\n\n2. Access Control: Security protocols may also influence how access to backup snapshots and restored volumes is managed. This could involve more granular control over who can create, modify, or delete backups, as well as who can restore volumes.\n\n3. Network Security: As cloud computing security protocols evolve, there may be enhancements in network security measures for backup snapshots and restored volumes.

Cloud:\n\n1. **Fixed charges**: These are charges based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that does not change, regardless of usage. An example of a fixed charge is the monthly fee for a subscription service.\n\n2. **Metered charges**: These are charges based on the amount of usage of a service. For example, metered charges for compute resources might be based on the number of GB hours consumed for runtimes, while metered charges for containers might be based on the number of IP addresses and storage consumed.\n\n3. **Tiered charges**: These are charges that offer volume-based discounts according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans, with different prices for different usage levels. For example, a service might offer a lower price per GB hour for usage levels above a certain threshold.\n\n4. **Reserved charges**: These are charges for services that are reserved in advance for long-term usage. By reserving a service in advance, users can get a discounted price compared to on-demand pricing. An example of a reserved charge is the cost for reserving a large Db2 on Cloud service for 12 months in advance.\n\nIt's worth noting that IBM Cloud also offers other types of charges, such as In Advance and In Arrears charges. In Advance charges are recurring charges for infrastructure monthly usage that you incur until you cancel the service, while In Arrears charges are usage-based charges from the previous month, typically for infrastructure hourly usage. Additionally, third-party services you use but signed up for outside of IBM Cloud do not bill for their service through IBM Cloud, and some IBM Cloud services might provide a free allocation before the start of your billing period."}

Then, you can send a DELETE request to the appropriate URL for your instance, including the customer_id and version in the request. The delete requests are processed in batches and may take up to 24 hours to complete.\n\nHere's an example of how to send the DELETE request using cURL:\n\ncurl -X DELETE -u \"apikey:3Df... ...Y7Pc9\" \"{url}/v2/user\\_data?customer\\_id=abc&version=2020-04-01\"\n\nAn empty JSON object {} is returned once the deletion is successful.\n\nPlease note that only data that was added by using the POST /message API endpoint with an associated customer ID can be deleted using this delete method. Data that was added by other methods cannot be deleted based on customer ID. Also, specifying a customer\\_id will delete all messages with that customer\\_id that were received before the delete request, across your entire Watson Assistant instance, not just within one skill.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the API reference: https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2deleteuserdata."}

applications in the event of a disaster or outage. For databases, IBM provides Geo-Replicated Disaster Recovery (DR) using Db2 HADR technology. This allows you to add a DR node in an offsite data center and failover to it in the event of a disaster. However, failover is not automatic and must be initiated by the user. DR nodes are currently available for Enterprise and Standard HADR plans, and not for single node plans or EU-Cloud.\n\nFor Hyper Protect Crypto Services, disaster recovery includes the provision of disaster recovery sites, provisioning disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events. IBM is responsible for the recovery of Hyper Protect Crypto Services components, while you are responsible for the recovery of the workloads that run Hyper Protect Crypto Services and your application data.\n\nIn case of a regional disaster, you can restore your data by using failover crypto units, which automatically backs up operational crypto units and keystores in another region. Alternatively, you can use the default daily backup to restore your data by opening a support ticket and manually loading your master key to the new instance again.\n\nIt is important to note that failover crypto units must be initialized and configured the same as the operational crypto units before the disaster happens to be able to use them to restore data in a regional disaster."}

dictionary-based, rule-based, and machine learning pre-annotators. The choice of pre-annotator depends on the specific requirements of your project. For fields with unique or specialized terminology, dictionary pre-annotators can be helpful, while machine learning pre-annotators can be a better choice for documents with complex structures and context-dependent entities.\n\nRegarding combining pre-annotators, it is possible to run multiple pre-annotators on the same set of documents, but it's essential to consider that pre-annotators may produce conflicting annotations. Therefore, it's necessary to have a strategy for resolving these conflicts.\n\nAs for the tools for conversational and technical documents, Knowledge Studio supports various pre-annotation tools that cater to different document types. Generally, the Smart Document Understanding (SDU) tool is used for Document Retrieval for Contracts projects, while a pretrained SDU model is applied automatically for these projects. However, the SDU tool is rarely used with Content Mining projects.\n\nThe SDU tool can annotate various file types, such as image files, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, and PDF files.
