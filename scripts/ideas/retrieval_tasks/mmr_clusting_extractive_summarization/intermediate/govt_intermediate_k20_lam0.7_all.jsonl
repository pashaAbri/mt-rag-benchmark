the amount of easily recyclable and compostable materials deposited in landfills from businesses, institutions, single-family and multi-family properties, and self-haulers. These ordinances aim to help the state reach the long-term goal of reducing waste by ensuring that 75% of recyclables and compostables are diverted from the landfill by 2025.\n\nThe Organics Reduction and Recycling Ordinance, which went into effect on January 1, 2022, requires all generators of compostable and recyclable materials (including residents, businesses, schools, and multi-family properties) to sort materials into the appropriate containers. Businesses, nonprofits, institutions, schools, and multi-family properties must subscribe to compost (organics) and recycling collection service, place color-coded labeled recycling and compost bins next to all garbage bins, sort materials into the proper bins, and inform employees, tenants, and contractors of the rules. Violation of this ordinance may result in a fine for an infraction.\n\nThe Mandatory Commercial Recycling law, in effect since July 1, 2012, requires businesses and institutions with 4 or more cubic yards of garbage service, as well as multi-family properties with 5 or more units, to recycle. Phase 2 of the Mandatory Recycling Ordinance began on July 1, 2015, for all commercial accounts.\n\nThe Plant Debris Landfill Ban Ordinance applies to certain businesses and institutions and requires plant debris to be separated and composted. Alameda County law prohibits disposal of plant debris in county landfills, and this ordinance requires landscape professionals, residents, and businesses to separate all plant debris from garbage. Violation of this ordinance may result in a fine for an infraction.\n\nFor self-haulers, improper facility use fines can be imposed if they do not abide by the organic waste requirements as laid out by the State of California. The penalties imposed by any jurisdiction are based on Government Code Sections 53069.4, 25132, and 36900 and are as follows:\n- First violation: $"}

piece of the virus, which then triggers an immune response. This response helps our bodies to recognize and fight the virus if we are exposed to it in the future. The two main types of COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) and viral vector vaccines (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen).\n\nmRNA vaccines contain a small piece of the virus's mRNA, which our cells use to produce a harmless piece of the virus. Our bodies then recognize this piece as foreign and create an immune response. The mRNA is quickly broken down and eliminated by our bodies, and it does not affect our DNA.\n\nViral vector vaccines, on the other hand, use a harmless virus to deliver a small piece of the virus's DNA into our cells. Our cells then use this DNA to produce a harmless piece of the virus, which triggers an immune response. The viral vector is not harmful and does not replicate, but it helps to teach our bodies how to recognize and fight the virus.\n\nBoth types of vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. According to the New York State Department of Health, the effectiveness of the FDA-approved and -authorized vaccines remains strong even against newer strains, including against variants. Those who are unvaccinated have the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill, which is why it is important to get vaccinated as soon as possible."}

Protect your personal information: Before you enter personal information on a website, email, or text chain, stop. Ask yourself: Why do they need this information? And what\u2019s going to happen to it? Remember, too: never share your Social Security number with someone who reaches out to you.\n\n3. Unsubscribe from unwanted emails: Getting fewer unwanted emails helps you avoid clicking on links that can lead to a phishing attack. However, be cautious as unsubscribing from certain spam emails might confirm to scammers that your email address is active and result in more spam.\n\n4. Report unwanted messages: Unwanted messages often lead to scams. Report them to the Internet Service Provider (ISP).\n\n5. Do not click on any links in a spam email, even if it says \"unsubscribe here\". Always report the offending email to the ISP.\n\n6. Be wary of MMS texts from unknown numbers, as you might not be able to forward them to 7726 (the spam reporting number) and you should not download any MMS from unknown numbers.\n\n7. Consider using script blockers and blocking third-party links and cookies on sites you trust.\n\n8. Never answer a phone call from a number you don't recognize, as it's usually a telemarketer."}

some of the most common scams and frauds:\n\n1. Foreclosure relief and mortgage loan modification scams: These scammers may ask for money upfront and claim to guarantee that you can get your mortgage terms changed.\n\n2. Identity theft: This occurs when someone steals your identity to commit fraud, such as using your personal information without your permission.\n\n3. Imposter scams: Imposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization.\n\n4. Mail fraud: Mail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n5. Phishing: In phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information.\n\n6. Wire or money transfer fraud: Some scammers trick you into wiring or transferring money to steal from you. A common example of a wire transfer fraud is the \u201cgrandparent scam.\u201d\n\n7.

"Volcanoes can contribute to climate change through the release of gases and particles. When volcanoes erupt, they can emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, water, and sulfur dioxide, which can impact the climate. Sulfur dioxide, in particular, can react with other substances to produce sulfate aerosol, which can scatter light and cool the global climate for a couple of years following a major eruption.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is relatively small compared to human emissions. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release approximately 100 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year than volcanoes.\n\nWhile natural influences on temperature, such as volcanic eruptions, have varied approximately plus or minus 0.2\u00b0 C (0.4\u00b0 F) in the past 120 years, human influences have contributed roughly 0.8\u00b0 C (1\u00b0 F) of warming since 1889. This means that human influence on climate has eclipsed the magnitude of natural temperature changes in recent times."}

This contamination often occurs when harmful products, such as household cleaners, pesticides, motor oil, and antifreeze, are disposed of improperly and seep into the groundwater supply. In the context of Monterey Park, CA, groundwater contamination is a significant concern because 100% of the water served to residents and businesses comes from groundwater. While contaminated groundwater can be cleaned up, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is essential to prevent contamination by disposing of harmful products properly.\n\nThe City of Monterey Park Water System receives its water supply from one source, which is local groundwater.

you are a whistleblower, you can report unsafe conditions confidentially to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) by calling the whistleblower hotline at 1-800-649-7570 or filing a complaint online. The PUC will keep your identity private if you request it. If you are a federal civilian employee, you can also report wrongdoing to your supervisor, the agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG), or the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). You can confidentially report information about violations of any law, rule, or regulation, mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. If you are concerned about retaliation, California Labor Code Section 1102.5(b) protects you from retaliation by your employer if you have reasonable cause to believe that the information reveals a violation of or noncompliance with state or federal statute, rule, or regulation. Government Code Section 12653 also prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee because of lawful acts in disclosing information to a government agency. However, you are not protected from retaliation if you break the confidentiality of the lawyer-client privilege or reveal a trade secret. Additionally, whistleblower laws generally do not protect you when your claims involve personal matters rather than public concern. If you need legal assistance, you may have to hire an attorney to file a lawsuit for retaliation, as these laws do not prevent you from facing the risk of retaliation."}

Determine the amount of child support: You can contact an attorney or the California Department of Child Support Services to determine the amount of child support payable under the California State Child Support Guideline. \n\n2. File a petition: If there is no existing case, you need to file a petition. If you are married to the other parent, you may file a petition for divorce, legal separation, or nullity. If you are not married to the other parent, you may file a petition to establish parental relationship. A parentage action can be filed by either the mother or father. If you file a parentage action yourself, you can request orders for custody and visitation as well as child support. \n\n3. Request a hearing: You can file a Request for Order to ask for child support order(s) when filing a petition to establish a parental relationship, or for divorce, legal separation or nullity, or after a case has been opened. You can also ask for modification of an existing order for support or to stop a child support order after the child has emancipated.\n\n4. Serve the Department of Child Support Services: If the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) is a party on your case, a copy will be collected by the Court and served on the DCSS. Provide an extra set of copies of your documents to the clerk for this purpose.\n\n5. Serve the other parent: You must serve the other parent with endorsed filed copies of the court forms at least 21 days before your hearing (or sooner if the judge says so). This includes Request for Order (Form FL-300), Temporary Orders (if you filed one) (Form FL-305), Declaration in Support of Ex Parte Declaration for Orders (if you asked for temporary orders), a blank Responsive Declaration to Request for Order (Form FL-320). The person who serves the papers must complete a \"Proof of Personal Service\" (Form FL-330).\n\n6. File the Proof of Service: Once the other party has been properly served, and you do not have a child custody agreement with the other parent, mediation is mandatory.

The mission involved sending a spacecraft to rendezvous with the comet and launching a projectile into its nucleus to observe the ejecta and crater formation process.\n\nThe spacecraft consisted of a flyby bus and a cylindrical copper impactor, and was equipped with high- and medium-resolution imaging cameras and infrared spectrometers to observe the ejected ice and dust. The impactor was made primarily of copper and had a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting.\n\nThe mission's scientific objectives were to improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus, determine properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the crater and its formation, study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact, and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched on January 12, 2005, and successfully observed the comet Tempel 1 in July of the same year. During the encounter, the spacecraft reoriented itself to protect against dust damage, and then returned images and data to Earth. The mission ended in August 2005, with a total budget of $240 million.\n\nThe Deep Impact mission was followed by an extended mission called EPOXI, which involved flying by comet Hartley 2 and observing nearby bright stars with known large planets to characterize their planets. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on November 4, 2010, and the extended mission ended in July 2008."}

Comets are icy bodies that originate from the outer regions of the solar system. When they come close to the Sun, they heat up and begin to emit gas and dust, creating a glowing coma and sometimes also a tail. Comets are important objects of study in astronomy because they are thought to contain some of the most primitive material in the solar system, and therefore can provide clues about the conditions that existed when the Sun and planets formed.\n\nSome comets have short-period orbits, meaning they orbit the Sun with periods of less than 200 years, while others have long-period orbits and may take thousands of years to complete a single orbit. Comet Tempel 1, which was the target of the Deep Impact mission, is an example of a short-period comet, with an orbital period of 5.5 years. Comet Hartley 2, on the other hand, has an orbital period of 6.5 years and was the target of the EPOXI mission.\n\nComets can also provide information about the structure and evolution of the solar system. For example, by studying the orbits of comets, astronomers can learn about the distribution of mass in the outer solar system and the history of the planetary migration. By analyzing the composition of cometary material, scientists can also learn about the chemical processes that occurred during the formation of the solar system.\n\nOverall, the study of comets is an important area of research in astronomy and space science, with potential to shed light on the origins and evolution of the solar system."}

mission.\n\nThe NASA Discovery Program is a series of frequent, highly focused, cost-effective missions that answer critical questions in solar system science. It was formally started in NASA's FY 1994 budget and features small planetary exploration spacecraft with focused science goals that can be built in 36 months or less, and for less than $190 million in development costs. The program has expanded since then, but still concentrates on smaller missions that require less resources and shorter development times than the larger \"flagship\" missions. The program encourages the use of new technologies, transfer of these technologies to the private sector, increased participation of small and disadvantaged businesses, the pursuit of innovative ways of doing business, and support of the nation's educational initiatives.\n\nSeventeen missions have been selected for the Discovery program so far, including Lunar Prospector, Mars Pathfinder, Stardust, Deep Impact, MESSENGER, Dawn, Kepler, and InSight. These missions have made significant contributions to our understanding of the solar system, including studies of the Moon, Mars, asteroids, comets, Mercury, and exoplanets.\n\nTwo of the most recent missions selected as part of the Discovery Program are DAVINCI+ and VERITAS, both of which are planned to launch in 2028-2030. DAVINCI+ is a Venus orbiter and atmospheric probe mission, while VERITAS is a Venus orbiter mission designed to map the planet's surface and determine its geological history.\n\nThe Discovery Program conducts space science investigations in the Planetary Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, and provides frequent opportunities for principal investigator-led investigations in planetary sciences that can be accomplished under a not-to-exceed cost cap."}

Closed bins are recommended to keep critters out and to maintain the presence of beneficial microbes needed for decomposition. If you make your own closed bin, drill holes for oxygen exchange.\n\nStep 2: Gather Materials - Collect materials to compost and categorize them as 'browns' (higher in carbon) or 'greens' (higher in nitrogen). A common ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Examples of brown materials include leaves, straw, wood chips, and cardboard. Greens include vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and grass clippings. Avoid materials like feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, and non-organic matter.\n\nStep 3: Maintain - If you have an open bin, layer small sticks and twigs at the bottom for air and drainage. Layer browns and greens, with greens in the middle and more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, and turn it to encourage decomposition and oxygen presence.\n\nStep 4: Harvest and More! - When the compost has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil, it is ready. If you don't fully turn the pile, the finished compost will be at the bottom. If you run out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel and toilet paper rolls can be used as additions.\n\nAdditional resources for composting at home can be found at www.compost.css.cornell.edu, www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home, and www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8799.html.\n\nFor more information on composting methods, you can refer to the US EPA's Approaches to Composting document. Different methods include passive aeration, static pile with active aeration, windrow, and vermicomposting"}

Bicyclists should yield to other non-motorized trail users, unless the trail is clearly signed for bike-only travel. Bicyclists traveling downhill should yield to ones headed uphill, unless the trail is clearly signed for one-way or downhill-only traffic.\n7. In general, strive to respect everyone you meet on the trail.\n8. Never Scare Animals: respect wildlife and wildlife habitat. Animals are easily startled by an unannounced approach, a sudden movement or a loud noise. Give animals enough room and time to adjust to you. When passing horses, use special care and follow directions from the horseback riders (ask if uncertain).\n9. Plan Ahead: know your equipment, your ability and the area in which you are riding and prepare accordingly. Strive to be self-sufficient: keep your equipment in good repair. Carry necessary supplies for changes in weather or other conditions. Always wear a helmet and appropriate safety gear.\n10.
