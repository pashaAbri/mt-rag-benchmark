queries on your databases. To use IBM Cloudant Query, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the service instance that you created in the prerequisite section.\n2. Open the database that you want to query.\n3. Go to the Query tab.\n4. Paste the query JSON into the Cloudant Query window. This JSON should include the index definition and the selector, which specifies the query criteria.\n5. Click Run Query. The results will be displayed in a table, which includes columns for each field in the selector, as well as the document's _id.\n\nIt's important to note that IBM Cloudant Query requires indexing, which can be created manually or automatically. If an index is not found that matches the specified query, IBM Cloudant Query uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. However, full table scans are expensive to process, so it is recommended that you create an index for better performance.\n\nFor example, to create an index on the publisher and year fields, you can use the following JSON definition:\n```json\n{\n  \"index\": {\n    \"fields\": [\n      \"publisher\", \"year\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"name\": \"publisher-year-index\",\n  \"type\": \"json\"\n}\n```\nAfter creating the index, you can include the index name in the query JSON to use it for that query.\n\nYou can also use the IBM Cloudant Query documentation for more information and examples on how to use IBM Cloudant Query."}

The IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry is a managed service provided by IBM that allows you to store and manage container images in a private, multi-tenant registry.

If you're unsure whether a namespace is already set for your account, run the `ibmcloud cr namespace-list` command with the `-v` option to retrieve existing namespace information.\n4. Set up multiple namespaces for separate repositories in different environments or regions, as needed. Ensure that namespace names are unique within regions.\n5. Set proper RBAC policies to control access when making new namespaces.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the IBM Cloud Container Registry documentation on managing namespaces (<https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_namespaces>)."}

deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. It can be used to set up clusters in various ways, including single zone clusters and clusters with public network connectivity.\n\nSingle zone clusters can be created in one of the supported single zone locations, and to improve availability for your app, you can add additional worker nodes to the cluster. VPC clusters are supported only in multizone metro locations, but if your cluster must reside in a single zone city, you can create a classic cluster instead.\n\nClusters with public network connectivity are multiple clusters set up across zones or regions and connected via a global load balancer.\n\nYou can add more worker nodes to your cluster by resizing an existing worker pool or by adding a new worker pool. When you add more worker nodes, app instances can be distributed across multiple worker nodes. If one worker node goes down, app instances on available worker nodes continue to run, and Red Hat OpenShift automatically reschedules pods from unavailable worker nodes to ensure performance and capacity for your app.\n\nTo get more detailed information about IBM Cloud and Red Hat OpenShift, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation and the official Red Hat OpenShift documentation."}

The SIP trunk must also be configured to use only Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n   Note: If you use Twilio as your SIP trunk provider, you cannot enable SIP authentication for outbound SIP trunks to Watson Assistant. If you're using a Lite or Trial Twilio account for testing purposes, you should verify the transfer target.\n\n2. To optimize your actions for phone interaction:\n   - Do not include HTML elements in your action responses. To add formatting, use Markdown.\n   - You can use a search extension to include search results in actions that the phone integration will read. When search results are returned, the phone integration reads the introductory message and then the body of only the first search result.\n   - Ensure the entire search response (introductory message plus the body of the first search result) must be less than 5,000 characters long or the response will not be read at all.\n   - Test the search results that are returned and curate the data collection that you use as necessary.\n\nIf you need assistance setting up an account with another SIP trunk provider, open a support request and IBM will assist you. IBM has established relationships with Five9, Genesys, Vonage, and Voximplant. The SIP trunk provider will set up a SIP trunk for your voice traffic and manage access from allowed IP addresses.

third-party providers, you have the option to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region. In the event that all zones in a single region fail, calls can then be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\nAdditionally, Watson Assistant can handle call failures by accepting the call and transferring it to a configured default SIP URI, or by responding to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message during call setup. The SIP 500 INVITE error can then be used to redirect the call to another zone or region, providing a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider. This capability needs to be enabled for a specific Watson Assistant instance by making a request to IBM.\n\nFor more information on configuring backup support, you can refer to [Configuring backup support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phonedeploy-phone-transfer-service).\n\nIf you need help setting up an account with another SIP trunk provider, IBM can assist you as they have established relationships with Five9, Genesys, Vonage, and Voximplant. The SIP trunk provider will set up a SIP trunk for your voice traffic and manage access from allowed IP addresses. The network configuration required to support the SIP trunk connection can typically be handled for you with minimal effort."}

Limit the amount of personal information you share online. Avoid sharing sensitive data such as your full name, address, phone number, or financial information on social media or other public forums.\n2. Use strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. Consider using a password manager to help you generate and store complex passwords.\n3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your online accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or fingerprint, in addition to your password.\n4. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can contain malware that can compromise your privacy and security.\n5. Keep your software and operating system up to date. Regular updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.\n6. Use a virtual private network (VPN) when accessing the internet from public Wi-Fi networks. This helps to encrypt your internet connection and protect your data from being intercepted.\n7. Consider using a privacy-focused web browser or search engine that blocks third-party tracking and advertising cookies.\n8. Regularly review your social media privacy settings and adjust them as necessary. Limit the amount of information that is publicly visible and restrict access to your personal data.\n9. Be aware of phishing scams that attempt to trick you into providing your personal information.

However, restoring a volume from a backup or snapshot is a manual operation that takes time. The backup service does not provide continual backup with automatic failover. This means that while the backup service is secure and reliable, the restoration process may not be as swift, and could potentially impact recovery times in the event of a failure.\n\nSecondly, for best performance, you can enable snapshots for fast restore. This feature allows you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully provisioned when the volume is created.

models.\n\n* **Fixed:** Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted, regardless of usage. This means that you pay the same amount every month for a specific service or resource, regardless of how much you use it. This type of pricing is common for services that have predictable usage, such as a dedicated server or a fixed number of API calls.\n* **Metered:** Metered-usage pricing is based on the actual usage of a service or resource. You pay for what you use, usually on a per-unit basis, such as the number of GB hours consumed for runtimes or the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. This type of pricing is common for services that have variable usage, such as cloud computing resources or data storage.\n* **Tiered:** Tiered pricing is based on a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. In a simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. In a graduated tier model, the unit price per tier decreases as your level of usage increases. The total price is the cumulative charges for each level of usage, consisting of your quantity multiplied by the unit price at that tier. This type of pricing is common for services that have high quantities of usage per month, such as API calls or data transfer.\n* **Reserved:** Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. This type of pricing is common for services that require a predictable and consistent level of usage, such as databases, messaging systems, or machine learning models.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the differences between these pricing models!

Use the `ibmcloud ks cluster master update` command to start the update process. If you don't want to update the master to the default major.minor version, you can specify the latest patch version that is available for the major.minor version that you want.\n\n5. **Kubernetes Security Benchmarks**: Follow the CIS (Center for Internet Security) Kubernetes Benchmark, which provides specific security configuration steps for Kubernetes, designed to meet various industry regulations.

These features include securing the Kubernetes API server, etcd data store, worker node, network, storage, images, and deployments against malicious attacks. You can also leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect such attacks and suspicious usage patterns.\n\nAs for access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources. This is done through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies you assign to users depend on what you want them to be able to do. For more information on the types of access policies and how to assign them, see the provided documentation.\n\nIn terms of specific roles, the document suggests some examples for different use cases. For instance, for a user who needs to manage a cluster but not create or update pods, you might assign the \"Cluster Administrator\" role. For a user who needs to create and update pods, you might assign the \"Editor\" role. For a user who only needs to view resources and logs, you might assign the \"Viewer\" role.\n\nIt's also important to note that you can choose to register a Secrets Manager instance to your cluster during the cluster create process, and specify a secret group to control access to the secrets in your cluster. Data encryption with a key management service (KMS) can also be used to encrypt secrets and other sensitive information in your cluster."}

Obtain a custom domain from a domain registrar, for example, www.example.com.\n2. Obtain a signed SSL/TLS certificate for your custom domain from a public, trusted certificate authority (CA), along with a matching private key.\n3. In the IBM Cloud console, go to Manage > Account, and select Cloud Foundry orgs.\n4. Click the name of the org for which you're creating a custom domain.\n5.
