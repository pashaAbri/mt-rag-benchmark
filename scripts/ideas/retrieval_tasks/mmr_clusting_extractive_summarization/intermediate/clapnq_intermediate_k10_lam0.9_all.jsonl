Before becoming Chancellor, Brandt served as the Mayor of Berlin from 1957 to 1966. He was a strong critic of the Berlin Wall and led demonstrations against it. Brandt's contributions to world peace were recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.\n\nIn terms of specific actions, under Brandt's leadership, West Germany commenced Ostpolitik by negotiating nonaggression treaties with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. He also made a historic gesture of humility and penance by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during a visit to Warsaw in 1970. Brandt was forced to resign in 1974 after it was discovered that a senior member of his staff, G\u00fcnter Guillaume, was a spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi."}

disease, but it can cause serious complications in certain individuals. There are two types of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), with HSV-1 more commonly causing infections around the mouth and HSV-2 more commonly causing genital infections. Transmission can occur through direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual, even when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection and can be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses reside in nerve cell bodies for the lifespan of the individual. Recurrence may be triggered by decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure.\n\nHerpes is contracted through direct contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person. Herpes simplex virus 2 is typically contracted through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual but can also be contracted by exposure to infected saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, or the fluid from herpetic blisters. To infect a new individual, HSV travels through tiny breaks in the skin or mucous membranes in the mouth or genital areas. Even microscopic abrasions on mucous membranes are sufficient to allow viral entry. Infections caused by the herpes simplex virus include herpetic gingivostomatitis, herpes labialis, herpes genitalis, herpes whitlow, herpes gladiatorum, herpesviral encephalitis, herpesviral meningitis, and herpes esophagitis."}

the type of vaccine. Here are the basic methods for creating some common types of vaccines:\n\n1. Live-attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain weakened strains of the virus, which do not cause the disease but stimulate an immune response. These vaccines are made by growing the virus in cultures or cells under controlled conditions that reduce its virulence. Examples of live-attenuated vaccines include the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.\n\n2. Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain viruses or bacteria that have been killed using chemicals, heat, or radiation. These vaccines cannot cause the disease but can still stimulate an immune response. Examples of inactivated vaccines include the polio vaccine and the hepatitis A vaccine.\n\n3. Subunit vaccines: These vaccines contain only the parts of the virus or bacteria that stimulate an immune response. They are made by isolating and purifying the relevant antigens, such as the capsid proteins of the virus. Examples of subunit vaccines include the hepatitis B vaccine and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.\n\n4. Recombinant vaccines: These vaccines are made by using genetic engineering techniques to combine DNA from different sources. For example, a recombinant vaccine for hepatitis B is made by inserting a gene from the hepatitis B virus into a yeast or bacterial cell, which then produces the viral antigen.\n\n5. Conjugate vaccines: These vaccines are made by linking a protein or carbohydrate from a bacterium to a carrier protein, which helps to stimulate an immune response. Examples of conjugate vaccines include the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine.\n\nThe specific method used to make a vaccine depends on various factors, including the type of virus or bacteria, the target population, and the desired immune response."}

For instance, American football includes the use of protective gear, has a more structured and stop-and-go gameplay, and allows for forward passing of the ball, which are not present in rugby."}

They have a large head relative to their body size, a stout neck, and a rounded rump with no tail, giving them a similar appearance to pigs. This physical similarity is the basis for the common name of the guinea pig. The scientific name of the common species, Cavia porcellus, also reflects this, with porcellus being Latin for \"little pig.\"\n\nReference(s):\nGuinea pig\nThe scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus, with porcellus being Latin for 'little pig'. Cavia is New Latin; it is derived from cabiai, the animal's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana. Cabiai may be an adaptation of the Portuguese \u00e7avia (now savia), which is itself derived from the Tupi word sauj\u00e1, meaning rat. Guinea pigs are called quwi or jaca in Quechua and cuy or cuyo (plural cuyes, cuyos) in the Spanish of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Ironically, breeders tend to use the more formal 'cavy' to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts, it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial 'guinea pig'.\n\nGuinea pig\nBecause the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, it more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat. Its normal body temperature is 101 -- 104 \u00b0 F (38 -- 40 \u00b0 C), so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human's, about 65 -- 75 \u00b0 F (18 -- 24 \u00b0 C). Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90 \u00b0 F (32 \u00b0 C) have been linked to hyperthermia and death, especially among pregnant sows.

The state provided more troops to the Confederacy than any other state did. However, not all North Carolinians supported the Confederacy. Some yeoman farmers in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral or covertly supported the Union cause. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North. Numerous slaves also escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free. Union forces occupied parts of coastal North Carolina and initially were welcomed by local unionists. However, the occupiers later were perceived as oppressive and callous, leading some ex-Unionists to support the Confederate cause. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865. In April 1865, after losing the Battle of Morrisville, Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place, in what is today Durham. North Carolina's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865, after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher, its major defense downriver."}

According to the document, a typical wedding in the United States involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure or a municipal official. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will 'give away' the bride to the groom. The protocol for toasting at weddings is also described, with the father of the bride, the best man, the maid of honor, and the groom typically offering toasts. However, the document does not cover the wedding traditions of other cultures or religions, such as Jewish weddings, which are also mentioned in the provided documents.\n\nIn many Orthodox Jewish communities, the bride is escorted to the chuppah by her father and mother.

The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has responded to green card denials by asking the USCIS to document the marital status of same-sex couples and determine whether the foreign national would qualify for a green card in the absence of DOMA Section 3. This suggests that bi-national same-sex couples may now have a path towards legal immigration.\n\nFor bi-national opposite-sex unmarried partners, they were treated the same as bi-national same-sex spouses under the classification \"cohabiting partners\" when obtaining a visitor's visa.\n\nIt's important to note that the immigration process can be complex and the specifics may vary depending on the couple's situation. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with an immigration lawyer or expert for advice tailored to a specific case."}

During the Revolution, it was a key river due to its connection to the Mohawk River, allowing travelers to reach the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Its proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain also allowed the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City, which was part of the British strategy to cut off the patriot hub of New England and focus on rallying support from loyalists in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions.\n\nIn addition, during the 19th century, the Hudson River became a major location for production during the Industrial Revolution. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast, leading to the construction of hundreds of factories around the Hudson in towns such as Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The North Tarrytown Assembly, on the river in Sleepy Hollow, was a large and notable example. The river's link to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes further facilitated manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, for transport.\n\nFurthermore, the combination of canals built in the 1800s, such as the Erie Canal, Champlain Canal, Oswego Canal, Cayuga-Seneca Canal, and Delaware and Hudson Canal, made the Hudson River one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation."}

Cummings, whose full name was Edward Estlin Cummings, was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He was born on October 14, 1894, and passed away on September 3, 1962. Cummings is often recognized for his distinct style, which frequently features unconventional grammar, punctuation, and word order. It is worth noting that some of his most well-known poems do not rely heavily on typography or punctuation, but they still carry his signature style.\n\nCummings was a prolific writer, producing approximately 2900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. His first published work following his autobiographical novel, The Enormous Room, was a collection of poems titled Tulips and Chimneys, which was published in 1923. This work marked the public's first encounter with his signature use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Cummings, his papers are held at the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Additionally, in 1952 and 1953, Cummings delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, which were later published as i: six nonlectures."}

Cummings's life was significantly affected by the death of his father, which had a profound impact on his artistic work. He entered a new period in his artistic life, focusing on more important aspects of life in his poetry. His famous poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\" is a tribute to his father, marking the beginning of this new period.\n\nCummings was influenced by notable modernists, including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, and drew upon the imagist experiments of Amy Lowell. His visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and surrealism, which he later reflected in his work. As he matured as a poet, he began to rely more on symbolism and allegory, using less comparisons and relying more on symbols, which made his later poetry \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\" Cummings also had a fondness for incorporating imagery of nature and death into his poetry.\n\nWhile there are no specific details in the provided document about any particular event that directly influenced his famous poems, the overall trajectory of Cummings's artistic development was significantly impacted by his experiences, the artists he was exposed to, and his personal reflections on life, love, and the human condition."}

Firstly, both aircraft are in motion, requiring the photographer to carefully plan and time their shots while accounting for the movement of both aircraft. Secondly, the photographer has less control over the positioning and angle of the subject aircraft, as they are dependent on the pilot of the second aircraft. Lastly, air-to-air photography often involves additional considerations such as lighting, weather conditions, and safety concerns, which can increase the level of difficulty compared to ground-to-air photography.
