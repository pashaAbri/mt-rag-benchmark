This means that objects can't be modified until the end of their retention period and the removal of any legal holds. This method is particularly useful for industries that require long-term data retention, such as Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives.

Users need to manage retention periods manually.\n\nApart from cloud storage, there are other methods of storage like local storage, network-attached storage (NAS), and storage area networks (SAN). The choice of storage method depends on various factors like data size, required access speed, cost, data security, and disaster recovery needs.

query language built on Apache Lucene that allows you to perform complex searches and aggregations on your IBM Cloudant data. It supports a wide range of query types, including full-text search, numeric range queries, and faceted navigation.\n\nTo use IBM Cloudant Query, you first need to create a design document that defines the indexes you want to use for your query. A design document is a JSON document that contains one or more index definitions, as well as any query functions or views that you want to use.\n\nOnce you have created a design document, you can use the _search endpoint to execute queries against the indexes defined in your design document. The _search endpoint supports several parameters, including the index name, the query string, and the include_docs parameter, which allows you to include the full document in the query results.\n\nHere's an example of a query that uses IBM Cloudant Query to search for documents with a specific author and year:\n\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX\\_NAME?include\\_docs=true&query=\"author:\\\"Dickens\\\" AND year:1840\" HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\n\nIn this example, the query string \"author:\\\"Dickens\\\" AND year:1840\" searches for documents where the author field is equal to \"Dickens\" and the year field is equal to 1840. The include\\_docs parameter is set to true, so the full document is included in the query results.\n\nYou can also use the IBM Cloudant Query API to execute queries programmatically from your application. The API supports several programming languages, including Java, Node, Python, and Go.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}

To set up a namespace, you can follow the steps in the document titled \"[Set up a namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-startedgs_registry_namespace_add)\".\n\nIn summary, you can use the `ibmcloud cr namespace-add` command followed by the name of the new namespace to create a namespace. The name of the namespace must meet certain requirements, such as being unique across all IBM Cloud accounts in the same region, having 4-30 characters, starting and ending with a letter or number, and containing only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.\n\nOnce you have created a namespace, you can configure access to resources within that namespace at the resource group level by assigning the namespace to a resource group. You can use the `ibmcloud cr namespace-assign` command followed by the name of the namespace and the name or ID of the resource group to assign a namespace to a resource group.\n\nIt is important to note that if you have the Manager role at the account level, you can add or remove namespaces. However, if you don't have the Manager role, you may need to request access from an administrator.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a namespace is already set up for your account, you can run the `ibmcloud cr namespace-list` command with the `-v` option to retrieve existing namespace information.\n\nI hope this helps!

However, you can specify a different baseURL to connect to a different Cloud Functions installation. For example, you can use the following code to set the baseURL to a local installation running at <http://localhost:8080>:\n\n```swift\nwhisk.baseURL = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n```\n\nThis way, you can use the mobile SDK to interact with different Cloud Functions installations as needed."}

configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. You can specify the SIP endpoint for your support agent service or a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues in the SIP target when a call fails field. Additionally, you can configure a message for the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent, as well as a message for when transfer to a live agent fails. If you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step.\n\nHowever, if you want to use third-party providers for disaster recovery, you may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only switch the call to the backup region when all the zones in a single region fail. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\nIf you need to handle partial service outages, Watson Assistant can respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. This can be used to redirect the call to another zone or another region. You can request this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance from IBM.\n\nIt's also recommended to plan for both full and partial service outages, starting with a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment."}

Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. It's a usage-based pricing model, where you pay for what you consume.\n\n3. Tiered: Tiered pricing is based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans, with the price decreasing as the usage increases. This pricing model is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls.\n\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price.

Keep in mind that deleting messages might affect the Overview metrics, such as the Total Conversations count.\n\nTo delete the entire conversation history, you can use the IBM Cloud Functions or the Watson Assistant API to delete the messages. However, this will permanently remove all messages, and you won't be able to retrieve them afterward.

Use the `ibmcloud cis firewall-update` command with the appropriate parameters to create your firewall rule.\n\nFor example, to create a lockdown rule for a specific domain, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nibmcloud cis firewall-update e6106d7ec58e47ebb2fa053dedcd7dcb -t lockdowns -d 31984fea73a15b45779fa0df4ef62f9b --json '{\"urls\": [\"api.mysite.com/some/endpoint\"], \"configurations\": [{\"target\": \"ip\", \"value\": \"127.0.0.1\"}, {\"target\": \"ip_range\", \"value\": \"2.2.2.0/24\"}]}' -i \"cis-demo\"\n```\n\nThis command will lock down access to the specified URLs to only the IP address and IP range you specified.\n\n4. Test your firewall rule to ensure that it is working as intended.\n\nRemember that firewall rules can be based on IP address, IP address range, Autonomous System Number (ASN), or country/region. Also, keep in mind that domain lockdown rules specify a list of IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or networks that can access a domain, subdomain, or URL, and anything not on the list is blocked."}
