In soccer, the ball is mostly moved around by being kicked, and only two players on the field, the goalkeepers, can use their hands. The aim is to kick or head the ball into the opposing team's goal. On the other hand, American football is played with an oval-shaped ball, and players can use their hands to run, pass, or catch the ball. The offense, which has possession of the ball, tries to advance down the field and score by either running the ball into the end zone for a touchdown or kicking it through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The defense aims to stop the offense's advance and take control of the ball for themselves.\n\nAnother notable difference is the field dimensions. In soccer, the field is typically larger and has no specific dimensions, while American football is played on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. Soccer games consist of two 45-minute halves with additional stoppage time, while American football games are divided into four 15-minute quarters with breaks in between.\n\nLastly, the scoring systems are different. In soccer, a goal is worth one point, and the team with the most goals at the end of the game wins. In American football, touchdowns are worth six points, field goals are worth three points, and safeties (bringing the ball down in the opposing team's end zone) are worth two points. Teams can also score extra points after touchdowns, with one or two additional points available depending on the play."}

served as the Chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974. He was a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and is known for his policy of Ostpolitik, which aimed to improve relations with East Germany and other Eastern Bloc countries. This policy included negotiating nonaggression treaties with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Brandt was a strong advocate for human rights and rapprochement, and his policies contributed to the eventual reunification of Germany. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his contributions to world peace.\n\nIn addition to his role as Chancellor, Brandt also served as the Governing Mayor of Berlin from 1957 to 1966 and as the Chairman of the SPD from 1964 to 1987. He played a significant role in German politics and was a prominent figure in the international community during the Cold War era.\n\nThe document also mentions that Brandt was forced to resign in 1974 after it was discovered that G\u00fcnter Guillaume, a senior member of his staff, was a spy for the East German intelligence service, the Stasi. Despite this setback, Brandt's legacy as a champion of human rights and rapprochement continues to be celebrated in Germany and around the world."}

He was selected in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002 and voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years in 2004. In 2011, when UEFA polled players, journalists, and their users to crown the best player in the UEFA Champions League of the past 20 years, Zidane topped the vote.

"Vaccines can be made using different methods depending on the type of vaccine. Here are the three main types of vaccines and how they are typically made:\n\n1. Live-attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus or bacteria that cause the disease. They are typically made by growing the virus or bacteria in culture, then reducing its virulence (or ability to cause disease) through various methods, such as exposure to chemicals or radiation. Examples of live-attenuated vaccines include the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.\n2. Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain viruses or bacteria that have been killed or inactivated so that they can no longer cause disease. They are typically made by growing the virus or bacteria in culture, then killing or inactivating it using chemicals, heat, or radiation. Examples of inactivated vaccines include the polio vaccine and the hepatitis A vaccine.\n3. Subunit vaccines: These vaccines contain only the specific components of the virus or bacteria that are responsible for triggering an immune response. They are typically made using biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques, which allow scientists to isolate and produce specific viral or bacterial proteins. Examples of subunit vaccines include the hepatitis B vaccine and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific methods used to produce vaccines can vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific vaccine. The documents provided do not contain detailed information on how vaccines are made."}

However, Roosevelt played a role in the U.S. response to several international conflicts, such as the Japanese Invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Italian Conquest of Ethiopia, the Spanish Civil War, and the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n* Roosevelt's Quarantine Speech in 1937 expressed concern about the spread of aggression by totalitarian states, which reflected his administration's growing interventionist stance.\n* Roosevelt's administration used loopholes to provide support to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, such as allowing volunteers to fight and using British ships to deliver provisions.\n* Roosevelt served as the Vice President under President William McKinley and became the youngest President at the age of 42 after McKinley's assassination in 1900.\n* Roosevelt's New Deal policies during the Great Depression expanded the role of the federal government and redefined liberalism for coming generations.\n* Roosevelt played a central role in shaping and financing World War II, with his isolationist critics fading away and even the Republicans joining in his overall policies.\n* Roosevelt's presidency increased the power of the president at the expense of Congress, and his widow, Eleanor Roosevelt, continued to be a forceful presence in U.S. and world politics after his death.\n* Many members of Roosevelt's administration played leading roles in the administrations of Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson, embracing his political legacy.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions or need more information related to Roosevelt's involvement in these or other historical events."}

Testicular malformations: These can also contribute to male infertility.\n3. Hormone imbalance: An imbalance in hormones can affect a man's ability to father a child.\n4. Blockage of the duct system: If the man's duct system is blocked, it could prevent the sperm from reaching the egg.\n5. Primary ciliary dyskinesia: This condition can cause infertility by affecting the sperm's ability to provide the zygote with necessary DNA, centrioles, and activation factor.\n6.

Confederate states during the US Civil War, with approximately 125,000 North Carolinians serving in the military. The state saw the most deaths of any Confederate state, with 20,000 killed in battle and 21,000 dying of disease. Although the state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in Richmond, only small battles took place within its borders.\n\nDespite North Carolina's support for the Confederacy, some of its citizens refused to back the Confederate cause. In the state's mountains and western Piedmont region, some yeoman farmers remained neutral, while others covertly supported the Union. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army. In addition, two Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state, which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Numerous slaves also escaped to Union lines, becoming essentially free.\n\nThe first Confederate soldier killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina. The 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment. The 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield during the Battle of Chickamauga. At Appomattox Court House in Virginia, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War.\n\nConfederate troops from North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865. In April 1865, after losing the Battle of Morrisville, Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place, in what is today Durham. North Carolina's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate"}

The industry is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2020.\n\nMost of the retail industry in India consists of local mom-and-pop stores, owner-manned shops, and street vendors. However, retail supermarkets are expanding, with a market share of 4% in 2008. The Indian government permitted 51% FDI in multi-brand retail and 100% FDI in single-brand retail in 2012, but a lack of back-end warehouse infrastructure and state-level permits and red tape continue to limit the growth of organized retail.\n\nCompliance with over thirty regulations, such as \"signboard licenses\" and \"anti-hoarding measures,\" must be made before a store can open for business. There are also taxes for moving goods from state to state and even within states, which contribute to a third of India's agriculture produce being lost from spoilage due to a lack of infrastructure and efficient retail networks.\n\nChennai, an IT hub, is an important gold market in India and contributes to 45% of the 800-tonne annual national gold uptake. The city is also the base to the World Gold Council's India operations, with the city's retail industry majorly concentrated in T. Nagar, which accounts for a major share of jewellery and clothes sold in Chennai.\n\nThe textile industry in India is also closely linked to the retail industry. It is the second largest employment generating sector in India, providing direct employment to over 35 million people. According to AT Kearney's 'Retail Apparel Index', India was ranked as the fourth most promising market for apparel retailers in 2009."}

inherited disorder. It is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the Huntingtin gene, which means that a child of an affected person has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.

that interprets, analyzes, or comments on primary sources. These sources are created after the fact and often provide an explanation or context for the events or ideas presented in primary sources. Examples of secondary sources include scholarly articles, books, and documentaries that discuss and interpret historical events or literary works. Secondary sources can be useful for understanding complex ideas or events, as they offer an informed perspective on primary sources and can help to clarify their meaning and significance. However, it is important to remember that secondary sources are one step removed from the original source material and their interpretations may be influenced by the author's perspective, biases, or assumptions.\n\nIn literary studies, secondary sources might include critical essays, book reviews, or scholarly articles that analyze and interpret a particular literary work or author's oeuvre. These sources can provide valuable insights into the themes, styles, and historical contexts of literary works, and can help scholars to better understand the significance and impact of literature on society and culture.\n\nIn the context of historical research, secondary sources might include scholarly books, articles, or documentaries that analyze and interpret primary sources related to a particular historical event or period. These sources can provide valuable context and background information, and can help historians to better understand the significance and impact of historical events and figures.\n\nIt is important to note that the distinction between primary and secondary sources can be contextual and subjective. For example, a historical document might be considered a primary source for one research project and a secondary source for another, depending on the specific research question and context. Similarly, a scholarly article that analyzes a literary work might be considered a secondary source for a literary analysis project, but could be considered a primary source for a research project on the history of literary criticism."}

During the Revolution, the Hudson River played a key role due to its connection to the Mohawk River, allowing travelers to reach the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Its proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain also allowed the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City, which was part of a strategy to cut off the patriot hub of New England and focus on rallying support from loyalists in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Hudson River became a major location for production during the Industrial Revolution. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast, leading to the establishment of hundreds of factories around the Hudson in towns such as Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The river's link to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes enabled manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, to use the river for transport.\n\nAdditionally, the Hudson River was made even more vital for trade with the completion of various canals, such as the Erie Canal, Champlain Canal, Oswego Canal, Cayuga-Seneca Canal, and Delaware and Hudson Canal. These canals connected the Hudson River with other significant waterways, making the Hudson one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation.\n\nIn terms of geography, the lower Hudson is a tidal estuary, with tidal influence extending as far as the Federal Dam in Troy. Strong tides and ice floes during the winter can make parts of New York Harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate."}

Cummings is estimated to have written around 2900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.\n\nFrom a young age, Cummings was interested in poetry and started writing daily when he was 8 years old, experimenting with various forms. He attended Harvard University, where he developed a fondness for modern poetry that disregarded traditional grammar and syntax, favoring a more dynamic use of language.

His early work reflected this influence, but during his visits to Paris, he was exposed to Dada and surrealism, which he later incorporated into his poetry. His style evolved to rely more on symbolism and allegory, using symbols instead of explicit comparisons in his later work. This shift resulted in poetry that was often more lucid, moving, and profound.\n\nCummings also had a strong affinity for incorporating imagery of nature and death into his poetry.

Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .)\n- United States (Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 , after 1820 , cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South , and along with it , the slave population .)"}

"Both air-to-air and ground-to-air photography have their own challenges, and the difficulty may depend on various factors such as the photographer's experience, equipment, and specific conditions. However, air-to-air photography is generally considered more challenging due to the additional complexities of managing two aircraft in flight, maintaining a stable platform for shooting, and coordinating the positioning of the subject aircraft for optimal lighting and composition. Ground-to-air photography, on the other hand, usually involves a stationary photographer on the ground, but requires a long focus lens to capture the aircraft from a distance."}

Remote photography is a variation of aerial air-to-air photography, where the camera is mounted onto the external aircraft structure and triggered remotely, with the image composition planned on the ground."}
