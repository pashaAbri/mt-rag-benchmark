In soccer, the field is typically larger and more rectangular, and goals are scored by kicking the ball into the opponent's net.

German politician who served as the Chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974. He was a key figure in the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and initiated the policy of Ostpolitik, aimed at improving relations with the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany. This policy resulted in the signing of several significant agreements, such as the Moscow Agreement, the Warsaw Agreement, the Four-Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin, and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany. Brandt's efforts in normalizing relations with Eastern European countries contributed to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over East-Central Europe in the long term.\n\nBrandt was also known for his historic gesture of humility and penance, the Warschauer Kniefall, in which he knelt before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during a visit to Warsaw in 1970. Unfortunately, his political career was cut short when his personal assistant, G\u00fcnter Guillaume, was discovered to be an East German spy, forcing Brandt to resign in 1974. Brandt's contributions to world peace were acknowledged with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971."}

They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual, and can also be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses reside in the nerve cell bodies for the person's lifetime. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. People with herpes can transmit the virus even when they do not have any visible symptoms, through a phenomenon known as asymptomatic shedding. This can represent the most common form of HSV-2 transmission. Asymptomatic carriers of the HSV-2 virus are still contagious and, since most asymptomatic individuals are unaware of their infection, they are considered at high risk for spreading HSV."}

This is usually done by taking a sample from an infected person or animal and growing the pathogen in a lab.\n\n2. Pathogen weakening or killing: For live attenuated vaccines, the pathogen is weakened so that it cannot cause the disease but can still stimulate an immune response. This is done by growing the pathogen under conditions that cause it to mutate, or by using genetic engineering techniques to modify the pathogen's genes. For inactivated vaccines, the pathogen is killed using chemicals, heat, or radiation.\n\n3. Purification: The weakened or killed pathogen is then purified to remove any unnecessary components, such as cell debris or toxins.\n\n4. Combination with adjuvants: Adjuvants are substances that enhance the body's immune response to the vaccine. They are often added to the vaccine to improve its effectiveness.\n\n5. Quality control: The final vaccine is tested to ensure it meets quality and safety standards. This includes testing for sterility, potency, and purity.\n\n6. Packaging and distribution: Once the vaccine has passed quality control, it is packaged and distributed to healthcare providers for administration to patients."}

Players earn roster spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner.

Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy, a serious and painful disease causing symptoms such as gum deterioration, bleeding, skin discoloration, and poor wound healing.\n3. Guinea pigs, like humans, cannot synthesize their own Vitamin C and require about 10 mg (20 mg if pregnant) daily from food sources like fresh fruits and vegetables or through dietary supplements.\n\nIf you have specific Vitamin C research questions or need more information on any of these points, please let me know!"}

also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, fell for a variety of reasons. One significant factor was the gradual weakening of its military and economy. The Empire had transitioned from a rapid response, primarily defensive, citizen army to a professional, campaigning army, increasingly manned by mercenaries. However, mercenaries were expensive, and as the threat of invasion receded, the need for maintaining large garrisons and expensive fortifications decreased.\n\nAdditionally, Basil II, who left a burgeoning treasury upon his death, neglected to plan for his succession. His immediate successors lacked military or political talent, and the administration of the Empire fell into the hands of the civil service. Efforts to revive the Byzantine economy resulted in inflation and a debased gold coinage. The army was seen as an unnecessary expense and a political threat, leading to the cashiering of native troops and their replacement with foreign mercenaries on specific contract.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire also faced external threats, such as the Arab conquests, which resulted in the loss of Syria, Egypt, and the Levant. The Empire was able to defend Constantinople from the Arabs in the 7th century, but the frequent raiding parties and sieges took their toll, contributing to the decline of classical urban culture and the eventual fall of the Empire.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire finally fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, marking the end of the Roman Empire in the East. At this time, Egypt had been under Muslim control for some seven centuries, but Orthodoxy was strong in Russia, which had recently acquired an autocephalous status. Moscow called itself the Third Rome, as the cultural heir of Constantinople."}

Byzantine Empire did control parts of Israel during certain periods. For example, it recaptured Antioch in 969, which it incorporated as a province of the Empire. Later, it recaptured Damascus, Beirut, Acre, Sidon, Caesarea, and Tiberias, putting Byzantine armies within striking distance of Jerusalem. However, the Muslim power centers in Iraq and Egypt were left untouched.\n\nIt's important to note that the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, was not the same as the Roman Empire in the West, and its control of regions varied over time. Also, the Byzantine Empire should not be confused with the Crusaders or other conquerors who controlled parts of Israel during different periods."}

significant role in the American Revolutionary War. It was the first colony to instruct its delegates to vote for independence from the British Crown, which it did through the Halifax Resolves passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress on April 12, 1776. This event is memorialized on the state flag and seal. Throughout the war, fierce guerrilla warfare erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists, with some using the war as an opportunity to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at King's Mountain along the North Carolina-South Carolina border on October 7, 1780, when a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina and southwest Virginia overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson. This victory gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence and prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.

The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in Richmond, and the state was the scene of only small battles. However, Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville, and the state's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union in February 1865. Some North Carolinians, particularly in the western mountains and Piedmont region, refused to support the Confederacy and covertly supported the Union cause. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North. Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free. Union forces occupied parts of coastal North Carolina and were initially welcomed by local unionists, but they were later perceived as oppressive and callous, leading to ex-Unionists supporting the Confederate cause."}

It is the primary site of new blood cell production, or hematopoiesis. Bone marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, including all types of hematopoietic cells such as white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). However, lymphoid cells must migrate to other lymphoid organs to complete maturation. In humans, red marrow is mainly found in the central skeleton, such as the pelvis, sternum, cranium, ribs, vertebrae, and scapulae, and in the proximal epiphyseal ends of long bones like the femur and humerus.

During the Revolution, it was a key river due to its connection to the Mohawk River, allowing travelers to reach the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Its proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain also allowed the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City, which was part of a strategy to cut off the patriot hub of New England and focus on rallying support in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Hudson River became a major location for production during the Industrial Revolution. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast, leading to the construction of hundreds of factories around the Hudson in towns including Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The North Tarrytown Assembly in Sleepy Hollow was a large and notable example.\n\nFurthermore, the Hudson River links to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes, allowing manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, to use the river for transport. The development of new technologies for transport, such as steamboats, also made the Hudson River an even more vital waterway for transport. The first commercially successful steamboat, the North River Steamboat (later known as Clermont), began operating along the Hudson River in 1807.\n\nIn addition, the Hudson River is also environmentally significant. It is home to many species of fish and other aquatic life, and its watershed provides drinking water for millions of people. The river also has cultural and historical significance, with many historic sites and scenic areas along its banks.\n\nIn summary, the Hudson River is important for its historical, economic, environmental, and cultural significance."}

From season three to season five, the stars were paid $75,000, $85,000, and $100,000 per episode, respectively. This increased to $125,000 in season six. In seasons seven and eight, they were paid $750,000 per episode, and in seasons nine and ten, they were paid $1 million per episode.

This shift contributed to his later poetry being \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\" He also had a fondness for incorporating imagery of nature and death into his work.\n\nConfidence: 90%"}

aviation photography. In addition to air-to-air and ground-to-air photography, there is also ground-static photography, where photos of stationary aircraft are taken by photographers on the ground, and remote photography, which is a variation of air-to-air photography that involves mounting the camera onto the external aircraft structure and triggering it remotely. Each type of aviation photography requires a unique set of skills and presents its own set of challenges. For example, ground-static photography allows the photographer to have full control over lighting, aircraft placement, camera angles, and background, while remote photography requires careful planning and brainstorming to compose the image before takeoff."}
