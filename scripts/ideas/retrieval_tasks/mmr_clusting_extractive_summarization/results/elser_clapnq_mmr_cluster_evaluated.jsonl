It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise , and the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) considers it to be one of the `` most important championships available to the sport '' . Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . After a series of league mergers and folds , it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 .","title":"Stanley Cup","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"798029343_451-1065-0-614","score":16.193016,"text":"America's Cup\nThe America 's Cup , affectionately known as the `` Auld Mug '' , is a trophy awarded to the winner of the America 's Cup match races between two sailing yachts .

It is unusual among trophies to include winning members ' names . Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted .

In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League .

Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards .

The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

This derives from the Middle High German name merswin . This originally meant `` dolphin '' and was used because of the animals ' grunting sounds ( which were thought to be similar ) . Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_5986-6941-0-955","score":28.396374,"text":"Guinea pig\nThe origin of `` guinea '' in `` guinea pig '' is harder to explain .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America . A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color .

They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 , which provided for comprehensive planning , technical services , research , and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure . The Act was amended in 1965 , establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so . Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s , in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns . In 1970 EPA was created by the Richard Nixon administration , and authority for managing various environmental programs was transferred to the new agency . In 1972 , Congress passed the Clean Water Act , requiring industrial plants and municipal sewage plants to proactively improve their waste treatment practices in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources . In 1974 , the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems . This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed . From then on , drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal , state , and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations . The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion in research and construction grants for municipal sewage treatment . The funds initially provided an incentive to build centralized wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure for municipalities , instead of decentralized systems . However , the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act required communities to consider alternatives to the conventional centralized sewer systems , and financial assistance was made available for such alternatives . In the mid-1990s decentralized systems served approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population , and approximately 37 percent of new housing developments .","title":"Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834226571_364-764-0-400","score":17.193205,"text":"Storm drain\nA storm drain , storm sewer ( U.S. and Canada ) , surface water drain \/ sewer ( United Kingdom ) , or stormwater drain ( Australia and New Zealand ) is designed to drain excess rain and ground water from impervious surfaces such as paved streets , car parks , parking lots , footpaths , sidewalks , and roofs .

The need for irrigation led the Sumerians , and later the Akkadians , to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers . Major cities , such as Ur and Uruk , took root on tributaries of the Euphrates , while others , notably Lagash , were built on branches of the Tigris . The rivers provided the further benefits of fish ( used both for food and fertilizer ) , reeds , and clay ( for building materials ) . With irrigation , the food supply in Mesopotamia was compabale to the Canadian prairies . The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the Fertile Crescent , which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile . Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops , portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable . This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia . Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts . Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley , onions , grapes , turnips , and apples . Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine . As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian , farmers did not depend on slaves to complete farm work for them , but there were some exceptions . There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical ( i.e. the escape \/ mutiny of the slave ) . Although the rivers sustained life , they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities . The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers ; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept .

He went to Uraga Channel with Morrison , an unarmed American merchant ship . The ship was attacked several times , and sailed back without completing its mission . In 1846 , Commander James Biddle , anchored in Edo Bay on an official mission with two ships , including one warship armed with 72 cannons , asking for ports to be opened for trade , but his requests for a trade agreement remained unsuccessful . In 1849 , Captain James Glynn sailed to Nagasaki , leading at last to the first successful negotiation by an American with Japan . James Glynn recommended to the United States Congress that negotiations to open Japan be backed up by a demonstration of force , thus paving the way for Perry 's expedition .","title":"Perry Expedition","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846612211_78583-79160-0-577","score":18.253801,"text":"Axis powers\nIn order to maintain its military campaign in China with the major loss of petroleum trade with the United States , Japan saw the best means to secure an alternative source of petroleum in the petroleum - rich and natural - resources - rich Southeast Asia .

The American historian Louise Young described Japan from September 1931 to the spring of 1933 as gripped by `` war fever '' as the conquest of Manchuria proved to be an extremely popular war . The metaphor of a `` lifeline '' suggested that Manchuria was crucial to the functioning of the Japanese economy , which explains why the conquest of Manchuria was so popular and why afterwards Japanese public opinion was so hostile towards any suggestion of letting Manchuria go . At the time , censorship in Japan was nowhere near as stringent as it later became , and Young noted : `` Had they wished , it would have been possible in 1931 and 1932 for journalists and editors to express anti-war sentiments '' . The liberal journal Kaiz\u014d criticized the war with the journalist Got\u014d Shinobu in the November 1931 edition accusing the Kwangtung Army of a `` two-fold coup d'\u00e9tat '' against both the government in Tokyo and against the government of China . Voices like Kaiz\u014d were a minority as mainstream newspapers like the Asahi soon discovered that an anti-war editorial position hurt sales , and so switched over to an aggressively militaristic editorial position as the best way to increase sales . Japan 's most famous pacifist , the poet Akiko Yosano had caused a sensation in 1904 with her anti-war poem `` Brother Do Not Give Your Life '' , addressed to her younger brother serving in the Imperial Army that called the war with Russia stupid and senseless . Such was the extent of `` war fever '' in Japan in 1931 that even Akiko succumbed , writing a poem in 1932 praising bushid\u014d , urging the Kwantung Army to `` smash the sissified dreams of compromise '' and declared that to die for the Emperor in battle was the most `` purest '' act a Japanese man could perform .","title":"Japanese invasion of Manchuria","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836878553_33585-33903-0-318","score":15.95506,"text":"Causes of World War II\nIn 1931 Japan took advantage of China 's weakness in the Warlord Era and fabricated the Mukden Incident in 1931 to set up the puppet state of Manchukuo in Manchuria , with Puyi , who had been the last emperor of China , as its emperor .

Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_2155-2640-0-485","score":20.655933,"text":"Guinea pig\nBiological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836413300_32203-33897-0-1694","score":15.707913,"text":"Infertility\nHigh costs may also be a factor and research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology , in Belgium , claimed a much lower cost methodology ( about 90 % reduction ) with similar efficacy , which may be suitable for some fertility treatment .

Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible . Additionally , counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment , and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well . While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations ( such as sub-Saharan African countries ) , a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention .

Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions .

The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 -- 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( \u6210 \u5468 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 -- 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy .

Once the Xiongnu were chased away , Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_23977-25578-0-1601","score":10.230748,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nAs the Han -- Xiongnu War progressed in favour of the Han , the Wall became maintained and extended beyond Qin lines .

In this way , Wei Qing reconquered the irrigable lands north of the Ordos and restored the spur of defences protecting that territory from the steppe . In addition to rebuilding the walls , archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu 's reign . The fortifications here include embankments , beacon stations , and forts , all constructed with a combination of tamped - earth cores and stone frontages . From the Ordos Loop , the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei , Zhangye , and Jiuquan , leading into the Juyan Lake Basin , and terminating in two places : the Yumen Pass in the north , or the Yang Pass to the south , both in the vicinity of Dunhuang . Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications -- further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass , about 460 kilometres ( 290 mi ) to the east . The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian .

In the following year , 214 BC , Qin Shi Huang ordered new fortifications to be built along the Yellow River to the west of the Ordos while work continued in the north . This work was completed probably by 212 BC , signalled by Qin Shi Huang 's imperial tour of inspection and the construction of the Direct Road ( \u76f4\u9053 ) connecting the capital Xianyang with the Ordos .

Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China . However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate . The average size of land holdings is very small , with 70 % of holdings being less than one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) in size . Irrigation facilities are inadequate , as revealed by the fact that only 46 % of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016 , resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall , specifically the monsoon season , which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit . These inputs were easily available in at least parts of the states of Punjab , Haryana , and western Uttar Pradesh ; thus , yields increased most in these states .","title":"Green Revolution in India","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.296081911,"ndcg_cut_5":0.4981892575,"ndcg_cut_10":0.4981892575}}

The Indianapolis Colts franchise traces its history through several predecessors , including one of the league 's founding teams -- the Dayton Triangles -- but is considered a separate franchise from those teams and was founded as the Baltimore Colts in 1953 .

The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end - of - season World Championship Game between the two league champions ( later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game ) .

He appeared in both the main story detailing the formation of superhero `` non-team '' the Defenders , and the related back - up story . The character then starred in a revival solo series in Marvel Premiere # 3 - 14 ( July 1972 -- March 1974 ) . This arc marked the debut of another recurring foe , the entity Shuma - Gorath , created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Frank Brunner , who took over as the regular creative team starting with Marvel Premiere # 10 . Englehart and Brunner collaborated closely on the stories , meeting over dinner every two months to discuss the series , and their run became known for its psychedelic visuals and plots . In issues # 8 - 10 ( May -- September 1973 ) , Strange is forced to shut down the Ancient One 's mind , causing his mentor 's physical death . Strange then assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme . Englehart and Brunner created another multi-issue storyline featuring sorcerer Sise - Neg ( `` Genesis '' spelled backward ) going back through history , collecting all magical energies , until he reaches the beginning of the universe , becomes all - powerful and creates it anew , leaving Strange to wonder whether this was , paradoxically , the original creation . Stan Lee , seeing the issue after publication , ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but a god , to avoid offending religious readers . The writer and artist concocted a fake letter from a fictitious minister praising the story , and mailed it to Marvel from Texas .

Romeo and Juliet is not considered to be exceedingly psychologically complex , and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses . Norman Holland , writing in 1966 , considers Romeo 's dream as a realistic `` wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of Romeo 's adult world and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral , phallic and oedipal '' -- while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of the author . Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other . That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers ' language : Juliet , for example , speaks of `` my only love sprung from my only hate '' and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo 's death .

But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing `` fullest peace '' for having done `` their duty '' . Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British had employed ruthless means of suppression , the Quit India movement was `` by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857 '' , as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill .

Though feeling that the British would not leave immediately , Patel favoured an all - out rebellion that would galvanise the Indian people , who had been divided in their response to the war , In Patel 's view , such a rebellion would force the British to concede that continuation of colonial rule had no support in India , and thus speed the transfer of power to Indians . Believing strongly in the need for revolt , Patel stated his intention to resign from the Congress if the revolt were not approved . Gandhi strongly pressured the All India Congress Committee to approve an all - out campaign of civil disobedience , and the AICC approved the campaign on 7 August 1942 . Though Patel 's health had suffered during his stint in jail , he gave emotional speeches to large crowds across India , asking them to refuse to pay taxes and to participate in civil disobedience , mass protests , and a shutdown of all civil services .

Ships were the fastest vehicles at the time , as trains and automobiles were still being developed . In order to facilitate shipping throughout the country 's interior , numerous canals were constructed between internal bodies of water in the 1800s . One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal , built to link the Midwest to the Port of New York , a significant seaport during that time . The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West , allowing settlers to travel west , send goods to markets in frontier cities , and export goods via the Hudson River and New York City . The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation , surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts . After the completion of the Erie Canal , smaller canals were built to connect it with the new system . The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain . This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway , and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City . Another major canal was the Oswego Canal , which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario , and could be used to bypass Niagara Falls . The Cayuga - Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake . Farther south , the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale , Pennsylvania , and the Hudson River at Kingston , New York . This canal enabled the transportation of coal , and later other goods as well , between the Delaware and Hudson River watersheds .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season .

Another theory sees the rhyme as connected to Mary , Queen of Scots ( 1542 -- 1587 ) , with `` how does your garden grow '' referring to her reign over her realm , `` silver bells '' referring to ( Catholic ) cathedral bells , `` cockle shells '' insinuating that her husband was not faithful to her , and `` pretty maids all in a row '' referring to her ladies - in - waiting -- `` The four Maries '' .

In 1861 , Missouri had sought to extradite an escaped slave from Canada to face trial for a murder committed in his flight for which some in Britain falsely believed the punishment was to be burned alive .","title":"United Kingdom and the American Civil War","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"849311646_7417-8054-0-637","score":17.30137,"text":"The Gambia\nTraders initially sent people to Europe to work as servants until the market for labour expanded in the West Indies and North America in the 18th century .

Furthermore , enslaved Africans were responsible for growing their own food .

Alternative sources of labour , such as indentured servitude , failed to provide a sufficient workforce . Many crops could not be sold for profit , or even grown , in Europe .

These units were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914 , but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915 . Aerial photography was attempted during 1914 , but again , it only became effective the following year . In August 1915 , General Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson . The British use of air power evolved during the war , from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of the air above the trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind the line . The early aircraft of the RFC were inferior to their German rivals ; in April 1917 , ( known as Bloody April ) , the RFC lost over 300 aircrew and 245 aircraft . Not until late 1917 , with the introduction of the Sopwith Camel and the S.E. 5 , were they able to compete successfully for control of the air .","title":"British Army during World War I","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"825986711_5007-5237-0-230","score":15.157048,"text":"Aviation photography\nThe Nikkormat camera with autowind pointed back at the Red Arrows team and was fitted with a wide angle 24mm Nikkor lens .
