Although Chancellor for only just over four years , Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period . Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after G\u00fcnter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi . Brandt 's contributions to world peace led to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 1971 .

Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats .

The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football , it is much slower - paced than the more hectic rugby league , in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play . Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league ; defending players interfering with any other attacking player ( and vice versa ) will incur a penalty . Passing in the two sports also differs : while backward passing is common to both sports , in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal . Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield . To score a try or touchdown in rugby league , the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone , whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line . American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment , including helmets , gloves and padding around the body , whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league , usually amounting to light padding ( if any ) and soft head gear ( hard helmets being illegal ) .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

Infertile couples may resort to egg donation when the female partner can not have genetic children because her own eggs can not generate a viable pregnancy , or because they could generate a viable pregnancy but the chances are so low that it is not advisable or not financially feasible to do IVF with her own eggs . This situation is often , but not always based on advanced reproductive age . It can also be due to early onset of menopause , which can occur as early as their 20s . In addition , some women are born without ovaries , while some women 's reproductive organs have been damaged or surgically removed due to disease or other circumstances . Another indication would be a genetic disorder on part of the woman that either renders her infertile or would be dangerous for any offspring , problems that can be circumvented by using eggs from another woman . Many women have none of these issues , but continue to be unsuccessful using their own eggs -- in other words , they have undiagnosed infertility -- and thus turn to donor eggs or donor embryos .

Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"797657139_76-428-0-352","score":0.6545012593,"text":"Endocrine system\nThis article 's lead section may be too long for the length of the article .

There is no significant difference in the number of surviving children in cousin marriages because this compensates for the observed increase in child mortality . The total fertility increase may be partly explained by the lower average parental age at marriage , and age at first birth , observed in consanguineous marriages . Other factors include shorter birth intervals and possibly a lower likelihood of using reliable contraception . There is also the possibility of more births as a compensation for increased child mortality , either via a conscious decision by parents to achieve a set family size or the cessation of lactational amenorrhea following the death of an infant . According to a recent paper the fertility difference is probably not due to any underlying biological effect . In Iceland , where marriages between second and third cousins were common , in part due to limited selection , studies show higher fertility rates . Earlier papers claimed that increased sharing of human leukocyte antigens , as well as of deleterious recessive genes expressed during pregnancy , may lead to lower rates of conception and higher rates of miscarriage in consanguineous couples . Others now believe there is scant evidence for this unless the genes are operating very early in the pregnancy .

Thus , a large majority of couples appear to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy , whether it is a boy or a girl . If the first child is a girl , and they are able to have a second child , then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy . If a couple already has two or more boys , the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction . This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring , a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play . Zeng 1993 reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys . A study by Anderson & Silver ( 1995 ) found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province : a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys . This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister , who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males , it was also much more likely to engage in `` stopping behavior '' , i.e. , to stop having more children .","title":"One-child policy","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_191-787-0-560","score":0.7568776011,"text":"Great Wall of China\nGreat Wall of China \u842c\u91cc \u9577\u57ce The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling Map of all the wall constructions General information Type Fortification Country China Coordinates 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Coordinates : 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Technical details Size 21,196 km ( 13,171 mi ) UNESCO World Heritage Site Official name The Great Wall Type Cultural Criteria i , ii , iii , iv , vi Designated 1987 ( 11th session ) Reference no . 438 State Party China Region Asia - Pacific","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_21373-22657-0-1284","score":0.7562121749,"text":"Great Wall of China\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated , in many other locations the Wall is in disrepair .

These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine - adenine - guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood .

As the disease advances , uncoordinated , jerky body movements become more apparent . Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk . Mental abilities generally decline into dementia . The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people . Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age , but can start at any age .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

The theme of a religious conflict between a Jewish merchant vs. a Christian merchant in The Merchant of Venice is generally ignored in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice as most Chinese find do not find the theme of Jewish - Christian conflict relevant. , Unlike in Western productions , the character of Shylock is very much an unnuanced villain in Chinese productions of The Merchant of Venice , being presented as a man capable only of envy , spite , greed and cruelty , a man whose actions are only motivated by his spiritual impoverishment . By contrast , in the West , Shylock is usually presented as a nuanced villain , of a man who has never held power over a Christian before , and lets that power go to his head . Another popular play , especially with dissidents under the Communist government , is Hamlet . Hamlet , with its theme of a man trapped under a tyrannical regime is very popular with Chinese dissidents with one dissident Wu Ningkun writing about his time in internal exile between 1958 - 61 at a collective farm in a remote part of northern Manchuria that he understood all too well the line from the play `` Denmark is a prison !

The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season .

In 1840 Fones McCarthy received a patent for a `` Smooth Cylinder Cotton - gin '' , a roller gin . McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day .

It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased . The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War . Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws , and offer far higher productivity than their hand - powered forebears .","title":"Cotton gin","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"805474955_10307-11336-0-1029","score":0.7117220163,"text":"Cotton gin\nThe invention of the cotton gin caused massive growth in the production of cotton in the United States , concentrated mostly in the South . Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market . The cotton gin thus `` transformed cotton as a crop and the American South into the globe 's first agricultural powerhouse '' .
