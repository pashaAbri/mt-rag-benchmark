IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1.

When you place an object in the bucket, a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the time of the object write.\n\nIf your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and Retain Until Date, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.\n\nLike all other Object Lock settings, the Retain Until Date applies to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.\n\nImagine an object that is 60 days into a 90-day retention period, and you overwrite that object with the same name and a two year retention period.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05166-7-1684", "score": 0.7329612970352173, "text": "\nRelease notes for Object Storage \n\nNews on the latest releases from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage provide the updates you need on all things related to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n 14 June 2023 \n\nNew location!\n: Buckets can now be created in a Regional (MZR) configuration in Madrid, Spain.

Here are some approaches you can use to address common goals.\n\n\n\n* Returning the user's input: You can capture the exact text uttered by the user and return it in your response. Use the following SpEL expression in a response to repeat the text that the user specified back in the response:\n\nYou said: <? input.text ?>.\n\nIf autocorrection is on, and you want to return the user's original input before it was corrected, you can use <? input.original_text ?>. But, be sure to use a response condition that checks whether the original_text field exists first.\n* Determining the number of words in user input: You can perform any of the supported String methods on the input.text object. For example, you can find out how many words there are in a user utterance by using the following SpEL expression:\n\ninput.text.split(' ').size()\n\nSee [Expression language methods for String](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-methodsdialog-methods-strings) to learn about more methods you can use.\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks. I want to open a savings account and apply for a credit card. How does the dialog recognize and address both of them?

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

For more information, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I continue to use the Speech to Text Standard plan? \n\nThe Standard plan is no longer available for purchase by new users. But existing users of the Standard plan can continue to use the plan indefinitely with no change in their pricing. Their API settings and custom models remain unaffected.\n\nExisting users can also choose to upgrade to the new Plus plan by visiting the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/speech-to-text). They will continue to have access to all of their settings and custom models after upgrading. And, if they find that the Plus plan does not meet their needs for any reason, they can always downgrade back to their Standard plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n What pricing plan do I need to use the service's customization interface? \n\nYou must have a paid plan (Plus, Standard, or Premium) to use language model or acoustic model customization.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about.

As noted, every example must include a label that indicates the \"goodness\" or \"badness\" of the document as it pertains to the query.\n\nExamples can optionally specify a cross-reference query.

Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search. For more information about adding synonyms that are recognized when documents are processed, see [Dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-domain-dictionary).\n\nYou can define two types of expansions:\n\nBidirectional\n: Each entry in the expanded_terms list expands to include all expanded terms.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

The driver uses the REST API of the service to run queries, stores the results in Cloud Object Storage, and makes these results accessible through JDBC interfaces.\n\nThe JDBC driver supports Java 17. To use of the JDBC driver in a Java 17 JVM, you must pass the following option to the JVM:\n\n--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED\n\nThe driver does not implement full JDBC-compliant functions, but only the parts of the API that are most commonly used by clients. The following functions are explicitly tested:\n\n\n\n* Retrieving query results with the following primitive SQL types: STRING or VARCHAR, INTEGER, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DECIMAL, DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP. TIMESTAMP columns are handled as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n* Inspecting result columns and types through the JDBC ResultSetMetaData interface.\n* Running DDL statements CREATE or DROP TABLE to manage objects in the [Data Engine catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-hivemetastore).\n* Accessing a list of tables and table columns through the JDBC DatabaseMetaData interface. The schema information is retrieved from the Data Engine catalog.\n\n\n\nThe SQL syntax itself is the full syntax that is supported by Data Engine except for the INTO clause. An INTO clause is implicitly added by the driver based on the Cloud Object Storage location that is given with the targetcosurl connection property.\n\nResults in the targetcosurl location are never deleted by the driver.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00491-7-1604", "score": 0.8243680596351624, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloudant Query \n\nIn this tutorial, we demonstrate how to create an index and use the index to query the database.

We recommend that you use the _explain mechanism to check each IBM Cloudant query to ensure it is using an index before you deploy to production.\n\nFor example, a type=json index on firstname, surname and date is suitable for finding documents for:\n\n\n\n* A known firstname, lastname, and date.\n* A known firstname, lastname, and a range of date values (that use $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte operators).\n* A known firstname and lastname sorted by date.\n\n\n\nIt can also be used to assist queries on firstname, surname, date, and other attributes.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 0.8123822212219238, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}]}

Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry. Then, [install the open source Portieris project](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) admission controller to block container deployments from unsigned images.\n3. Regularly scan running containers:. Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Depending on the app, to add extra security, you can establish a job that takes down vulnerable containers after they are detected.\n\n\n\nYou can use the built-in container registry to automate the container image build process from your source code in an external source repository to your internal registry. However, images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the internal registry. To set up image scanning, set up a registry namespace and push your images to the managed IBM Cloud Container Registry instead.\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01535-6381-8675", "score": 0.7053670883178711, "text": "\nThis action happens dynamically every time Vulnerability Advisor is queried.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Container Registry benefits\n\n Benefit Description \n\n Highly available and scalable private registry.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07949-12261-14447", "score": 0.8195402026176453, "text": "\nCombined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Container Registry \n\nUse [Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview) to store and access private container images.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01438-3222-5394", "score": 0.8095709681510925, "text": "\n* You're using an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster in a [configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-registrycluster_registry_auth_private) that automatically talks to the registry over a private connection.\n* You're accessing Container Registry through a virtual private cloud (VPC) virtual private endpoint gateway (VPE gateway).\n* You're using the Container Registry private IP addresses for configuring network access, for example, in firewalls or Access Control Lists (ACL).\n\n\n\nIf any of the previous statements is true when this change takes effect, the IP addresses in the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker logs change, but you don't need to do anything unless you are also using IAM IP address access restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n What actions you need to take \n\nYou must take the appropriate actions before 23 June 2022.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

This information contains instructions for using the problem-determination resources that are provided with your IBM products, including IBM Watson\u2122 Knowledge Studio.\n\n\n\n Techniques for troubleshooting problems \n\nTroubleshooting is a systematic approach to solving a problem. The goal of troubleshooting is to determine why something does not work as expected and how to resolve the problem. Certain common techniques can help with the task of troubleshooting.\n\nThe first step in the troubleshooting process is to describe the problem completely. Problem descriptions help you and the IBM technical-support representative know where to start to find the cause of the problem. This step includes asking yourself basic questions:\n\n\n\n* What are the symptoms of the problem?\n* Where does the problem occur?\n* When does the problem occur?\n* Under which conditions does the problem occur?\n* Can the problem be reproduced?\n\n\n\nThe answers to these questions typically lead to a good description of the problem, which can then lead you to a problem resolution.\n\n\n\n What are the symptoms of the problem? \n\nWhen starting to describe a problem, the most obvious question is \"What is the problem?\" This question might seem straightforward; however, you can break it down into several more-focused questions that create a more descriptive picture of the problem. These questions can include:\n\n\n\n* Who, or what, is reporting the problem?\n* What are the error codes and messages?\n* How does the system fail? For example, is it a loop, hang, crash, performance degradation, or incorrect result?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Where does the problem occur? \n\nDetermining where the problem originates is not always easy, but it is one of the most important steps in resolving a problem. Many layers of technology can exist between the reporting and failing components. Networks, disks, and drivers are only a few of the components to consider when you are investigating problems.\n\nThe following questions help you to focus on where the problem occurs to isolate the problem layer:\n\n\n\n* Is the problem specific to one platform or operating system, or is it common across multiple platforms or operating systems?\n* Is the current environment and configuration supported?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-troubleshooting"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04513-20461-20769", "score": 0.6165300607681274, "text": "\n}(U_{1}^{(1,0)}(t)+U_{3}^{(1,4)}(t)+U_{2}^{(1,2)}(t))\\sigma_{1}^{X} \\\\ u0026 + \\Omega_{d,2}(U_{5}^{(2,3)}(t)+U_{4}^{(2,1)}(t))\\sigma_{2}^{X} + \\Omega_{d,3}(U_{6}^{(3,2)}(t)+U_{7}^{(3,5)}(t))\\sigma_{3}^{X} \\\\ u0026 + \\Omega_{d,4}(U_{9}^{(4,7)}(t)+U_{8}^{(4,1)}(t))\\sigma_{4}^{X} + \\Omega_{d,5}(U_{11}^{(5,8)}(", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-quantum-computing-cli"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11511-20489-20797", "score": 0.6165300607681274, "text": "\n}(U_{1}^{(1,0)}(t)+U_{3}^{(1,4)}(t)+U_{2}^{(1,2)}(t))\\sigma_{1}^{X} \\\\ u0026 + \\Omega_{d,2}(U_{5}^{(2,3)}(t)+U_{4}^{(2,1)}(t))\\sigma_{2}^{X} + \\Omega_{d,3}(U_{6}^{(3,2)}(t)+U_{7}^{(3,5)}(t))\\sigma_{3}^{X} \\\\ u0026 + \\Omega_{d,4}(U_{9}^{(4,7)}(t)+U_{8}^{(4,1)}(t))\\sigma_{4}^{X} + \\Omega_{d,5}(U_{11}^{(5,8)}(", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-quantum-computing-cli"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14706-11693-12069", "score": 0.6160939931869507, "text": "\n* [Overview of VMware Solutions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-solution_overview)\n* [Veeam on bare metal server introduction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-bms-archi-intro)\n* [Veeam Backup and Replication 12 overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeamvm_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-cr-sa-ire"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08671-81982-83235", "score": 0.6160752177238464, "text": "\n* [Before you begin](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-recover-master-key-recovery-crypto-unitrecover-master-key-prerequisites)\n* [Recovering master keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-recover-master-key-recovery-crypto-unitrecover-master-key-step)\n* [What's next](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-recover-master-key-recovery-crypto-unitrecover-master-key-next)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enabling crypto mechanisms \n\n[Enabling crypto mechanisms](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-enable-mechanismsenable-mechanisms)\n\n\n\n* [Enabling BIP32 deterministic wallets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-enable-mechanismsenable-BIP32)\n* [Enabling Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-enable-mechanismsenable-EdDSA)\n* [Enabling the Schnorr algorithm](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-enable-mechanismsenable-schnorr)\n* [What's next](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-enable-mechanismsnext-enable-mechanisms)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding or removing crypto units \n\n[Adding or removing crypto units](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-add-remove-crypto-unitsadd-remove-crypto-units)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-sitemap"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08671-8907-10259", "score": 0.6156609654426575, "text": "\n* [Post-quantum cryptography support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grep11-introgrep11-support-post-quantum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n About key rotation -

Provisioning scripts can be any file that the operating system (OS) can run, including combined binary files or any OS-supported language. Provisioning scripts can't be used on cloud-init images. For more information, see [Provisioning scripts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-provisioning-scripts). \n User data You can add user data that automatically performs common configuration tasks or runs scripts. User data can be used on cloud-init and non-cloud-init images. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Attached storage disks \n\nIf you need extra storage, you can attach storage disks to your instance. The type of storage disks that are available to you depend on the profile that you select. For example, balanced local profiles and a few of the GPU profiles use local storage disks. If you select monthly billing, you can add IBM Cloud Backup for Classic and choose the option that best fits your needs. For more information, see [IBM Cloud Backup for Classic services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-getting-started).\n\n\n\n\n\n Network interface \n\n\n\nTable 3.

These virtual uplinks are backed by redundant physical uplinks to the IBM public and dedicated networks. The public and dedicated speed is always the same at the time of order, with the option to upgrade or downgrade a link if needed. If you select the 100 Mbps rate-limited option, the maximum instance throughput is limited only by the physical bandwidth available to the virtual server host. If you select the 1 Gbps non rate-limited option, you can achieve higher network performance through extra configuration.

Recently, you might have heard about Heroku changing their policy on free - the free tier. It's causing a challenge for a lot of developers out there so I want to take a handful of moments here to show you how you can migrate from Heroku to Code Engine from IBM Cloud in just a handful of steps. So let's go ahead and start playing around with it and see how quickly you can actually make your system work.\n\nSo first thing first, if you haven't seen it this is the actual line inside the official blog from Heroku, starting on November 28, 2022, we plan to stop free - offering the free product plans and plan on shutting down the free dynos and data services. We'll be sending out a series of email communications to affected users. This is challenging for a lot of beginner beginner web applications. I know for a fact personally I used Heroku when I first started back in the day so this is a pretty large hit for a lot of people and I want to show you how easy it is to convert from Heroku to Code Engine.\n\nSo first thing first, let's actually see a nice little application I've created. If I go ahead and bring up my application here, we have a nice little flask app. If you don't know what python is or flask is, it's a it's a format for python to be able to run an application on a standard port. So let's say we have this application; it says \u201cHello World!\u201d. I've already deployed it and we can check out right here We have our amazing production app at heroku.com. It says \u201chello world\u201d and we want to go ahead and change it. We wanted to update it so I'm going to go ahead and quickly update it to \u201cHello Moving from Heroku to Code Engine\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and come out of it. git add .git commit -m \u201cupdate hello line\u201d.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11110-13445-14738", "score": 0.6247559785842896, "text": "\nFor copies of the source code for this software, send an email to [devlic@us.ibm.com](mailto:devlic@us.ibm.com) identifying the IBM product and the AGPL-licensed program for which you are requesting the source code.\n\nGOLANGCI-LINT\n\n\n\n\n\n Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license \n\nThe Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the Creative Commons Attribute 2.5 License:\n\nGuardedBy.java ([https://github.com/stephenc/jcip-annotations/blob/master/src/main/java/net/jcip/annotations/GuardedBy.java](https://github.com/stephenc/jcip-annotations/blob/master/src/main/java/net/jcip/annotations/GuardedBy.java)), JCIP-ANNOTATIONS ([https://github.com/stephenc/jcip-annotations](https://github.com/stephenc/jcip-annotations)), net.jcip.annotations ([https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.jcip/jcip-annotations](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.jcip/jcip-annotations))\n\nThe URL to the license is [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/)\n\n\n\n\n\n Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Generic \n\nThe Program includes some or all of the following works licensed under the Creative Commons.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers.

It is Your responsibility to keep Your payment information current. If You do not elect automatic renewal, You have the responsibility of manually renewing Your domain by the expiration date. If You fail to manually renew in a timely fashion the domain name will be cancelled and You will no longer have use of that name. You agree that IBM Cloud will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that You fail to renew, either automatically or manually. If You do fail to renew Your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. (Current fees for post-expiration renewal can be found here: [https://www.ibm.com/cloud/dns](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/dns)). If You signed up for any other services in conjunction with Your domain registration, these services may be automatically renewed when Your domain registration is renewed, and You may incur additional renewal fees unless You cancel in advance.

The code itself must meet some structural requirements, such as the input parameters and the output results. It might also need to be packaged into a single file that includes all its dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Determine your event source \n\nThink about your function in terms of the event you want to happen to trigger code to run. Maybe you want code to run on every commit to a GitHub repository. Or maybe you want your code to run every time that an update is made in a Cloudant database.\n\nAfter you choose an event to trigger your function, review the packages that are already available to use. You might be able to use one to simplify your function development. If not, you can create your own package for your event source.\n\nYou might need to go back to your code and make some revisions based on your event selections.\n\n\n\n\n\n Organize deployments across environments \n\nDecide how you want to deploy your functions across environments, such as development, staging, and production environments.\n\nBecause Cloud Functions is a Cloud Foundry-based service, you can manage the deployment of your functions in the Cloud Foundry organizations and spaces that are provided for you in IBM Cloud. To organize your functions across these environments, you might choose to create one organization per function. Then, create a space for each environment you need. Instead, you could also have one organization for each environment and create a space per function. No matter how you arrange your organizations and spaces, choose a structure that you can use to effectively manage your function entities.\n\nYou can also use [namespaces](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-namespaces) to isolate resources. Each IBM Cloud space contains an Open Whisk namespace by default.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift.

For more information, see the Discovery [API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery-dataquery). For an overview of query concepts, see the [Query overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-concepts).\n\nQueries that are written in the Discovery Query Language can include both search and structure parameters.\n\nThe default values for query parameters can differ by project type. For more information about default values, see [Default query settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-defaults).\n\n\n\n Search parameters \n\nUse search parameters to search your collection, identify a result set, and analyze the result set.\n\nThe results set is the group of documents that are identified by the combined searches of the search parameters. The results set might be significantly larger than the returned results. If an empty query is submitted, the results set is equal to all the documents in the collection.\n\nDocuments that you do not have permissions to access are not returned in query results.\n\n\n\n\n\n Answer finding \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nThe find_answers parameter is supported in managed deployments only.\n\nBy default, Discovery provides answers by returning the entire [passage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameterspassages) that contains the answer to a natural language query. When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00644-18756-19998", "score": 0.693142294883728, "text": "\nGET $SERVICE_URL/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_view/$VIEW_NAME?start_key=\"alpha\"&end_key=\"beta\" HTTP/1.1\n\nSee the example of a global query that includes start_key and end_key query arguments.\n\nClient libraries use POST method instead of GET because they have the same behavior.\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl -X GET \"$SERVICE_URL/users/_design/allusers/_view/getVerifiedEmails?start_key=\"alpha\"&end_key=\"beta\"\"\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostViewOptions;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.ViewResult;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nPostViewOptions viewOptions = new PostViewOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"users\")\n.ddoc(\"allusers\")\n.view(\"getVerifiedEmails\")\n.startKey(\"alpha\")\n.endKey(\"beta\")\n.build();\n\nViewResult response =\nservice.postView(viewOptions).execute()\n.getResult();\n\nSystem.out.println(response);\n\nconst { CloudantV1 } = require('@ibm-cloud/cloudant');\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({});\n\nservice.postView({\ndb: 'users',\nddoc: 'allusers',\nview: 'getVerifiedEmails',\nstartKey: 'alpha',\nendKey: 'beta'\n}).then(response => {\nconsole.log(response.result);\n});\n\nfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1\n\nservice = CloudantV1.new_instance()", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-views"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02457-2791-4729", "score": 0.6911990642547607, "text": "\nYou can define query parameters to refine the events that you want to export.\n\nThe following table lists the query parameters that you can set:\n\n\n\nQuery parameters\n\n Query parameter Type Status Description \n\n from int32 Required Start time.

For example, some SIP trunk providers prefer to have the assistant send a SIP REFER request, so they can put the call on hold themselves.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the SIP protocol, see [RFC 3261](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261) and about the RTP protocol, see [RFC 3550](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550).\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring backup call center support \n\nWhen you use the phone integration as the first line of assistance for customers, it's a good idea to have a live agent backup available. You can design your assistant to transfer a call to a human in case the phone connection fails, or if a user asks to speak to someone.\n\nYour company might already have one or more phone numbers that connect to an automatic call dispatcher (ACD) that can queue callers until an appropriate agent is available. If not, choose a call center service to use as your backup.\n\nA conversation cannot be transferred from one integration type to another.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"}]}

When transfer_method is set to hangup instead of refer, the behavior of the transfer action changes. Instead of sending a SIP REFER request, the phone integration plays back any associated text and then hangs up the call by sending a SIP BYE request.\n\nAfter the hangup, the phone integration passes the transfer destination that is specified in the url attribute to the call anchor in the BYE message.

Most of the major SIP trunk providers have existing relationships with IBM. Therefore, the network configuration that is required to support the SIP trunk connection typically can be handled for you with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16250-5445-7809", "score": 0.6382172107696533, "text": "\nTo support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant.

After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06004-15614-17542", "score": 0.6582822799682617, "text": "\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team.

Review the following suggested guidelines for implementing best practices around your secrets management.\n\n\n\n Define your rotation strategy \n\nAs you use Secrets Manager to design your secrets management strategy, consider how often you want to rotate your secrets based on the internal guidelines for your organization. Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step. For more information about how Secrets Manager handles rotation requests, see [Manually rotating secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotationmanual-rotate-by-type).\n3.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13481-1627-2985", "score": 0.7302296161651611, "text": "\nDisplay your tables and run an SQL statement:\n\nspark.sql('show tables').show(truncate=False)\n\n replace yourTable with a valid table.

Each instance of Data Engine exports its catalog as a database called default.\n\n\n\n Catalog usage within Data Engine \n\nThe Catalog can be used in Data Engine in read and write mode. Seamless access is configured without any configuration steps needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Connecting Apache Spark with Data Engine \n\nWhen you use the Hive metastore compatible interface, access is limited to read only operations. Thus, existing tables and views can be used, but not modified.\n\nDepending from where you want to connect to your catalog, the steps may vary.\n\n\n\n Usage within Watson Studio Notebooks \n\nWatson Studio has the compatible Hive metastore client already included. It also includes a convenience library to configure the connection to the Hive metastore. Set the required variables (CRN and apikey) and call the helper function to connect to the Hive metastore:\n\n change the CRN and the APIkey according to your instance\ncrn='yourDataengineCRN'\napikey='yourAPIkey'\n\nfrom dataengine import SparkSessionWithDataengine\n\n call the helper function to create a session builder equipped with the correct config\nsession_builder = SparkSessionWithDataengine.enableDataengine(crn, apikey, \"public\")\nspark = session_builder.appName(\"Spark DataEngine integration test\").getOrCreate()\n\nDisplay your tables and run an SQL statement:\n\nspark.sql('show tables').show(truncate=False)\n\n replace yourTable with a valid table. Do not use the sample tables as you do not have access to the data!\nspark.sql('select * from yourTable').show()\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage with IBM Analytics Engine \n\nThe Hive metastore client is also already included in IBM\u00ae Analytics Engine.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-hive_metastore"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16636-0-1664", "score": 0.71388179063797, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Integrating Presto with Apache Hudi using a Hudi connector \n\nYou can integrate Presto with Apache Hudi by using the Hudi connector. You can query Hudi tables that are synced to Hive metastore (HMS) using Presto's SQL interface. This combination offers the benefits of fast and interactive analytics on large-scale, high-velocity data stored in Hudi. Hudi connector uses the metastore to track partition locations.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 0.7063522934913635, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 0.6511025428771973, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com. This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-ibm-cis-for-optimal-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16385-3291-4480", "score": 0.6374979615211487, "text": "\n* You can [prevent unauthorized access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt) to sensitive customer information by encrypting it and including it as part of the JWT user payload.\n\nThe user payload is a part of the JWT you can use to send information you want your assistant to have access to, but that you do not want customers to see.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

Service design should minimize the number of machines and people with access to secrets by using both authorization and network restrictions based on the principle of least privilege.\n* Secrets are rotated in according with the requirements of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services with minimal or no downtime.\n* Secrets are never stored in source code, configuration files, or documentation.\n\n\n\nThe following table lists the different solutions that you can use to protect your application secrets.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Secrets management and data protection scenarios\n\n Scenario What to use \n\n You need to create, lease, and manage API keys, credentials, database configurations, and other secrets for your services and applications.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response.

In effect, one node with three slots might be equivalent to eleven dialog nodes.\n\n\n\nPrevious topic:[Controlling the dialog flow](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime)\n\nNext topic:[Dialog building tips](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tips)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tasks"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05713-121773-123392", "score": 0.6990644931793213, "text": "\n* [VLAN connections for worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworker-worker-nodes)\n* [Worker node communication across subnets and VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworker-worker-subnets)\n\n\n\n* [Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication: Service endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworkeruser-master)\n\n\n\n* [Public service endpoint only](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworkeruser-master-endpoint)\n* [Public and private cloud service endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworkeruser-master-pub-priv)\n* [Private service endpoint only](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworkeruser-master-private)\n\n\n\n* [Worker communication to other IBM Cloud services or on-premises networks](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworker-services-onprem)\n\n\n\n* [Communication with other IBM Cloud services over the private or public network](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworker-services-onprem-pub-priv)\n* [IBM Cloud\u00ae Direct Link for communication over the private network with resources in on-premises data centers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworker-services-onprem-direct-link)\n* [strongSwan IPSec VPN connection for communication over the public network with resources in on-premises data centers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basicsworker-services-onprem-strongswan)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_sitemap"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02952-3289-5462", "score": 0.6989097595214844, "text": "\nAdd meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it.

It contains a condition that must be met for the node to be processed by your assistant. At a minimum, it also contains a response. For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response. You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more. (If you want to learn more about complex dialogs, you can complete the [Building a complex dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial) tutorial.)\n\nThe node that you will add in this step is one that contains slots. Slots provide a structured format through which you can ask for and save multiple pieces of information from a user within a single node. They are most useful when you have a specific task in mind and need key pieces of information from the user before you can perform it.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template. Review available service plans and pricing information for each resource that you are about to create.

You can choose a standard IOPS profile with 3, 5, or 10 IOPS per GB performance. Volume capacity can be up to 16 TB and 48,000 IOPS.\n* Create a volume by using a custom profile. Choose IOPS performance from 100 IOPS to 48,000 IOPS, based on volume size up to 16 TB.\n* Attach a data volume to a virtual server instance.\n* Choose customer-managed encryption for your block storage boot or data volume, and secure your data with your own encryption keys.\n* View a list of volumes and select a volume to see its details.\n* Manage volumes: Rename or delete volumes, transfer volumes to a different instance, detach or reattach a volume, assign access to a volume, and access performance metrics.\n* Expand volume capacity to meet your needs.\n* Adjust IOPS up or down, for greater performance or when you want to reduce costs.\n* Adjust the volume bandwidth ratio for volumes that are attached to a virtual server instance.\n\n\n\nFor more information about this service, see [About Block Storage for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about).\n\n\n\n\n\n File Storage for VPC \n\nFile Storage for VPC is a zonal file storage offering that provides NFS-based file storage services.

When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance. Instances are available on the x86 architecture. After you provision an instance, you control and manage those infrastructure resources.\n\n\n\n How are virtual server instances for VPC different from other IBM virtual server offerings? \n\nIn the IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for Classic infrastructure offering, instances use native subnet and VLAN networking to communicate to each other within a data center (and single pod). Using subnet and VLAN networking in one pod works well until you must scale up or have large virtual resource demands that require resources to be created between pods. (Adding appliances for VLAN spanning can get expensive and complicated!)\n\nIBM Cloud VPC adds a network orchestration layer that eliminates the pod boundary, creating increased capacity for scaling instances. The network orchestration layer handles all of the networking for all virtual server instances that are within a VPC across regions and zones. With the software-defined networking capabilities that VPC provides, you have more options for multi-vNIC instances and larger subnet sizes.\n\nTo review and start deploying compute resources, see the following topics:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

An HPC workload can be as simple as a single core job or as complex as a job that needs hundreds to thousands of cores. HPC aggregates computing power (clustering) and can deliver much higher performance and solve large problems.\n\nMost of HPC workloads fall below the 1000 core range. There are some workloads that require a high number of cores up to and including 10k-50k. Execution time for an HPC workload can be simple and last only a few seconds, or it can be complex and take several days.\n\nAs an example, EDA (Electronic Design Simulation) workloads have component level simulation jobs that require millions of such jobs ran every day, but each single job requires a single core and approximately 10 seconds. Others such as Optical Proximity Correction can take multiple hours or even days depending on the size of the chip and the size of the HPC cluster.\n\nTypically HPC clusters contain a set of virtual machines and use the cluster to run multiple workloads. It all depends on the workload resource requirements and duration.\n\nTo address this range of characteristics, IBM Cloud\u00ae provides various VPC virtual machine (VM) configurations in different modes:\n\n\n\n* Balanced configurations that provide average 4 GB memory per core and can range 4 - 64 Gbps in network bandwidth\n* Compute-intensive configurations that provide 2 GB memory per core and a network of 4 - 80 Gbps\n* Memory-intensive configurations that provide 8 - 28 GB memory per core and a network of 2 - 80 Gbps\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Instance profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles).\n\nFor all of the configurations, the range of core count is 2 - 128 per virtual machine. There is a special ultra high memory virtual machine type that might be applicable for workloads that require more memory per core.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-spectrum-lsf?topic=ibm-spectrum-lsf-considerations-for-HPC-custer-compute-types"}]}

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume.

This option is available for classic infrastructure users.\n\n\n\nBy using VPE for VPC or service endpoints, you can privately connect to IBM Cloud platform services and service products in the catalog that support this type of private connectivity.\n\nGo to the [API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=api-docs) for the service that you want to connect to and see the Endpoint URLs section to view the endpoints for that service.\n\n\n\n Virtual private endpoints for VPC \n\nVPE for VPC provides private connectivity to select IBM Cloud services originating from the VPC network of your choosing, without traversing the public backbone. All connectivity is contained within IBM Cloud. By using a service that supports VPE for VPC, you can connect to the service from your VPC network by assigning the IP address of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service or service instance basis, depending on the service operation model.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-endpoints-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16080-7-1779", "score": 0.6871637105941772, "text": "\nPublic frontend and private backend in a Virtual Private Cloud \n\nThis tutorial may incur costs. Use the [Cost Estimator](https://cloud.ibm.com/estimator/review) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.\n\nThis tutorial walks you through creating your own IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with multiple subnets and a virtual server instance (VSI) in each subnet. A VPC is your own, private cloud on shared cloud infrastructure with logical isolation from other virtual networks.\n\nA subnet is an IP address range. It is bound to a single zone and cannot span multiple zones or regions. For the purposes of VPC, the important characteristic of a subnet is the fact that subnets can be isolated from one another, as well as being interconnected in the usual way. Subnet isolation can be accomplished by Security Groups that act as firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic for one or more virtual server instances.\n\nA good practice is to have a subnet used for resources that must be exposed to the outside world. Resources with restricted access that should never be directly accessed from the outside world are placed within a different subnet. Instances on such a subnet could be your backend database or some secret store that you do not want to be publicly accessible. You will define Security Groups to allow or deny traffic to the VSIs.\n\nIn short, using VPC you can:\n\n\n\n* create a software-defined network (SDN),\n* isolate workloads,\n* have fine control of inbound and outbound traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\n Objectives \n\n\n\n* Understand the infrastructure objects available for virtual private clouds\n* Learn how to create a virtual private cloud, subnets and server instances\n* Know how to apply security groups to secure access to the servers\n\n\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-public-app-private-backend"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03470-12577-13864", "score": 0.6862713694572449, "text": "\nVPC gives you the security of a private cloud, with the agility and ease of a public cloud.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption.

Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-1068047-1069909", "score": 0.6620926856994629, "text": "\nIf you manage your invoices through the IBM Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking Manage > Billing and usage, and selecting Invoices.

When you are confident on the feature that you want to roll out is working as intended, increase the percentage over time.\n\nPercentage rollout uses a hashing algorithm that generates a hash based on the rule set. This hash is used by the SDK to generate a percentage value for that user. The percentage value generated for that user is compared to the value set for the percentage rollout value, determines whether the user is eligible to receive that feature or not.\n\nFor example, the hash has partitions from 1 to 100,000. When you assign a feature flag, the hash assigns values from 1 to 100,000 to users in each partition. For example, when you assign 25% to a feature flag, App Configuration SDK delivers that feature to hash partitions from 1 to 25,000. If you change the percentage of users receiving that feature from 25% to 50%, partitions 25,001 to 50,000 would be added to the set of partitions already receiving that feature.\n\nPercentage rollout capability is available for Lite and Enterprise plans.\n\nFollowing are some of the percentage rollout scenarios:\n\n\n\n* If the feature flag is disabled, then SDK returns the default Disabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rules and no percentage rollout is set, then the SDK returns default Enabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rule and percentage rollout is set to 0%, then the SDK returns Disabled value for all users.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-feature-flags"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16471-27744-30058", "score": 0.6552127003669739, "text": "\n* A compilation error is introduced when an import view statement introduces a naming conflict with any create view or other import statement within the same module (not just within the current file).

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node. You can also reference a context variable from dialog node response conditions to show different reponses depending on a value provided by an external service or by the user.\n\nLearn more:\n\n\n\n* [Passing context from the application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-from-app)\n* [Passing context from node to node](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-node-to-node)\n* [Defining a context variable](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-var-define)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-context"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16258-2570-3569", "score": 0.6664960384368896, "text": "\n[Conversation filters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/analytics-conversations-filters.png)\n\nIf you search for a specific session ID, enclose your search in quotation marks to ensure you receive an exact match on the full ID with its numbers and hyphen characters, for example: \"9015ab9a-2e13-4627-ae33-4179b1125cb5\".\n\n\n\n\n\n Exploring conversations in detail \n\nTo explore individual conversations in detail, you can click on any of the utterances or conversation time stamps.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03273-13172-14845", "score": 0.7076066732406616, "text": "\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match.

Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

For example, an entity might be a city name that helps your dialog to distinguish which store the user wants to know store hours for. After you add entities, update your dialog to use them. Add dialog nodes that handle the many possible permutations of a request based on the entities that are found in the user input.\n\n\n\nAs you add training data, a natural language classifier is automatically added to the skill. The classifier model is trained to understand the types of requests that you teach your assistant to listen for and respond to.\n3. Create a search skill. Configure a connection to a Discovery instance. If the dialog is configured to perform a search or is not designed to answer a particular type of question, the assistant searches the configured external data sources to find a response.\n4. Add the skills to your assistant.\n5. Bring the assistant to your customers where they are by adding integrations.\n\nBuild your own client application as the user interface for the assistant. Or add the built-in web chat integration to your company website.\n\n\n\nRead more about these steps by following these links:\n\n\n\n* [Assistant overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-add)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-index"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03363-7585-9120", "score": 0.673166811466217, "text": "\nThe intent and entities filters are populated by the intents and entities in the skill, and not what is in the data source.

You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities.

For example, an entity might represent a city where the user wants to find a business location, or the amount of a bill payment. In the tool, the name of an entity is always prefixed with the @ character.\n\nYou can train the skill to recognize your entities by providing entity term values and synonyms, entity patterns, or by identifying the context in which an entity is typically used in a sentence. To fine tune your dialog, go back and add nodes that check for entity mentions in user input in addition to intents.\n\n\n\n![Diagram of a more complex implementation that uses intent, entity, and dialog.]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03282-4605-6541", "score": 0.6665993928909302, "text": "\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks.

See [Disambiguation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambiguation) for more details.\n* Handling multiple entities in input: If you want to evaluate only the value of the first detected instance of an entity type, you can use the syntax @entity == 'specific-value' instead of the @entity:(specific-value) format.\n\nFor example, when you use @appliance == 'air conditioner', you are evaluating only the value of the first detected @appliance entity.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03270-3352-5135", "score": 0.7421624064445496, "text": "\nAdd a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step.

You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03373-2953-4766", "score": 0.6634393930435181, "text": "\nAfter you identify the list of steps, you can then focus on writing engaging content to turn each interaction into a positive experience for your customer.\n\n![Diagram of a simple exchange between a customer and an actions skill step.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/action-skill-explained.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. The name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-4297-6315", "score": 0.6625922322273254, "text": "\nThe dialog node response is equivalent to a Then statement in If-Then-Else programming logic. \n Skill Does the work of the assistant.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

For example, an entity mention might trigger a node that is situated earlier in the dialog tree but is not enabled for disambiguation. If the same entity is the only condition for a node that is enabled for disambiguation, but is situated later in the tree, then it might not be added as a disambiguation option because your assistant never reaches it.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

In the node that conditions on the intent, enable multiple conditioned responses (Customize > Multiple conditioned responses).2.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02961-1432-3314", "score": 0.7345978021621704, "text": "\nSee [Defining what to do next](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-jump-to).\n* Before you enable digressions away from a node, test the most common user scenarios. And be sure that likely digressed-to nodes are configured to return. See [Digressions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-digressions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding responses \n\n\n\n* Keep answers short and useful.\n* Reflect the user's intent in the response.\n\nDoing so assures users that the bot is understanding them, or if it is not, gives users a chance to correct a misunderstanding.\n* Only include links to external sites in responses if the answer depends on data that changes frequently.\n* Avoid overusing buttons. Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do. For example, add multiple conditional responses to a single node to return different responses depending on details provided by the user. See [Conditional responses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-multiple).\n* Word your responses carefully. You can change how someone reacts to your system based simply on how you phrase a response. Changing one line of text can prevent you from having to write multiple lines of code to implement a complex programmatic solution.\n* Back up your skill frequently.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application.

For example, you might be creating an application that gains insights from medical records. To build the type system, you start looking at patient records to see what kinds of information must be captured. The patient records might all contain a field that describes what the patient ate for lunch. However, if the application will not use that information, do not add it to the type system. And in making the decision to make this omission, recognize that this means that sections of your patient record documents will be left unannotated. That is alright and even expected.\n\nMentions annotate a span of text; they do not replace the text. A type system is not an ontology for a domain. Expect to have general entity types such as MEDICATION_NAME instead of having an entity type for each medicine type. The document text will continue to contain the specific medicine name. It will just be enhanced with an annotation that identifies its type, which makes the information easier to find and extract programmatically.\n\nAs you get started, define 10 to 40 entity types and relation types.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs"}]}

For more information about deployments, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).\n\nPod\n: Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. Usually, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).\n\nApp\n: An app might refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You might deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate worker nodes.

The Heapster pod discovers all nodes in the cluster and queries usage information from each node's kubelet. You can find utilization graphs in the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nIngress ALB\n: Ingress is a Kubernetes service that you can use to balance network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to multiple apps in your cluster. To expose your apps over the public or private network, you must create an Ingress resource to register your apps with the Ingress application load balancer (ALB).

For more information, see [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n\nNamespace\n: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams. For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like kube-system or ibm-system. If you don't designate a namespace when you create a Kubernetes resource, the resource is automatically created in the default namespace. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).\n\nService\n: A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).\n\nDeployment\n: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations. You document a deployment in a configuration YAML file, and then apply it to the cluster. The Kubernetes master configures the resources and deploys containers into pods on the worker nodes with available capacity.\n: Define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06480-1160-2754", "score": 0.7192420363426208, "text": "\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https://developer.ibm.com/depmodels/cloud/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https://www.ibm.com/training/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/35-Connectivity.svg)](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/publiccloud/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06501-7-1686", "score": 0.7148670554161072, "text": "\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

Public inodes are used for files that are visible to the customer and private inodes are used for files that are used internally by the storage system. The maximum number of files setting is 2 billion. However, this maximum value can be configured only with volumes of 7.8 TB or larger. The maximum number of inodes that can be configured on a volume is calculated by taking the total allocated volume size in KB and dividing it by 4.

Refer to your OS Documentation for limits on the number of file shares that can be mounted.\n* How many files and directories are allowed for specific file volume sizes? What is the maximum number of inodes allowed per volume size?\n\nThe number of files a volume can contain is determined by how many inodes it has. An inode is a data structure that contains information about files. Volumes have both private and public inodes. Public inodes are used for files that are visible to the customer and private inodes are used for files that are used internally by the storage system. The maximum number of files setting is 2 billion. However, this maximum value can be configured only with volumes of 7.8 TB or larger. The maximum number of inodes that can be configured on a volume is calculated by taking the total allocated volume size in KB and dividing it by 4.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

For backward compatibility, both the interpretation and metadata attributes are included with the recognized entity object. The new system entity version is enabled automatically for dialog skills in the Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages. You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page. This settings page is not displayed in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills because use of the legacy version of the API is no longer supported for those languages.

The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously).

You can search the resource link titles to find what you're looking for quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n 29 October 2020 \n\nSystem entity support changes\n: For English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills only the new system entities API version is supported. For backward compatibility, both the interpretation and metadata attributes are included with the recognized entity object. The new system entity version is enabled automatically for dialog skills in the Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages. You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page. This settings page is not displayed in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills because use of the legacy version of the API is no longer supported for those languages. For more information about the new system entities, see [System entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities).\n\n\n\n\n\n 28 October 2020 \n\nIntroducing the actions skill!\n: The actions skill is the latest step in the continuing evolution of Watson Assistant as a software as a service application. The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously).

It is important to note that output views and exported views are orthogonal. For example, a view that is exported does not qualify as a view that is output. In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match.

Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame. The maximum session inactivity time allowed ranges from 5 minutes to 7 days, depending on your plan type. If you do not add the dialog skill to an assistant, it is your responsibility as the custom application developer to maintain any continuing information that the application needs.\n\nThe application can pass information to the dialog, and the dialog can update this information and pass it back to the application, or to a subsequent node. The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node. You can also reference a context variable from dialog node response conditions to show different reponses depending on a value provided by an external service or by the user.\n\nLearn more:\n\n\n\n* [Passing context from the application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-from-app)\n* [Passing context from node to node](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-node-to-node)\n* [Defining a context variable](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-var-define)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-context"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03026-7-2040", "score": 0.6763831377029419, "text": "\nDefining what's irrelevant \n\nTeach your dialog skill to recognize when a user asks about topics that it is not designed to answer.\n\nTo teach your assistant about subjects it should ignore, you can review your user conversation logs to mark utterances that discuss off-topic subjects as irrelevant.\n\nIntents that are marked as irrelevant are saved as counterexamples in the JSON workspace, and are included as part of the training data.

Instead of adding those topics as counterexamples which can be hard to find later, capture the customer input examples as new intents. But, don't link dialog nodes to the intents until you're ready.

Note that the Fabric version of all peers in the channel must be at least at the level of the application capability level and the channel capability level inherited from the ordering service.

However, if you close your account, any existing instances and keys are automatically hard deleted. Check out [Account cancelation and data deletion](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-complianceaccount-cancelation) for more information.\n\nIn the event that a key is no longer needed or should be removed, Key Protect allows you to delete and ultimately purge keys, an action that shreds the key material and makes any of the data encrypted with it inaccessible.\n\nDeleting a key moves it into a Destroyed state, a \"soft\" deletion in which the key can still be seen and restored for 30 days. After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame. After 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged.

Therefore, the version in cache is considered valid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: For event-driven content, purge your cache \n\nFor example, every time a new post is added to your blog, you could easily purge the CIS cache. It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https://www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com/\n* www.example.com/foo/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/\n* www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path. It can also simplify the number of purge calls made.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only) \n\nPurging by hostname is similar to purging by prefixes.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-faq"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14639-1516-2901", "score": 0.7619762420654297, "text": "\nEnsure that you do not have any NSX objects that are expanded into the secondary instance that you want to delete.\n3.

Click the overflow menu and select to import or export records.\n\nImport records - By default, a total of 3500 DNS records are allowed (imported and created on CIS). You can import multiple files, one at a time, as long as the total number of records is under the max limit. After importing, you are shown a summary with the number of records successfully added and the number that failed, along with the reason why each record failed.\n\nExport records - Use Export records to create a backup of your zone file, or export it to use with another DNS provider. When this menu option is clicked, the records are downloaded to the location specified by your browser settings (typically the Downloads folder). To select another folder location, change your browser's settings to prompt you for a location with each download.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring and managing your secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally sign DNS data so you can be assured it is valid.

If you don't know who the registrar is for the domain you're trying to add to CIS, it is unlikely you have the permission to update your domain's configuration at the registrar. Work with the owner of the domain in your organization to make the necessary changes.\n* I want to keep my current DNS provider for my domain (example.com). Can I delegate a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) from my current DNS provider to CIS?\n\nYes. The process is similar to adding a domain, but instead of the registrar, you work with the DNS provider for the higher level domain. When you add a subdomain to CIS, you are given two name servers to configure, as usual. You configure a Name Server (NS) record for each of the two name servers as DNS records within your domain being managed by the other DNS provider. When we are able to verify that the required NS records have been added, we activate your subdomain. If you do not manage the higher level domain within your organization, you must work with the owner of the higher level domain to get the NS records added.\n* What is TLS?\n\nTLS is a standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links between a web server and a browser in an online communication. A TLS certificate is necessary to create a TLS connection with a website and comprises the domain name, the name of the company, and additional data, such as company address, city, state, and country. The certificate also shows the expiration date and details of the issuing Certificate Authority (CA).\n* How Does TLS Work?\n\nWhen a browser initiates a connection with a TLS secured website, it first retrieves the site's TLS Certificate to check whether the certificate is still valid.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05124-1739-3554", "score": 0.6988861560821533, "text": "\nSelect the Page rules Tab from the options.\n3.

IBM Cloud focuses on protection across the entirety of the compute lifecycle, which includes everything from the build process and key management to the security of data services. IBM Cloud also provides a group of security services that can be used by application developers to secure their mobile and web apps. These elements combine to make IBM Cloud a platform with clear choices for secure application development.\n\nIn addition to our own diligence in creating and operating a secure cloud, IBM\u00ae also engages many different firms to assess the security and compliance of our cloud platform. For more information, see [IBM Cloud compliance programs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance) for a detailed list of certifications and attestations.\n\nIBM Cloud ensures security readiness by adhering to security policies that are driven by best practices in IBM for systems, networking, and secure engineering. These policies include practices such as source code scanning, dynamic scanning, threat modeling, and penetration testing. IBM Cloud follows the IBM Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) process for security incident management. See the [IBM Security Vulnerability Management (PSIRT)](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-security-vulnerability-management) site for details.\n\nIn addition to the regular penetration testing conducted by IBM and our partners, customers may conduct penetration testing of their VPC or Classic Infrastructure resources on IBM Cloud.

To protect your cluster against these security threats, you must make sure that you apply the latest IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Kubernetes security features and updates in all cluster components.\n\nThese components include:\n\n\n\n* [Kubernetes API server and etcd data store](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-securityapiserver)\n* [Worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-securityworkernodes)\n* [Network](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-securitynetwork)\n* [Persistent storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-securitystorage)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07974-2884-3919", "score": 0.7741612195968628, "text": "\nSecurity <br><br> * [Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-ha-dr)<br><br><br> <br><br> * [Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-ha-dr)<br><br><br> <br><br> * [App ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-ha-dr)<br><br><br> \n Logging and monitoring <br><br> * [Activity Tracker Event Routing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-ha-dr)<br> * [Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-ha-dr)<br> * [Flow Logs for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc?topic=vpc-ha-dr-vpc)<br><br><br> <br><br> * [Activity Tracker Event Routing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-ha-dr)<br> * [Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-ha-dr)<br><br><br> \n Integration <br><br> * [Event Streams](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-sla)<br><br><br>", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-high-availability"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07970-6815-7809", "score": 0.771993100643158, "text": "\nSecurity <br><br> * [Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/hs-crypto)<br><br><br> <br><br> * [Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/hs-crypto)<br><br><br> <br><br> * [App ID](https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-ui//)<br><br><br> \n Logging and monitoring <br><br> * [Activity Tracker Event Routing](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/atracker/atracker-v2)<br> * [Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-api-setup)<br> * [Flow Logs for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=api)<br><br><br> <br><br> * [Activity Tracker Event Routing](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/atracker/atracker-v2)<br> * [Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-api-setup)<br><br><br> \n Integration <br><br> * [Event Streams](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-admin_api)<br><br><br>", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-deployment-setup-environment"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10889-7-2058", "score": 0.7679395079612732, "text": "\nUnderstanding compliance in IBM Cloud \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae provides a secure cloud platform that you can trust.

Packets can be accepted or dropped according to only basic access control list (ACL) criteria, such as the source and destination fields in the IP or Transmission Control Protocols/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) headers. A stateless Brocade 5400 vRouter does not store connection information and has no requirement to look up every packet's relation to previous flows, both of which consume small amounts of memory and CPU time. Therefore, raw forwarding performance is best on a stateless system.

If a document is not shared across multiple annotation sets and human annotators, there is no inter-annotator agreement to calculate. When you add annotation sets to a task, ensure that the sets that you want to compare contain the same overlapping documents.

But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.\n\nGenerally, a type system that includes many entity types and relation types is open to more interpretation, thus inter-annotator agreement might be lower during the early phases of model development. Looking at the scores, you can see which entity types, for example, have low scores. These low scores are an indication that the annotation guidelines need to be improved. By looking at the scores between pairs of human annotators, you can identify whether a particular annotator consistently shows lower scores than others.

The annotation guidelines can do a lot to ensure that text is correctly and consistently annotated, but even the best guidelines are open to interpretation by humans. To obtain ground truth, you will want to spend time training and educating human annotators so that they can make the best judgments when analyzing domain content.\n\n\n\n Inter-annotator agreement \n\nAfter human annotators have annotated the documents, you must determine which documents to promote to ground truth. Start by reviewing the inter-annotator agreement scores. Documents with low scores are candidates to be rejected and returned to the human annotator for improvement.\n\nWhen calculating inter-annotator agreement scores, the system examines all overlapping documents in all annotation sets in the task, regardless of the status of the sets. Because you cannot accept or reject annotation sets until they are in the Submitted status, you might not want to evaluate inter-annotator agreement until all annotation sets are submitted, or you might want to limit your review to only the human annotators who submitted their completed annotation sets.\n\nThe inter-annotator agreement scores show how different human annotators annotated mentions, relations, and coreference chains. You can view the scores by comparing a pair of human annotators (for example, compare all of John's mention annotations to all of Mary's mention annotations). You can also view the scores by comparing specific documents (for example, compare the relation annotations that John made in one document to the relation annotations that Mary made in the same document).\n\nTo help you identify areas that require investigation, scores that fall below the value that you specified for the inter-annotator agreement threshold are highlighted in red. In early stages of your annotation project, you might find that relation scores are often worse than mention scores because a perfect relation annotation requires that the mentions that define the relationship be in agreement first.\n\nThe score in the All column is a Fleiss Kappa score. It represents how consistently the same annotation was applied by multiple human annotators across all overlapping documents in the task.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-build-groundtruth"}]}

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions. All objects in the bucket must be set with anonymous read or public read access.\n\nFor more information, see [Accelerate delivery of static files using a CDN](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-static-files-cdn).\n\n\n\n\n\n Path-based CDN mappings", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13406-6795-8870", "score": 0.6442336440086365, "text": "\nThe metrics indicate the progress and complexity of the engine's processing:\n\n\n\n* seen_by_engine is audio that the service has read and passed to the engine at least once.\n* received - seen_by_engine is audio that has been buffered at the service but has not yet been seen or processed by the engine.\n* The relationship between the times is received >= seen_by_engine >= transcription >= speaker_labels.\n\n\n\nThe following relationships can also be helpful in understanding the results:\n\n\n\n* The values of the received and seen_by_engine fields are greater than the values of the transcription and speaker_labels fields during speech recognition processing.

This type of update often includes changes to the Kubernetes API or other behaviors that you must prepare your cluster for. Remember that your worker nodes can only be one version behind the master version (n-1). You can update the classic worker node to the same patch by using the ibmcloud oc worker update command.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Update types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsupdate_types).\n\nWhat happens to my apps during an update?\n: If you run apps as part of a deployment on worker nodes that you update, the apps are rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster. These worker nodes might be in a different worker pool, or if you have stand-alone worker nodes, apps might be scheduled onto stand-alone worker nodes. To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload.\n\nHow can I control how many worker nodes go down at a time during an update or reload?\n: If you need all your worker nodes to be up and running, consider [resizing your worker pool](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_pool_resize) or [adding stand-alone worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_add) to add more worker nodes. You can remove the additional worker nodes after the update is completed.\n\nIn addition, you can create a Kubernetes config map that specifies the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time, such as during an update. Worker nodes are identified by the worker node labels. You can use IBM-provided labels or custom labels that you added to the worker node.\n\nThe Kubernetes config map rules are used for updating worker nodes only.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06293-1474-1824", "score": 0.6398875713348389, "text": "\n* Updates the following sidecar images:\n\n\n\n* storage-secret-sidecar to v1.2.24.\n* csi-node-driver-registrar to v2.7.0.\n* livenessprobe to v2.9.0.\n* csi-provisioner to v3.4.1.\n* csi-attacher to v4.2.0.\n* csi-resizer to v1.7.0.\n* csi-snapshotter to v6.2.1.\n\n\n\n* Updates the UBI image 8.8-860.\n* Updates Golang to 1.19.10.\n* Resolves the following CVEs:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc_bs_changelog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10667-1478-2440", "score": 0.6364420056343079, "text": "\nChange log for version 1.1, released 3 July 2023 \n\n\n\n* Updates the following sidecar images:\n\n\n\n* storage-secret-sidecar to v1.2.24.\n* csi-node-driver-registrar to v2.7.0.\n* livenessprobe to v2.9.0.\n* csi-provisioner to v3.4.1.\n* csi-resizer to v1.7.0.\n\n\n\n* Updates the UBI image 8.8-860.\n* Updates Golang to 1.19.10.\n* Resolves the following CVEs:\n\n\n\n* [CVE-2023-29403](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29403),\n* [CVE-2023-29404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29404)\n* [CVE-2023-29405](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29405)\n* [CVE-2023-29402](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29402)\n* [CVE-2023-29400](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29400)\n* [CVE-2023-24540](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24540)\n* [CVE-2023-24539](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24539)\n* [CVE-2022-43552](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43552)\n* [CVE-2022-3204](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3204)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-versions-vpc-file-addon"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06293-20226-21273", "score": 0.6355088353157043, "text": "\n* Updates the storage-secret-sidecar image to v1.2.10\n* Updates the csi-node-driver-registrar to v2.5.0\n* Updates the livenessprobe to v2.6.0\n* Updates the csi-provisioner to v3.2.1\n* Updates the csi-attacher to v3.5.0\n* Updates the csi-resizer to v1.5.0\n* Resolves the following CVEs: [CVE-2022-37434](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37434), [CVE-2022-2509](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2509), [CVE-2022-40674](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40674), [CVE-2020-35525](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35525), [CVE-2020-35527](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35527), [CVE-2022-3515](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3515)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Change log for version 4.3.7_1613, released 22 September 2022 \n\n\n\n* Updates the storage-secret-sidecar image to v1.1.15.\n* Updates the golang version to 1.18.6.\n* Resolves the following CVEs: [CVE-2022-27664](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27664) and [CVE-2022-32190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32190).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc_bs_changelog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10699-20221-21268", "score": 0.6355088353157043, "text": "\n* Updates the storage-secret-sidecar image to v1.2.10\n* Updates the csi-node-driver-registrar to v2.5.0\n* Updates the livenessprobe to v2.6.0\n* Updates the csi-provisioner to v3.2.1\n* Updates the csi-attacher to v3.5.0\n* Updates the csi-resizer to v1.5.0\n* Resolves the following CVEs: [CVE-2022-37434](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37434), [CVE-2022-2509](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2509), [CVE-2022-40674](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40674), [CVE-2020-35525](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35525), [CVE-2020-35527](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35527), [CVE-2022-3515](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3515)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Change log for version 4.3.7_1613, released 22 September 2022 \n\n\n\n* Updates the storage-secret-sidecar image to v1.1.15.\n* Updates the golang version to 1.18.6.\n* Resolves the following CVEs: [CVE-2022-27664](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27664) and [CVE-2022-32190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32190).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc_bs_changelog"}]}

In addition to creating a DetaggedDoc view, the annotate clause creates an auxiliary view called Anchor. This auxiliary view has two columns. One column, called match, contains the anchor text. The other column, called linkTarget, contains the actual target of the link as text. The spans in the match column are over the text value of the DetaggedDoc view.\n\ndetag Document.text as DetaggedDoc\nannotate\n'a' as Anchor\nwith attribute 'href' as linkTarget;\n\nExample 2: Using the Remap function\n\nThe following example illustrates how the Remap function is used to map spans from the detagged text back to their equivalents in the original source.\n\n-- Strip out tags from each document, provided that the document\n-- is in HTML or XML format.\n-- Remember the locations and content of all <A> and <META> tags\n-- in the original source document.\ndetag Document.text as DetaggedDoc\ndetect content_type always", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16471-74601-76664", "score": 0.6278892159461975, "text": "\nFor all supported languages, the Multilingual tokenizer uses the part-of-speech tags that are listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n Tag Descriptions \n\n ADJ adjective \n ADP adposition \n ADV adverb \n AUX auxiliary \n CCONJ coordinating conjunction \n DET determiner \n INTJ interjection \n NOUN noun \n NUM numeral \n PART particle \n PRON pronoun \n PROPN proper noun \n PUNCT punctuation \n SCONJ subordinating conjunction \n SYM symbol \n VERB verb \n X other \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nExample 1: Using a part of speech tag directly in an extract statement\n\nThe view EnglishNoun extracts English nouns (singular or mass) or proper nouns (singular).\n\ncreate view EnglishNoun\nas extract parts_of_speech 'NOUN' and 'PROPN'\nwith language 'en' on D.text\nas noun from Document D;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sequence patterns \n\nUse the pattern extraction specification to perform pattern matching across an input document and other spans extracted from the input document.\n\n\n\n Syntax \n\nThe general syntax of a sequence pattern is to first specify the pattern to be matched in the text, and then to specify what is to be returned by the extractor.

Each packet is tagged with the proper VNI (virtualized network identifier) to maintain data isolation. The flows are then sent to the destination hypervisor that hosts the destination virtual server instance. The destination hypervisor strips off the VNI and forwards the data packet to the destination virtual server instance.\n\nInter-subnet, intra-zone data flows - These flows involve packets that use the VPC's implicit router function, which connects all subnets that are created in the VPC. It routes the data packet to the correct destination hypervisor. If the destination hypervisor is different from the source hypervisor, the data packet is tagged with the proper VNI and sent to the destination hypervisor. There, the VNI is stripped off and the data packet is forwarded to the destination virtual server instance. (These last steps are the same as described in the previous type of data flow.)\n\nInter-subnet, inter-zone data flows - For these flows, the implicit router function removes the VNI and forwards the packet in the VPC's MPLS VPN for transit across the cloud backbone.

Then, the packet is forwarded to the destination hypervisor, where the VNI is stripped off again so that the data packet can be forwarded to the destination virtual server instance.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13079-7-2117", "score": 0.691865086555481, "text": "\nFAQs \n\nYou can read the following FAQs to help you with Hyper Protect Virtual Servers.\n\n\n\n Are there any backup functions provided for a virtual server? \n\nHyper Protect Virtual Servers does not provide any backup functions for your virtual server instances. If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 / 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance. Service availability is defined within the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Service Description](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/pdf/6605-17/$file/i126-6605-17_06-2019_en_US.pdf).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the data center have an impact on performance and reliability of a virtual server? \n\nNo, all of the data centers are of the same quality. For best availability, follow the hints in question [How do I provide my applications in high availability?]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16030-7-2126", "score": 0.6906283497810364, "text": "\nVPC behind the curtain \n\nThe following information presents a detailed conceptual picture of what's happening \"behind the curtain\" in VPC networking. Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07717-7794-9268", "score": 0.679462730884552, "text": "\nNIST supplemental guidance \n\nInformation systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-cm-7"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14726-9552-10794", "score": 0.6771926879882812, "text": "\n* [Cyber recovery with Veeam architecture overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions/?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-cr-sa-overview)\n* [Juniper vSRX overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-juniper-overview)\n* [Managing Juniper vSRX](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-juniper-managing)\n* [Juniper Networks vSRX deployment and operation with vCenter Server on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vcsvsrx-intro)\n* [Managing VLANs with a gateway appliance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/gateway-appliance?topic=gateway-appliance-managing-vlans-and-gateway-appliances)\n* [IBM Cloud IP ranges](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/gateway-appliance?topic=cloud-infrastructure-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges)\n* [VLANs and subnets in IBM Cloud\u00ae for VMware Solutions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmwaresol_ports-vlans-subnets)\n* [Ports that are used for deployment and Day 2 operations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmwaresol_ports-deploy-day2ops)\n* [Ports used by IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmwaresol_ports-vmwareuses)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-cr-sag-vsrx"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14549-16227-18518", "score": 0.6715843677520752, "text": "\nConfiguration is required for access to the internet and the IBM Services network.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "score": 0.7008748650550842, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair.

The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for a standard customer. You do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such, but you must pass this information to your action so it can change the flow of the conversation. To do this, you can pass the customer MVP status as an encrypted variable. This private context variable is available for use by the action, but not by anything else.\n\n![development icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/development-icon.png)Tutorial: For a tutorial that shows an example of using web chat security to authenticate users and protect sensitive data, see [Tutorial: Authenticating a user in the middle of a session](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-security).\n\nTo encrypt sensitive data:\n\n\n\n1.

For more information, see [Applying advanced customizations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-config).\n\n\n\n\n\n Launcher appearance and behavior \n\nThe web chat launcher welcomes and engages customers so they know where to find help if they need it. By default, the web chat launcher appears in a small initial state as a circle in the bottom right corner:\n\n![An example of the initial launcher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-icon.png)\n\nAfter 15 seconds, the launcher expands to show a greeting message to the user. In this expanded state, a customer can still click the launcher to open the web chat. (If the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page before the launcher has expanded, the 15-second timer restarts.) There are two slightly different appearances for this expanded state, depending on whether the user is using a desktop browser or a mobile browser.\n\n\n\n* For desktop browsers, the expanded launcher shows two primary buttons the customer can click to open the web chat, and a Close button that closes the launcher:\n\n![An example of the desktop launcher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/desktop-launcher.png)\n\nThe expanded launcher remains in its expanded state even if the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.6503353118896484, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

You can move the image back and forth through all the statuses and set dates to automatically change an image status. All status changes are tracked as an Activity Tracker event. You can filter your list of images based on status to aid in clean-up or tracking of your images.

Using the deprecated status can discourage use of the image before changing the status to obsolete. \n obsolete You can't use the image to create an instance. If you try to use an obsolete image to create an instance, you receive a message that states that you can't use the image to create an instance. This status allows a reversible disabling of an image before you delete the image. \n\n\n\nAny image that is in deprecated or obsolete status is still billed. If you don't want to be billed for the image, you must delete it.\n\nIBM Cloud VPC managed images can be managed only this way. Custom images that are published to a private catalog must be in available status and their statuses are maintained in the private catalog. If you try to change or schedule a change to their status in IBM Cloud VPC, the attempt fails. If a custom image is removed from a private catalog, that image retains its original private catalog status until the status is changed in IBM Cloud VPC.\n\n\n\nTable 2.

If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant. After your assistant is live, the built-in metrics of active user conversations help you understand what your customers are asking about, how well your assistant is able to meet their needs, and what to focus on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n 3. Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant.

Use the following SpEL expression in a response to repeat the text that the user specified back in the response:\n\nYou said: <? input.text ?>.\n\nIf autocorrection is on, and you want to return the user's original input before it was corrected, you can use <? input.original_text ?>. But, be sure to use a response condition that checks whether the original_text field exists first.\n* Determining the number of words in user input: You can perform any of the supported String methods on the input.text object. For example, you can find out how many words there are in a user utterance by using the following SpEL expression:\n\ninput.text.split(' ').size()\n\nSee [Expression language methods for String](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methodsdialog-methods-strings) to learn about more methods you can use.\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks. I want to open a savings account and apply for a credit card. How does the dialog recognize and address both of them?

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in.

For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13074-16820-18514", "score": 0.722481369972229, "text": "\nEmotion Analysis can detect emotions that are associated with targeted phrases, entities, or keywords, or it can analyze the overall emotional tone of your content.\n\nExample portion of a document enriched with Emotion Analysis:\n\n{\n\"text\": \"The stockholders were pleased that Acme Corporation plans to build a new factory in Atlanta, Georgia.\",\n\"enriched_text\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"document\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"disgust\": 0.102578,\n\"joy\": 0.626655,\n\"anger\": 0.02303,\n\"fear\": 0.018884,\n\"sadness\": 0.096802\n}\n}\n}\n\nIn the preceding example, you could query the joy Emotion by accessing enriched_text.emotion.document.emotion.joy\n\nEmotion Analysis analyzes your text and calculates a score for each emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness) on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-index"}]}

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-25501-27738", "score": 0.6592326164245605, "text": "\n* New [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant) focuses on the workflow of building, deploying, and improving your assistant.\n\n\n\nYou can easily switch to the new Watson Assistant and try it out.

This model is now available in dialog skills using French, Italian, and Spanish.\n\nChange to the irrelevance detection option\n: As of this release, new English dialog skills no longer include the option to choose between the Enhanced or Existing irrelevance detection.

For example, you can now expect the same confidence score for the following two inputs: ik ben een kleine krijger? and ik ben een kleine krijger. In this example, the question mark (?) doesn't affect the confidence score.\n\nImproved enhanced intent detection\n: The exact match in enhanced intent detection now better handles small differences between training examples and runtime utterances when the differences do not change the meaning of a sentence.\n\nFor example, suppose in your training examples, covid-19 is in the covid intent and @doctortype_facilitytype around Palm Beach is in the find_provide_master intent. In this example, the @doctortype_facilitytype direct entity reference contains entity values, including hospital. At run time, covid19 is predicted as 100% confident for the covid intent, and hospital around palm beach is predicted as 100% confident for the find_provide_master intent.\n\nThis update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model.

You teach it about the types of things your customers want to know and do, and then design a script for the assistant to follow as it converses with your customers to help them accomplish their business goals.\n\n![Skills](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/skill-icon.png) An assistant routes your customer queries to a skill, which then provides the appropriate response. Dialog skills return responses that are authored by you to answer common questions, while search skills search for and return passages from existing self-service content to answer more complex inquiries.\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill can understand and address questions or requests that your customers typically need help with. You provide information about the subjects or tasks your users ask about, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n Dialog tree Graphical user interface \n\n You can use graphical tools to create a dialog for your assistant to read from when interacting with your users, a dialog that simulates a real conversation. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses. ![A sample dialog tree with example content](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/dialog-depiction.png) \n\n\n\nThe dialog skill itself is defined in text, but you can integrate it with Watson Speech to Text and Watson Text to Speech services that enable users to interact with your assistant verbally.\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13074-16820-18514", "score": 0.6925742030143738, "text": "\nEmotion Analysis can detect emotions that are associated with targeted phrases, entities, or keywords, or it can analyze the overall emotional tone of your content.\n\nExample portion of a document enriched with Emotion Analysis:\n\n{\n\"text\": \"The stockholders were pleased that Acme Corporation plans to build a new factory in Atlanta, Georgia.\",\n\"enriched_text\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"document\": {\n\"emotion\": {\n\"disgust\": 0.102578,\n\"joy\": 0.626655,\n\"anger\": 0.02303,\n\"fear\": 0.018884,\n\"sadness\": 0.096802\n}\n}\n}\n\nIn the preceding example, you could query the joy Emotion by accessing enriched_text.emotion.document.emotion.joy\n\nEmotion Analysis analyzes your text and calculates a score for each emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness) on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.
