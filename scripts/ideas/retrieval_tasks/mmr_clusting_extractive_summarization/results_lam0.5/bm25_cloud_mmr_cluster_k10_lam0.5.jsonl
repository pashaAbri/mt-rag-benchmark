The default is 2 hours.\n\nAn inactive user will see two messages. The first message alerts them about an upcoming session expiration and provides a choice to renew. If they remain inactive, a second session expiration message appears and they will need to log in again.\n\nFor more information, see [Setting the sign out due to inactivity duration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-work-sessions&interface=uisessions-inactivity).\n\n\n\n\n\n 18 May 2022 \n\nLanguage support improvements\n: Entity recognition and intent classification for Japanese and Korean languages changed to improve the reliability of Watson Assistant. You might see minor differences in how Watson Assistant handles entity recognition and intent classification. This change affects Watson Assistant workspaces that are trained after May 18, 2022. Workspaces that were trained before May 18, 2022 maintain the same behavior.\n\nAny visible changes are most likely to be seen in dictionary-based or pattern-based entity matching.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

You want the simple assistant to answer user questions about the restaurant, its menu, and to cancel customer cake orders. Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input. The General_About_You intent that is provided with the General content catalog serves a similar function, but its user examples are designed to focus on queries about the assistant as opposed to the business that is using the assistant to help its customers. So, you will add your own intent.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-tutorial"}]}

Is there a maximum? \n\nThere is a minimum and maximum number of days for which you can view metrics by using IBM Cloud\u00ae Content Delivery Network with Akamai. Historical metrics can be gathered for a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 90 days. Most recent metrics can be gathered for a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 48 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is the hit ratio nonzero when total hits are zero? \n\nHit ratio represents the percentage of times the content was delivered from the Edge server cache, rather than being delivered from the origin server. It is calculated as follows:\n\n((Edge hits - Ingress hits)/Edge hits)* 100\n\nWhere:\n\nEdge hits specifies all hits to the Edge servers from the users. Ingress hits specifies origin or ingress hits for traffic from your origin server to Akamai Edge servers.\n\nBecause Hit Ratio is calculated at the account level and not per CDN, the Hit Ratio is the same for all the CDNs in your account. This fact also explains why the Hit Ratio might be nonzero when the number of Edge hits for a particular CDN is zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n Are metrics updated in real time? \n\nThe most recent metrics can be updated every 5 minutes, while other metrics are updated every 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the time interval when you select Most recent from the Time frame list? \n\nThe time range and time interval relationships are shown.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Time range and time interval relationships\n\n Time range Time interval (minutes) \n\n (0, 60] 1 \n (60, 300] 5", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/CDN?topic=CDN-metrics"}]}

In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive.

While this method is not desirable, the WAN opt UI reveals a high ratio between LAN and WAN use when you move unused disk data.

Following are the three key concepts in RAID:\n\n\n\n* Mirroring: copying data to more than one disk\n* Striping: splitting data across more than one disk\n* Error correction (fault tolerance): redundant data is stored to allow problems to be detected and possibly fixed.\n\n\n\nAlthough many different levels of RAID exist, IBM chooses to support the most common RAID types: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity / Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05138-7979-9034", "score": 21.25385124092189, "text": "\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}]}

No passages are chosen from the remaining 70 documents.\n\n\n\nIf your goal is to get the best 10 short answers, a good approach is to give the answer-finding feature various passages from more documents than just the top 10. To do so, set passages.per_document to true, and then request 20 documents and up to 3 passages from each document with the answer-finding feature enabled. The answer-finding feature searches for answers in up to 20*3 = 60 passages.\n\nAnswer finding does not use the transformed query string that is generated by query analysis. Instead, it uses a copy of the user's original input that is stored at query time to find the best short answer.

Passages are returned per document by default. They are displayed as a section within each document query result and are ordered by passage relevance.\n\nDiscovery uses sentence boundary detection to pick a passage that includes a full sentence.

Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12824-7-1978", "score": 22.163602116557126, "text": "\nFAQs for migrated products \n\nFAQs about products that are migrated from the Resource Management Console might include questions about Lite plans, changing pricing plans, and brokers connected to approved pricing plans.\n\nTo find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see our [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n Why can't I add new block tier usage-based plans? \n\nBlock tier pricing plans are not currently supported in Partner Center. If you set up a block tier pricing plan in the Resource Management Console and the plan was approved and published, no changes have been made and it was migrated as-is with your product. However, you can't edit the plan or set up a new block tier pricing plan. If you have any questions, open a support case. For information about opening a support case, see [Creating a Partner Center support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-pc-supportpc-support-case).\n\n\n\n\n\n What changed with Lite plan support? \n\nLite plans are not supported in Partner Center. You can create a new free plan, and all users with Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts can try out your product for free.\n\nIf you set up a Lite plan in the resource management console, and it was approved and published, no changes have been made and it was migrated as-is with your product.

For information about opening a support case, see [Creating a Partner Center support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-pc-supportpc-support-case).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I add a broker per location? \n\nNo. Brokers are added per pricing plan, not per location. And, brokers can't be disconnected from already approved plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I set different locations per plan for a single product? \n\nYes. But, all plans for a single product must be set as either global or per location. Therefore, you can't have a plan that is set to global and then another plan set to be available for specific regions.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sell?topic=sell-migrated-products"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01705-2818-4572", "score": 22.0627619118584, "text": "\n[Feature available](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/4d8c6eec891cff72b666dc24bd3211810c77fb42/icons/icon_enabled.svg) \n Invoiced on monthly consumption ![Feature available](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/4d8c6eec891cff72b666dc24bd3211810c77fb42/icons/icon_enabled.svg) \n\n\n\nNew accounts as of 25 October 2021 are created as Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts.

You can use any available model for speech recognition. The Lite plan does not provide access to customization. You must use a paid plan to use customization.\n\nThe Lite plan is intended for any user who wants to try out the service before committing to a purchase.

It is a service that is provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG). \n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a Let's Encrypt ACME account \n\nTo connect with Let's Encrypt, Secrets Manager uses the [Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) protocol. The ACME protocol makes it possible to automatically obtain browser trusted certificates from a certificate authority without human intervention.\n\nYou can grant service access to Let's Encrypt by registering an ACME account and providing your account credentials. If you have a working ACME client or account for Let's Encrypt, you can use your existing private key. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one by using the [ACME account creation tool](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-security/acme-account-creation-tool).\n\nCertificate authorities can apply a charge when you are ordering or renewing a certificate.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-prepare-order-certificates&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01874-5054-7294", "score": 15.108008344016936, "text": "\nIf it's not already federated, a manual process with the IBMid federation team is required to establish federation. During the federation setup process, the customer collaborates with the IBMid federation team to define which email pattern matches with the IdP users. The decision to federate to your company's own user directory needs to involve the person in your company that can make company-wide decisions when it comes to connecting to external parties for identity services. You need to ensure that this person is included in the process. Federating with IBMid can have an impact on non-IBM Cloud web services that your company already uses with IBM. This option requires the creation of an App ID instance. It is a self-service option with a low usage fee. Choosing this option requires a custom URL to log in to IBM Cloud. In addition, an App ID instance and configuration of the federation to your IdP is required for every IBM Cloud account. \n Costs Customers do not need to pay to use IBMid with or without federation. IBM Cloud App ID instances have a low fee, with a free tier up to 1,000 users and 1,000 events (for example, logins). See the App ID page for more details. \n Federation setup Customers need to open a support case with IBMid Enterprise Federation to start the onboarding process. This is a manual process. Customer creates an IBM Cloud App ID instance and configures it according to the documented steps. This process is self-service. \n Federation maintenance (for example, certificate update) Requires a manual interaction with the IBMid federation team. The customer can update their IBM Cloud App ID instance on their own (for example, this step is self-service). \n Federation scope IBMid federation applies to every service that uses IBMid. This means that if a customer onboards to IBMid federation, this applies to his employees when logging on to IBM Cloud, but also when using other IBM SaaS offerings that are using IBMid.

The ICN is important because it allows IBM to identify your company and support contract. Without an ICN, you can't deploy the Spectrum Scale resources through IBM Cloud Schematics.\n\nIf the storage_type deployment value is set as either \"scratch\" or \"persistent\", the ICN can't be set as an empty value.

A typical scenario is the creation of a resource whose status field indicates when the creation process has completed.

This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.  In the Query workspace page, enter the query and click Run on starter to get the results.\n2.  Click Explain on the screen to visualize the graphical representation of the query.\n\n\n\nOn the Explain window, click a stage to view the details on the right window. The details of each stage that is displayed are the estimate values for rows, CPU, memory, and network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-explain_sql_query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13075-7-2200", "score": 18.32037921909156, "text": "\nImproving result relevance with the tooling \n\nThe relevance of natural language query results can be improved in IBM Watson\u2122 Discovery with training.

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

You can train your private collections using either the Discovery tooling, or the Discovery APIs. See [Improving the relevance of your query results with the API](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-api) if you would prefer to use the APIs.\n\nRelevancy training is optional; if the results of your queries meet your needs, no further training is necessary. For information about use cases for relevancy training, see [Improve your natural language query results from Watson Discovery](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/improving-your-natural-language-query-results-from-watson-discovery/).\n\nTo train Watson, you must provide the following:\n\n\n\n* Example queries that are representative of the queries your users enter\n* Ratings that indicate which results for each query are relevant and not relevant\n\n\n\nAfter Watson has enough training input, the information that you provide about which results are good and bad for each query is used to learn about your collection. Watson does not just memorize, but it also learns from the specific information about individual queries and applies the patterns it detects to all new queries. It does so, using machine-learning Watson techniques that find signals in your content and questions. After training, Discovery then reorders the query results to display the most relevant results at the top. As you add more and more training data, Discovery becomes more accurate in the ordering of query results.\n\nRelevance training currently applies only to natural language queries in private collections. It is not intended for use with structured Discovery Query Language queries. For more about the Discovery Query Language, see [Query concepts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-concepts).\n\nAll private collections return a confidence score in the query results in most cases.

This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.  In the Query workspace page, enter the query and click Run on starter to get the results.\n2.  Click Explain on the screen to visualize the graphical representation of the query.\n\n\n\nOn the Explain window, click a stage to view the details on the right window.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-4-2366", "score": 35.74146097124232, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-3131-4993", "score": 22.674945115244288, "text": "\n* Applies exemption policies to reports at an account, [namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_namespace), [repository](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_repository), or [tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_tag) level to mark when issues that are flagged do not apply to your use case.\n\n\n\nThe following functions are available in version 4:\n\n\n\n* Scans images for issues.\n* Provides an evaluation report that is based on security practices that are specific to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n* Provides instructions about how to fix a reported [vulnerable package](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexpackages) in its reports.\n* Applies exemption policies to reports at an account, [namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_namespace), [repository](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_repository), or [tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_tag) level to mark when issues that are flagged do not apply to your use case.\n\n\n\nThe Security status column in the Images tab of the Container Registry dashboard displays the number of issues that are associated with each image.

Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16468-14825-17168", "score": 19.329846506357306, "text": "\nTo connect the ground truth editor and adjudication tool to your annotation guidelines:\n\n\n\n1.

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings.

Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings. For more information, see [Asking clarifying questions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questionsunderstand-questions-ask-clarifying-question).\n* You publish a version of your assistant to the live environment.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-autolearn"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16390-1728-3821", "score": 17.57927137924076, "text": "\nAny action can be shown as a suggestion, unless its Ask clarifying question setting is set to Off.

In the Include a connection to support section, specify when you want an option to connect with support to be included in the list of suggestions. You can specify Always, Never, or After one failed attempt.\n\nAfter one failed attempt: Adds the option to the list only if the customer reached a node with an anything_else condition in the previous conversation turn or reaches the same action for a second time in succession.\n3. In the Option label field, type the text of the message that requests help from support. This message is shown as the label for the support option, which is included in the Suggestions window under the circumstances you specified in the previous step.

Another benefit is that copies of the pulled images from Container Registry are stored locally on the cluster, therefore reducing latency and external traffic, but you are subject to storage limitations.\n\nTo set up your Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud clusters to use the internal registry in combination with Container Registry, see the following topics in the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud documentation:\n\n\n\n* [Importing images from IBM Cloud Container Registry into the internal registry image stream](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-registryimagestream_registry).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_rhos"}]}

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload. Priority classes can help you control the Red Hat OpenShift controller decisions to favor higher priority pods over lower priority pods. The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs). Access policies and SCCs can help prevent untrusted users from deploying high priority pods that prevent other pods from scheduling.\n\nHow does priority scheduling and preemption work?\n\nIn general, pending pods that have a higher priority are scheduled before lower prioritized pods. If you don't have enough resources remaining in your worker nodes, the Red Hat OpenShift controller can preempt (remove) pods to free up enough resources for the higher prioritized pods to be scheduled. Preemption is also affected by graceful termination periods, pod disruption budgets, and worker node affinity.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-pod_priority"}]}

As such, app deployments that run in community Kubernetes clusters might need to be modified to run in Red Hat OpenShift.\n\n\n\n Customizing security context constraints \n\nTo create, edit, list, delete, and otherwise manage security context constraints, see the [Red Hat OpenShift docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html). You can also authorize users or groups to the default security context constraints by using role-based access control such as clusterroles, clusterrolebindings, roles, and rolebindings.

The oc version is the same as that of the cluster being managed.\n\nGuidelines for assigning access to SCCs:\n\n\n\n* Authorize specific service accounts to the SCC that is to be used by pods running under that service account.\n* If a service account needs access to multiple SCCs, consider creating additional service accounts so that all pods running under a service account are expected to use the same SCC.\n* Do not authorize all users or all service accounts to use any SCC other than the restricted (4.10 and earlier) or restricted-v2 (4.11 and later) SCCs.\n* Do not change SCC authorization for service accounts in the openshift- namespaces.

Access to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud resources can be controlled with context-based restrictions and identity and access management policies.\n\nThese restrictions work with traditional IAM policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Unlike IAM policies, context-based restrictions don't assign access. Context-based restrictions check that an access request comes from an allowed context that you configure. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials.

For more information about SCCs, see the [Red Hat OpenShift docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html).\n\nWhy do I set security context constraints?\n: As a cluster admin, you want to control what happens in your cluster, especially actions that affect the cluster's security or readiness. Security context constraints can help you control what actions and access the pods in your container have, such as the usage of privileged containers, root namespaces, host networking and ports, volume types, host file systems, Linux permissions such as read-only or group IDs, and more.\n\nCan I also add users or system groups to SCCs?\n: For user access to your cluster resources, don't use SCCs. Instead, see [Assigning cluster access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-users) to set IBM Cloud IAM and infrastructure permissions.\n: For system groups such as system:authenticated, these groups already are assigned to SCCs. You can see which groups are assigned to an SCC by describing the SCC.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

So vet your device list carefully to prevent unnecessary charges.\n\nYou can monitor your push usage by setting up a monitoring dashboard through the Actions menu in the Event Notifications dashboard. For more information, see [Monitor Event Notifications service metrics with IBM Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-monitoring).\n\n\n\n Push charges for pre-production destination \n\nThe IBM Cloud push service has two components to pricing: a destination instance fee and a consumption price.\n\nA pre-production destination instance fee is charged monthly. Every pre-production destination added to your Event Notifications instance incurs the fee.\n\nConsumption: Only 500 devices or 5000 outbound digital messages is permitted per pre-production destination. If either the number of devices or the number of outbound digital messages exceeds the permitted limit, the permitted number of devices is moved by additional 500 devices or by additional 5000 messages and charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-push"}]}

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries).

If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached.

When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage.

These entity types teach your assistant not only terms of interest, but also the context in which terms of interest typically appear in user utterances, enabling your assistant to recognize never-seen-before entity mentions based solely on how they are referenced in user input. For example, if you annotate the intent user example, I want a flight to Boston by labeling Boston as a @destination entity, then your assistant can recognize Chicago as a @destination mention in a user input that says, I want a flight to Chicago. This feature is currently available for English only. See [Adding contextual entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entitiesentities-create-annotation-based) for more information.\n\nWhen you access the tool with an Internet Explorer web browser, you cannot label entity mentions in intent user examples nor edit user example text.\n\nEntity recommendations\n: Watson can now recommend synonyms for your entity values. The recommender finds related synonyms based on contextual similarity extracted from a vast body of existing information, including large sources of written text, and uses natural language processing techniques to identify words similar to the existing synonyms in your entity value.

Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03354-4186-6431", "score": 20.414473163416456, "text": "\n[Open conversation panel that shows the original text for a term to which spelling correction logic was applied](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/open_convo_spellchecked.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n Improving across assistants \n\nCreating a dialog skill is an iterative process.

However, if you want a high-performance feed, you can use persistent connections and long-polling or similar techniques.\n\nSince Cloud Functions actions must be short-running, an action cannot maintain a persistent connection to a third party.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service.

When Vulnerability Advisor is queried, a scan result is retrieved that might be up to 5 days old. Scan results are deleted 30 days after they are generated.\n\nIn version 4, the image is indexed when it is first pushed to Container Registry registry, and that index report is stored in the database. When Vulnerability Advisor is queried, the image index report is retrieved, and a vulnerability assessment is produced. This action happens dynamically every time Vulnerability Advisor is queried. Therefore, no pregenerated scan result exists that requires deleting. However, the image index report is deleted within 30 days of the deletion of the image from the registry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Types of vulnerabilities \n\n\n\n Vulnerable packages \n\nVulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in images that are using supported operating systems and provides a link to any relevant security notices about the vulnerability.\n\nPackages that contain known vulnerability issues are displayed in the scan results.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_index&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07899-3004-4915", "score": 21.56302116349747, "text": "\nSI-2 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain verifies source code branch protection rules to enforce security policies<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes unit tests to validate all code changes<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes acceptance tests to validate every deployment<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain deployment has approved change documentation including security impact analysis<br><br><br> \n SI-2 (c) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain deployment has approved change documentation including security impact analysis<br><br><br>", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-si-2"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06845-2832-4521", "score": 21.22827508818404, "text": "\ncollect-evidence --tool-type \"sonarqube\" --evidence-type \"com.ibm.static_scan\" --asset-type \"repo\" --asset-key \"app-repo\" --status \"success\" --attachment ./sonarqube-result-1.json --attachment ./sonarqube-result-2.json --meta environment=staging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Supported tool formats \n\nThe current implementation currently supports the following tools (provided as the --tool-type parameter):\n\n\n\n* cra IBM Code Risk Analyzer\n* va Vulnerability Advisor for IBM Cloud Container Registry\n* gosec GoLang Security Scanner\n* xray JFrog Xray - Vulnerability Scanning & Container Security\n* owasp-zap OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)\n* owasp-zap-ui OWASP Zed Attack Proxy UI (ZAP UI)\n* sonarqube 'SonarQube scan\n\n\n\nIf the collect-evidence script is called with a tool type that is not supported, the script doesn't attempt to process the attachments.

In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running. You can develop and deploy Spark SQL, data transformation, data science, or machine learning jobs using the Spark application API.\n\n\n\n\n\n What are the advantages of IBM Analytics Engine serverless instances? \n\nWith IBM Analytics Engine serverless, compute and memory resources are allocated on demand when Spark workloads are deployed.

Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the instance, billed on a per second basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark support Hadoop? \n\nNo, currently, the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark only supports Apache Spark.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change the instance home storage of a serverless instance? \n\nNo, you can't. After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries. Changing instance home would result in the loss of the Spark history data and custom libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is user management and access control managed in a serverless instance? \n\nUser management and access control of an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance and its APIs is done through IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM). You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 27.56998170710024, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 24.03308739625832, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04170-1738-2974", "score": 22.866861271023176, "text": "\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 22.439874944564654, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 22.3383281176868, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Without service discovery, you will need to get the endpoint information of these peers out of band from other organizations and add them to your connection profile. For more information, see [Configuring anchor peers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-governibp-console-govern-channels-anchor-peers).\n\nLater in this topic, we use the connection profile to build a Fabric gateway that is configured for [service discovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-appibp-console-app-sd-cfg).\n\n\n\n\n\n Enrolling by using the SDK \n\nOnce the network operator provides the enroll ID and secret of the application identity and the network connection profile, an application developer can use the Fabric SDKs or the Fabric CA client to generate client-side certificates. You can use the following steps to enroll an application identity by using the [Fabric SDK for Node.js](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-2.2/index.html).\n\n\n\n1.

You created a simple conversation with two intents and a dialog to recognize them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps \n\nThis tutorial is built around a simple example. For a real application, you need to define some more interesting intents, some entities, and a more complex dialog that uses them both.

Your application needs to connect to the peers that need to endorse the transaction and needs to connect to the ordering service that will order the transaction and add it into a block. You can provide the endpoints of these nodes to your application by using your connection profile to construct a Fabric gateway. The gateway then conducts the low-level interactions with your Fabric network.

The uplift charge is a percentage (%) of the hourly rate (r), and is added to the hourly rate of the worker node. The total hourly rate cost for a worker node can be calculated as r + (r \u00d7 %). In the [Kubernetes cluster creation console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create), this uplift is reflected in the pricing calculator as you configure your cluster details.

You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database.

In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier. You must definitely avoid patterns that rely on updating the same document over and over in a small time window.\n\n\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Recurring dollar credit promotions use the following format: $X every Y months, repeats Z times.\n* Promo credit expires at the end of the committed term.

Any additional controls that are needed within a tenancy must be provisioned separately by using a gateway, security groups, or host-based controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Benefits of moving to VRF \n\nMoving to VRF includes the following primary benefits:\n\n\n\n* Industry-proven and widely accepted multiple isolation separation technologies. Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network.

Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ma-4"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02746-7-1681", "score": 17.923965821769407, "text": "\nDefining password policies \n\nPassword policies, such as strength requirements, help you to enforce more secure applications. By defining advanced policies, you can define the rules that a user must conform to when they set their password or attempt to sign in to your app. For example, you can set the number of times that a user can try to sign in before they are locked out of their account.\n\n\n\n Policy: password strength \n\nA strong password makes it difficult, or even improbable for someone to guess the password in either a manual or automated way. To set requirements for the strength of a user's password, you can use the following steps.\n\nTo set this configuration by using the GUI:\n\n\n\n1. Go to the Cloud Directory > Password policies tab of the App ID dashboard.\n2. In the Define password strength box, click Edit. A screen opens.\n3. Enter a valid regex string in the Password strength box.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n* Must be at least 8 characters. (^.{8,}$)\n* Must have one number, one lowercase letter, and one capital letter. (^(?:(?=.d)(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z]).)$)\n* Must have only English letters and numbers. (^[A-Za-z0-9]$)\n* Must have at least one unique character. (^(w)w?(?!1)w+$)\n\n\n\n4. Click Save.\n\n\n\nPassword strength can be set in the Cloud Directory settings page in the App ID dashboard, or by using [the management APIs](https://us-south.appid.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-ui//Management%20API%20-%20Config/mgmt.set_cloud_directory_password_regex).\n\n\n\n Setting a custom error message \n\nIf you set your own password regex policy and a user chooses a password that does not meet your requirements, the default message is The password doesn't meet the strength requirements.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-strength"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00708-54925-56282", "score": 17.771681692035198, "text": "\nrule-e76a3a81-b0d0-41fc-947d-13dc9cfff379 -

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

You can use the /dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the /dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

It finds information that is relevant to the query from the configured data sources and returns it so the assistant can share the information with the user as its response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Implementation \n\nThis diagram shows the implementation in more detail:\n\n![Flow diagram of the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/cp4d-diagram.png)\n\nHere's how you implement your assistant:\n\n\n\n1.

Use the intuitive graphical tool to define the training data and dialog for the conversation between your assistant and your customers.\n\nThe training data consists of the following artifacts:\n\n\n\n* Intents: Goals that you anticipate your users have when they interact with your assistant. Define one intent for each goal that can be identified in a user's input. For example, you might define an intent that is named store_hours that answers questions about store hours. For each intent, you add sample utterances that reflect the input customers might use to ask for the information they need, such as, What time do you open?\n\nOr use prebuilt content catalogs that are provided by IBM to get started with data that addresses common customer goals.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-index"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03037-8165-10458", "score": 32.807917543789145, "text": "\nEarly in the development process, use the Dialog skill analysis for Watson Assistant notebook to help you get started.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

Define a narrow set of key customer needs that you want the assistant to address on your behalf, including any business processes that it can initiate or complete for your customers. Start small.\n2. Create intents that represent the customer needs you identified in the previous step. For example, intents such as about_company or place_order.\n3. Build a dialog that detects the defined intents and addresses them, either with simple responses or with a dialog flow that collects more information first.\n4. Define any entities that are needed to more clearly understand the user's meaning.\n\nMine existing intent user examples for common entity value mentions. Using annotations to define entities captures not only the text of the entity value, but the context in which the entity value is typically used in a sentence.\n\nFor dictionary-based entities, use synonym recommendations to expand your entity definitions.\n5. Test each function that you add to the assistant in the \"Try it\" pane, incrementally, as you go.\n6. When you have a working assistant that can successfully handle key tasks, add an integration that deploys the assistant to a development environment. Test the deployed assistant and make refinements.\n7. After you build an effective assistant, take a snapshot of the dialog skill and save it as a version.\n\nSaving a version when you reach a development milestone gives you something you can go back to if subsequent changes you make to the skill decrease its effectiveness.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating intents \n\n\n\n1.

You can use the /dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the /dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03270-3352-5135", "score": 18.425391193105654, "text": "\nAdd a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step.

Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it. To ensure that a useful summary is provided to service desk agents when a conversation is transferred to them, add short dialog node names that reflect the node's purpose. For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.\n\n![Screen capture of the field in the node edit view where you add the node purpose summary.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/disambig-node-purpose.png)\n\nEvery dialog branch can be processed by the assistant while it chats with a customer, including branches with root nodes in folders.\n4.

Click Add response to add another response type to the current response.\n\nYou might want to add multiple response types to a single response to provide a richer answer to a user query. For example, if a user asks for store locations, you could show a map and display a button for each store location that the user can click to get address details. To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response. Meaning, if you define three conditional responses for a dialog node, each conditional response can have no more than 5 response types added to it.\n\nA single dialog node cannot have more than one Connect to human agent or more than one Search skill response.\n3.

The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources.

In any of these cases, you can [check the versions change log](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_versions) for any potential impact and choose to safely use the ibmcloud oc cluster master update[command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_cluster_update) yourself without waiting for the update automation to apply.\n\nUnlike the master, you must update your workers for each patch version.\n\nWhat happens during the master update?\n: Your master is highly available with three replica master pods. The master pods have a rolling update, during which only one pod is unavailable at a time. Two instances are up and running so that you can access and change the cluster during the update. Your worker nodes, apps, and resources continue to run.\n\nCan I roll back the update?\n: No, you can't roll back a cluster to a previous version after the update process takes place. Be sure to use a test cluster and follow the instructions to address potential issues before you update your production master.\n\nWhat process can I follow to update the master?\n: The following diagram shows the process that you can take to update your master.\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10189-1607-3670", "score": 15.34967433166968, "text": "\nThe status includes a timestamp of how long the master has been in the same state, such as Ready (1 month ago).

When specified in combination with PARTITIONED INTO, the same is done, which is often referred to as clustering the rows by the specified columns into the fixed number of partitions specified by PARTITIONED INTO. When specified without the PARTITIONED clause, it is equivalent to an ORDER BY clause specified at the top level of the SQL SELECT statement. If PARTITIONED INTO is specified, the ORDER BY clause is ignored.\n\n\n\n Partition by columns \n\nWhen you use the PARTITIONED BY (column-list) clause without specifying INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS, you can store the query result by using Hive-style partitioning, which is to create partitions that contain only rows that have certain values for one or more columns. Choose this physical layout if the stored object is further analyzed by using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.\n\nFor example, a result object that contains worldwide order data has a column country to represent the country that the order is initiated from. Partitioning the result object by the column PARTITIONED BY (country), would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.\n\nWhen the result object is stored this way on Cloud Object Storage, each SQL query that contains a predicate, such as country = 'USA' or country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY'), benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during SQL query execution partitions must be read only if they contain data for the countries of interest. This layout tremendously cuts down the I/O traffic of the SQL query.\n\nSee the following extra remarks on Hive-style partitioning.\n\n\n\n* Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme because the column names that are used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, /order/COUNTRY=USA/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet.\n* Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are stored in the object prefix of the partition.

The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

In Secrets Manager, the default TTL for root certificates is 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Choosing an algorithm for generating keys \n\nBefore you create a certificate authority in Secrets Manager, you must choose a key algorithm for generating the public and private keys for your CA. The public and private key-pair is used to authenticate an SSL/TLS connection. If you're not sure where to start, you can use the following suggested guide for selecting a key algorithm.\n\n\n\n1. Choose an algorithm family.\n\nThe key algorithm that you select determines the encryption algorithm and key size to use to generate keys and sign certificates. As a best practice, use the same algorithm family for all certificates that belong to a certificate chain. Secrets Manager supports the following families of algorithms.\n\n\n\nTable 2. Supported algorithm families and key sizes\n\n Algorithm family Description Supported key sizes \n\n RSA Widely used and compatible with most browsers and servers, RSA is the industry standard for public-key cryptography. 2048 bits <br>4096 bits \n Elliptic curve (EC) Generates stronger keys and smaller certificates.

Choose a key size.\n\nThe key size or length that you select determines the encryption strength. The larger the key size for an algorithm family, the more difficult it is to break. Keep in mind that longer key lengths results in more data to store and transmit, which can impact the performance of your certificate. As a best practice, choose a key size that is appropriate for the TTL or validity period of your certificate.\n\nFor longer living certificates, it is recommended to use longer key lengths to provide more encryption protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using certificate authority unauthenticated endpoints \n\nIf you're using leaf certificates that are issued by a CA in Secrets Manager for your applications, use the following API calls to gain access to the issuing CA Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and CA certificate.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-prepare-create-certificates"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04113-7-2190", "score": 12.794695049763792, "text": "\nBest practices for CIS setup \n\nBecause IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services is positioned at the edge of your network, you\u2019ll need to take a few steps to guarantee a smooth integration with your CIS services.

This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.  In the Query workspace page, enter the query and click Run on starter to get the results.\n2.  Click Explain on the screen to visualize the graphical representation of the query.\n\n\n\nOn the Explain window, click a stage to view the details on the right window.

Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance.

A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created.

However, data can repeat across objects.

This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

If a customer later searches for car, the passage that contains the vehicle mention is included in the search results.\n\nIf the field that you choose comes from a JSON file, after you apply the enrichment, the field data type is converted to an array. The field is converted to an array even if it contains a single value. For example, \"field1\": \"Discovery\" becomes \"field1\": [\"Discovery\"].\n\n\n\nYou can choose to apply resource-derived enrichments to your data later. Enrichments that you add to a project are available for use from any collection in the project. Go to the Manage collections page, choose the collection where you want to apply the enrichment, and then open the Enrichments tab. Make sure the status of the enrichment shows that it is Ready, and then apply the enrichment to a field in the collection. Enrichments that you enable are applied to the documents in random order.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it. To test whether your fixes address the issue, you can convert the original file to a PDF file to check for unexpected carriage returns in the text.\n\nAfter applying a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model to a PPT file, table boundaries are not recognized properly\n: During the conversion process, text that is extracted from the table is confused with text that is outside the table in some PPT pages.

Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted.

Critical data that changes more often might require more frequent backups than static data. Ask which data is most critical and which is to be archived.\n* Keep costs down by retaining backups for only while you need them to prevent data loss. Plan timely backups to restore data that might be deleted or corrupted. Think about the type of events that might happen. Ask how much data you can afford to lose. The answers can help you decide on a backup interval.\n* Ask how quickly you need to recover the data. Frequent backups that cover smaller incremental changes to your data afford quicker restoration. Run a test failover and volume restore to get an idea of the time it can take.\n* For best performance, stagger your backup jobs by creating backup plans with different intervals. You can have up to four different backup plans per backup policy.\n* For large volumes, consider a shorter retention period so that you don't exceed the 10 TB limit for all volume backups.\n* If you have volumes in different regions, create separate backup policies for each region. You're limited to 10 backup policies per account in a region.\n* Ensure that the volumes that you tagged for backups are attached to a virtual server instance. You can't back up detached volumes.\n* Provide a unique name for your backup policy. If you have a convention for naming volumes, you might name a backup policy by using a similar convention. Backups that are created by a policy can also follow the convention. As the number of backups grow, a good naming convention can make them more identifiable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practices for user actions \n\n\n\n* Organize tags that you apply to volumes and specify in backup policies. Ensure that multiple policies aren't using the same tags for target resources because that might trigger duplicate volume backups. You need only one tag to match to trigger a backup.\n* Determine what tags are already assigned to a volume from the list of Block Storage for VPC volumes.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16276-4355-6349", "score": 12.204350393008138, "text": "\nIf your action asks for the same type of data in more than one step, use the Always ask for this information setting to prevent the assistant from making incorrect assumptions.

However, you can add a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points your preferred DNS name to the auto-assigned load balancer DNS name. For example, your load balancer in us-south has ID dd754295-e9e0-4c9d-bf6c-58fbc59e5727, and the auto-assigned load balancer DNS name is dd754295-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud. Your preferred DNS name is www.myapp.com.

If the user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to still access their anonymous attributes by attaching their anonymous profile to their user identity with App ID.\n\n\n\n Understanding progressive authentication \n\nWhen a user chooses not to sign in immediately, they are considered an anonymous user. For example, say you're an online retailer and you want to allow users to add objects to their shopping cart without signing in. However, you ask them to sign in to complete their purchase. If a user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to access the same objects that were in their shopping carts before they signed in.\n\nYou can use App ID to gather information about anonymous users into an anonymous user profile, which you can use to help personalize their experience of your application. If the user chooses to signs in, you can attach the user attributes that are part of the anonymous profile to their user identity that is stored in App ID. Anonymous profiles are temporarily valid. While you develop your app, you can [configure the lifetime](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-managing-idpidp-token-lifetime) of anonymous tokens.\n\nWhen a user signs in, they become an identified user. If an existing identified user profile does not exist, you can create a new identified user profile. After a user is identified, App ID issues new access and identity tokens and their anonymous token becomes invalid. However, an identified user can still access the attributes of their anonymous profile because they are accessible with the new access and identity tokens.\n\nYou can attach the attributes of only one anonymous profile to the user's identity that is stored in App ID. For example, say that a user browses your application anonymously in two separate browser tabs. The user adds a t-shirt to the shopping cart on the first tab and a pair of shorts to the cart on the second tab.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step.

A change that affects a document almost certainly takes place at different times in different copies of the database.\n2. The order in which changes affect documents might differ between different copies of the database, depending on when and from where the replication took place.\n\n\n\nA consequence of the first characteristic is that, when you ask for a list of changes, it is meaningless to ask for a list of changes after a specific point in time. The reason is that the list of changes might be supplied by a different database copy, which resulted in document updates at different times. However, it is meaningful to ask for a list of changes after a specific change, which is specified by using a sequence identifier.\n\nAn extra consequence of the first characteristic is that it might be necessary to \"look back\" at preceding changes to agree on the list of changes. In other words, to get a list of changes, you start from the most recent change that the database copies agree on. The point of agreement between database copies is identified within IBM Cloudant by using the [checkpoint](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-guidecheckpoints) mechanism that enables replication between database copies to be synchronized.\n\nFinally, when you look at a list of changes, they might be presented in a different order in subsequent requests. The order depends on how documents were changed between different database copies. In other words, an initial list of changes might report changes A, B, then C in that order. But a subsequent list of changes might report changes C, A, then B in that order. All the changes are listed, but in a different order. This difference is because the sequence of changes that are received during replication might vary between two different copies of the database.\n\n\n\n What does \"eventual consistency\" mean for the list of changes? \n\nWhen you request a list of changes, the response you get might vary depending on which database copy supplies the list.\n\nThe since option obtains a list of changes after a specific update sequence identifier.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-guide"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12918-7-2258", "score": 14.032724442522046, "text": "\nPricing \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae is priced based on the provisioned throughput capacity that you allocate for your instance, and the amount of data storage consumed. With IBM Cloudant, you can scale your provisioned throughput capacity up and down, and pay a pro-rated hourly rate. The provisioned throughput capacity is a reserved number of reads per second, writes per second, and global queries per second allocated to an instance. The throughput capacity setting is the maximum usage level for a given second. You can't exceed the reserved capacity for either reads, writes, or global queries. If you do, an HTTP 429 status code occurs that indicates the application is trying to exceed its provisioned throughput capacity allowance. IBM Cloudant usage is billed hourly.\n\nThe estimated monthly cost for a particular level of provisioned throughput and storage capacity can be determined by using the Cost Estimator on the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant) for IBM Cloudant.\n\nYou can use the IBM Cloud pricing calculator to see estimated costs in other currencies by clicking Add to estimate from the IBM Cloudant catalog tile. Specify storage, capacity, and select the country whose currency you want to see.\n\nClick Calculate cost and Save. Now, click Review estimate. Expand the estimate to see more details. If you save multiple estimates, you can then click Review estimate and compare them.\n\nYou can launch the IBM Cloud Dashboard.

In this case, the IBM Cloudant team recommends that you start with the lowest provisioned throughput capacity and increase it as needed by your application's usage over time.

These locations are called availability zones. An availability zone is an IBM Cloud\u00ae Public location that hosts your data. All Lite and Standard plans automatically deploy into a multi-zone region. Dedicated Hardware plan instances can be deployed in most [IBM data center locations](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/data-centers/).\n\n\n\n\n\n  What is the difference between a single-zone and a multi-zone region? \n\nA multi-zone region includes three availability zones that can be used by an instance that is deployed to that region. The multi-zone regions available with IBM Cloudant include the following regions:\n\n\n\n*  Dallas\n*  Frankfurt\n*  London\n*  Osaka\n*  Sydney\n*  Tokyo\n*  Washington DC\n\n\n\nA single-zone region offers only one availability zone for that region.

If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03027-7-1946", "score": 24.0279182231382, "text": "\nSupported languages \n\nWatson Assistant supports individual features to varying degrees per language.\n\nWatson Assistant has classifier models that are designed specifically to support conversational skills in the following languages:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

You can verify if a cluster does or does not use a system channel by clicking the cluster's tile and looking near the Orderer Type text.\n\nJoining an orderer to an application channel will make it either a follower or a consenter. It will be a consenter if the node is found in the the channel's config block in the consenters section. Otherwise the orderer will be a follower. Both types of orderers will receive transaction/block data, but only a consenter can vote and play a role in the consensus algorithm. A node can be promoted from a follower to a consenter by first joining it to the channel, and then editing the channel's config to add it as a consenter. Similarly these steps can be reversed to demote an orderer and unjoin it completely if need be.\n\nJoining an orderer to the application channel can be started by clicking the cluster's tile.

If it is, you will not be able to delete the node until it has been removed as a consenter from all channels. After removing the node as a consenter from all channels, you will be able to delete the node by clicking the trash can icon.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15141-7808-9997", "score": 18.963873028115593, "text": "\nTransport layer protocols act as liaisons between the application layer protocols and the services that are provided by the network. Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel). When the traffic is split between the VPN interface and other interfaces, split tunneling is said to be in use.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-vpn-planning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04107-6095-8145", "score": 18.49081154236315, "text": "\nThis tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again.

In zone-based firewall operation an interface is assigned to a zone (only one zone per interface) and firewall rule sets are assigned to the boundaries between zones with the idea that all interfaces within a zone have the same security level and are allowed to route freely. Traffic is only scrutinized when it is passing from one zone to another. Zones drop any traffic coming into them which is not explicitly allowed.\n\nAn interface can either belong to a zone or have a per-interface firewall configuration; an interface cannot do both.\n\nImagine the following office scenario with three departments, each department with its own VLAN:\n\n\n\n* Department A - VLANs 10 and 20 (interface dp0bond1.10 and dp0bond1.20)\n* Department B - VLANs 30 and 40 (interface dp0bond1.30 and dp0bond1.40)\n* Department C - VLAN 50 (interface dp0bond1.50)\n\n\n\nA zone can be created for each department and the interfaces for that department can be added to the zone.

For the mentions, relations, or coreferences, select the Detailed Statistics link.\n4. In the Summary view, specify whether you want to evaluate test data or training data, and then specify the type of annotations you want to see statistics for: entity types, relation types, or coreferenced mentions. As you scroll through the data, items that have low scores are flagged and highlighted to indicate that they require investigation and improvement. The triangle warning icon indicates that the F1 value is less than the fixed value, 0.5.\n\nFor example, the F1 score for some entity types might be high because the document was annotated through pre-annotation as well as by a human annotator. But the F1 score for other entity types might be low because differences in phrasing, and differences in how human annotators interpret the text or annotation guidelines, make it more difficult for the machine learning model to recognize the pattern and apply the correct annotation.\n5.

For example, the default validation error message for a numeric value is I didn't catch that. Enter a number. You might want to customize this message to be more specific, such as Enter the number of people in your group.\n* If you want to use several validation responses, click Add Response to add more validation messages. The number of validation responses you can enter depends upon the value in the If attempts exceed field.\n* In the If attempts exceed field, click + or -, or directly edit the number, to change how many consecutive attempts the customer can make before the Fallback action is triggered.

The guidelines should be a living and changing document, especially at the beginning of the annotation process.

Be sure to include examples of difficult decisions and their preferred resolutions. The best way to determine what you need to add to the annotation guidelines is to carefully review document conflicts. Real examples of annotations that real people disagreed upon and how they were resolved can be a great help to human annotators as they tackle the annotation of new documents.\n* Update type system\n\nYou might need to update the type system for these reasons:\n\n\n\n* The documents that comprise the training data have references to concepts that are important types in the domain but are not represented anywhere in the type system. This suggests that you might need to add types that capture the missing concepts or relationships. Be careful not to try to define a type for every concept in a field, or every entity that occurs in domain documents; the type system should be limited to only the most fundamental types.\n* An existing type is being consistently misused by human annotators. If a type consistently causes confusion, then you might need to rename it or eliminate it if it is redundant.\n* An existing type is never used by human annotators because it is never referenced in the documents. If the type is unlikely to ever be used in literature from this domain, then remove it from the type system.\n* Two types are often interchanged when human annotators annotate documents. Consider whether the two types could be consolidated into one type that accurately represents the concept or relationship. For example, if the type system contains both PERSON and PEOPLE, which are often used interchangeably, it might be best to use one type named PERSONPEOPLE that covers both cases instead of two separate types.\n\n\n\nUse caution when you update the type system.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-evaluate-ml"}]}

The human annotator annotates the documents in the annotation set.

In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

That is how project managers know that they can start to evaluate the documents for inter-annotator agreement, reject or accept documents, and promote them to ground truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotating repeating mentions \n\nYou can optionally use the concordance tool to label multiple occurrences of a mention at once. The tool enables you to annotate the same text with the same entity type throughout a document and across annotation sets. Using the tool helps to ensure consistency in annotation across multiple documents. For example, you can label each occurrence of the mention encryption individually in mention mode, or you can label all occurrences of the mention encryption by using the concordance tool. Either way, the model learns from the entity type that you apply to the mention.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nAlthough the concordance tool is optional, a good practice is to use the concordance tool to annotate mentions within a document or across documents before you start annotating mentions in individual documents. When you apply an entity type to a mention with the concordance tool, the system applies the entity type to all matching mentions, overriding any existing entity types that are assigned to a matching mention. To avoid conflicts, attributes (such as roles or subtypes) are removed from existing entity types when a new entity type is applied by the concordance tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo annotate repeating mentions:\n\n\n\n1.

That is how project managers know that they can start to evaluate the documents for inter-annotator agreement, reject or accept documents, and promote them to ground truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotating repeating mentions \n\nYou can optionally use the concordance tool to label multiple occurrences of a mention at once. The tool enables you to annotate the same text with the same entity type throughout a document and across annotation sets. Using the tool helps to ensure consistency in annotation across multiple documents. For example, you can label each occurrence of the mention encryption individually in mention mode, or you can label all occurrences of the mention encryption by using the concordance tool. Either way, the model learns from the entity type that you apply to the mention.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nAlthough the concordance tool is optional, a good practice is to use the concordance tool to annotate mentions within a document or across documents before you start annotating mentions in individual documents. When you apply an entity type to a mention with the concordance tool, the system applies the entity type to all matching mentions, overriding any existing entity types that are assigned to a matching mention. To avoid conflicts, attributes (such as roles or subtypes) are removed from existing entity types when a new entity type is applied by the concordance tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\nTo annotate repeating mentions:\n\n\n\n1.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone.

Place control plane hosts into a separate network segment. Control plane hosts support various management and security-related components of the Satellite location. To facilitate effective network flow restrictions within the Satellite location, it is recommended to place control plane hosts into a separate network segment (whether physical or virtual) that can enable clear identification of source or destination of the network flows related to control plane functionality. The control plane hosts can be deployed to different physical locations, but the address space they are assigned to should provide an easy way to identify this group of hosts (for example, CIDR blocks).\n2. Designate a separate network segment for each group of Satellite hosts assigned to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud workload clusters. Satellite hosts that are assigned to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud workload clusters (workload hosts) should use their own network segments that would enable network flow control and monitoring between workload hosts, control plane, and other components outside of the Satellite location. It is recommended to designate a separate network segment (virtual subnet, VLAN, or a similar entity) for each group of Satellite hosts assigned to the same workload cluster.\n3.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-connectivity-management-isolation"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16030-4758-6868", "score": 15.683874973851204, "text": "\nInter-subnet, inter-zone data flows - For these flows, the implicit router function removes the VNI and forwards the packet in the VPC's MPLS VPN for transit across the cloud backbone. At the destination zone, the implicit router function tags the data packet with the appropriate VNI. Then, the packet is forwarded to the destination hypervisor, where the VNI is stripped off again so that the data packet can be forwarded to the destination virtual server instance.\n\nExtra-vpc service data flows - Packets that are destined for IaaS or IBM Cloud Service Endpoint (CSE) services use the VPC's implicit router function. They also use a network address translation (NAT) function. The translation function replaces the virtual server instance address with an IPv4 address that identifies the VPC to the IaaS or CSE service that is requested.\n\nExtra-vpc internet data flows - Packets that are destined for the internet are the most complex.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

Submit test utterances from the chat widget that is displayed on your web page to see how the assistant responds.\n\nNo responses are returned until after you create a dialog skill and add it to the assistant.\n\nIf the Connect to agent button is displayed and you don't have human agent support configured, you can hide it by changing the Suggestions configuration. For more information, see [Showing more suggestions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-alternate).\n\nIf you don't extend the session timeout setting for the assistant, the dialog flow for the current session is restarted after 60 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 60 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values.\n\n\n\nA developer can use APIs to apply more advanced customizations to the style of the web chat.

With IBM Cloud\u00ae App ID, you can configure one or several identity providers to create a custom sign-in experience for your users.\n\nApp ID interacts with identity providers by using various protocols such as OpenID Connect, SAML, and more. For example, OpenID Connect is the protocol that is used with many social providers such as Facebook, Google. Enterprise providers such as [Azure Active Directory](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-azure-active-directory) or [Active Directory Federation Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/setting-ibm-cloud-app-id-active-directory-federation-service), generally use SAML as their identity protocol. For [Cloud Directory](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), the service uses SCIM to verify identity information.\n\nWhen you use social or enterprise identity providers, App ID reads user account information. Because the service never has write access to the information, users must go through their chosen identity provider to do actions, such as resetting their password. For example, if a user signs in to your app with Facebook, and then wanted to change their password, they must go to www.facebook.com to do so.\n\nWhen you use [Cloud Directory](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-cloud-directory), App ID is the identity provider.

This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"></div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

Discovery v2 offers significant advantages over Discovery v1.\n\nLearn about how to migrate a v1 Discovery service instance to Discovery v2, including how to move data and update your applications.\n\nThe major structural differences between Discovery v1 and v2 include:\n\n\n\n* There is no concept of an environment in v2. The deployment details such as size and index capacity are managed for you when you choose the appropriate service plan for your needs. For managed deployments, you can choose a Plus, Enterprise, or Premium plan, for example. For installed deployments, the sizing is managed by the deployment type that you specify when you install the service in Cloud Pak for Data.\n* There is no single configuration object in v2. Control of the enrichments that are applied to documents is managed in the collections and project objects in v2. Other v1 configuration capabilities, such as the ability to customize the conversion step of ingestion, are not available in v2.\n* Greater programmatic support is available for custom enrichments in v2. New enrichment API methods are available that you can use to create enrichments. v2 also introduces document classifier API methods that you can use to train document classifier models programmatically. You can apply these custom enrichments to a collection by using the API.\n* The capabilities of a natural language query search are expanded in v2 to enable the return of the top passages per document and of succinct answers from passages. Other advanced search capabilities are introduced, including table retrieval. In v2, the deduplication parameter is not available and the continuous relevancy training and query logging functions are not available.\n* For more information about feature differences, see [the feature comparison table](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-version-chooseversion-choose-comparison).\n* For more information about detailed API differences, see [API version comparison](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-migrate-to-v2-api).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-migrate-to-v2"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16034-7-1778", "score": 16.815648009083905, "text": "\nVPC CLI release notes \n\nThe following release notes are for the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) command line interface (CLI).\n\n\n\n v6.15.0 \n\nVersion 6.15.0 was released on 2023-07-11.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* New commands image-obsolete and image-deprecate are introduced to support image lifecycle management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for image lifecycle management in image-create, image-update, and images commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.14.1 \n\nVersion 6.14.1 was released on 2023-06-30.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* Fixed issue with using the SSH key generated from UI in CLI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.14.0 \n\nVersion 6.14.0 was released on 2023-06-23.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for more algorithms in the SSH key key-create command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.13.0 \n\nVersion 6.13.0 was released on 2023-06-22.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for snapshot and backup cross region copy in snaphot-create, snapshots, backup-policy-plan-create and backup-policy-plan-update commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.12.0 \n\nVersion 6.12.0 was released on 2023-06-01.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands \n\n\n\n* Added support for fileshare mount targets in share commands (Beta).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Removed commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n\n* Fixed bare-metal-server-network-interfaces, bare-metal-server-profiles and bare-metal-servers commands to print correct response values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n v6.11.1 \n\nVersion 6.11.1 was released on 2023-05-03.\n\n\n\n New commands \n\n\n\n* N/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updated commands", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-cli-rn"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-142081-143984", "score": 16.687545585305028, "text": "\nFor example, the Overview page includes several new, detailed graphs that summarize interactions between users and your application, the amount of traffic for a given time period, and the intents and entities that were recognized most often in user conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12 March 2018 \n\nNew date and time methods\n: Methods were added that make it easier to perform date calculations from the dialog.

Terminology\n\n Heroku Code Engine Description \n\n N/A Resource group and projects A grouping of workloads. The specific choice of which workload goes into each grouping is defined by the user. \"Resource groups\" are an IBM Cloud concept, while \"projects\" are Code Engine specific.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16267-2886-4844", "score": 13.720640023872537, "text": "\n* Words containing special characters, such as hyphens (-), asterisks (*), ampersands (&), or at signs (@), including those used in email addresses or URLs.\n* Words that belong, meaning words that have implied significance because they occur in your action steps or dialog entity values, entity synonyms, or intent user examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n How is spelling autocorrection related to fuzzy matching? \n\nIn dialog, fuzzy matching helps your assistant recognize dictionary-based entity mentions in user input. It uses a dictionary lookup approach to match a word from the user input to an existing entity value or synonym in the skill's training data. For example, if the user enters boook, and your training data contains a @reading_material entity with a book value, then fuzzy matching recognizes that the two terms (boook and book) mean the same thing.\n\nIn dialog, when you enable both autocorrection and fuzzy matching, the fuzzy matching function runs before autocorrection is triggered. If it finds a term that it can match to an existing dictionary entity value or synonym, it adds the term to the list of words that belong to the skill, and does not correct it.\n\nFor example, if a user enters a sentence like I wnt to buy a boook, fuzzy matching recognizes that the term boook means the same thing as your entity value book, and adds it to the protected words list.

Each feature does its part to help your assistant understand the meaning of the user input.\n\n\n\n\n\n How autocorrection works \n\nNormally, user input is saved as-is in the text field of the input object of the message. If, and only if the user input is corrected in some way, a new field is created in the input object, called original_text. This field stores the user's original input that includes any misspelled words in it. And the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected. Set the condition for the dialog node or conditional response that is asking for confirmation to original_text. This means that if the user's input was automatically corrected, show the corresponding response. And the response can contain the expression: You said: <?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-spell-check"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13878-17352-18831", "score": 13.405818462101003, "text": "\n* Tutorial: [Apply end to end security to a cloud application](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-cloud-e2e-security)\n* Tutorial: [Best practices for organizing users, teams, applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-users-teams-applications)\n* Blog: [Cloud App Security: What Makes a Secure App?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/cloud-app-security)\n* Blog: [Onboarding Cloud Projects: Security and Resource Considerations](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/onboarding-cloud-projects-security-and-resource-considerations)\n* Blog: [Use Your FIDO2 Key for 2FA on IBM Cloud Apps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/use-your-fido2-key-for-2fa-on-ibm-cloud-apps)\n* Blog: [Going Passwordless on IBM Cloud Thanks to FIDO2](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/going-passwordless-on-ibm-cloud-thanks-to-fido2)\n* Blog: [IBM Cloud Security Hands-On: Share Your Chatbot Project](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/share-your-chatbot-project)\n* Blog: [Increase Information Security for Db2 on IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/increase-information-security-for-db2-on-ibm-cloud)\n* IBM Architecture Center: [Security to safeguard and monitor your cloud apps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/securityArchitecture)\n* [IBM Cloud platform service CLIs and APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-platform-svc-cli-api)\n* [IBM Cloud Compliance Programs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-extended-app-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02718-4890-5645", "score": 13.32562295454032, "text": "\nSo we've got maybe [Writing] app one here, [Writing] app two, and say a [Writing] web page.\n\nWith a feature flagging service we can actually group these in collections so that we're a little bit more organized with which feature flags are tied to, which apps are web pages.\n\nSo now today we've learned about returning feature flags on and off without deployment testing directly in production, and then segmenting those features based on the user attributes.\n\nThank you for watching.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-index"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16233-7-2298", "score": 35.79794306992702, "text": "\nAbout Watson Assistant \n\nUse IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant to build your own branded live chatbot into any device, application, or channel.

Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search integration with IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\nZoom\n\n![Flow diagram of the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/arch-detail.png)\n\nHow it works\n\nCustomers interact with the assistant through one or more of these channels:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07148-7-2060", "score": 35.1815584086072, "text": "\nUsing the COVID-19 kit \n\nThe COVID-19 kit is a special collection available in US instances of IBM Watson\u2122 Discovery.

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16356-7-2036", "score": 37.34783158341903, "text": "\nDetecting trigger words \n\nUse the Trigger word detected action to add words or phrases to two separate groups.

The parameters specify the service's sensitivity to non-speech events and to background noise. The parameters are independent: You can use them individually or together.\n\nSpeech activity detection is supported for most language models. For more information, see [Language model support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-inputdetection-support).\n\n\n\n How speech activity detection works \n\nSpeech activity detection consumes the input audio stream and determines which parts of the stream to pass for speech recognition. Speech recognition is adversely affected by background speech and noise, causing the service to transcribe the wrong words, to produce words where none are present, or to omit words that are part of the input audio. The speech activity detection feature can help ensure that only relevant audio is processed for speech recognition.\n\nYou can use the feature to control the following aspects of speech recognition:\n\n\n\n* Suppress background speech. Call-center data often contains cross-talk (\"overhearing\") from other agents. You can set a volume threshold below which such background speech is ignored.\n* Suppress background noise. Some audio, such as speech recorded in a factory, can contain a high level of background noise. You can set a threshold below which such background noise is ignored.\n* Suppress non-speech audio events. Background music and tone events, such as audio played to a client who is waiting on hold on a telephone line, can cause inaccurate recognition. Silence can also result in unnecessary recognition or transcription errors. You can set a threshold below which such events are ignored.\n\n\n\nBy default, speech activity detection is configured to provide optimal performance for the general case for each model. For specific cases, the default settings might not be optimal and can lead either to slow transcription or to word insertions and deletions. You are encouraged to experiment with different settings to determine which values work best for your audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n Speech detector sensitivity \n\nUse the speech_detector_sensitivity parameter to adjust the sensitivity of speech activity detection.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-192793-195089", "score": 21.961641982322654, "text": "\nThe name you specify is saved as a title attribute of the node in the workspace JSON file and the system uses a unique ID that is stored in the name attribute to reference the node.\n\n\n\n\n\n 23 August 2017 \n\nUpdates to Korean, Japanese, and Italian\n: Language support has been enhanced for Korean, Japanese, and Italian. Note that the Watson Assistant service learning models may have been updated as part of this enhancement, and when you retrain your model any changes will be applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 August 2017 \n\nAccent normalization\n: In a conversational setting, users may or may not use accents while interacting with the Watson Assistant service. As such, an update has been made to the algorithm so that accented and non-accented versions of words are treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever, for some languages like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word barri\u00f3, which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb barrer (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word barrio (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches.

In this case the letter \u00f1 is not simply an n with an accent; it is a unique, Spanish-specific letter.\n\nYou can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers will not use the appropriate accents, or misspell words (including, for example, putting a n instead of a \u00f1), or you can explicitly include them in the training examples.\n\nNote: Accent normalization is enabled for Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Czech.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"}]}

Please rephrase your question.\n>> I want to make an appointment.\nWhat day would you like to come in?\n>> Thursday\nI'm afraid I don't understand.

Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation.

Each word/translation pair in a model tells the service how to pronounce a word when it occurs in input text.\n\nYou can use custom models to create application-specific translations for unusual words for which the service's regular pronunciation rules might yield imperfect pronunciations. For example, your application might routinely encounter domain-specific terms, special terms with foreign origins, personal or geographic names, or abbreviations and acronyms.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

If the entity or variable does not have a number value, it is treated as having a null value (0) in a numeric comparison.\n\nFor example, you want to check whether a dollar value that a user specified in user input is less than 100. If you use the condition @price < 100, and the @price entity is null, then the condition is evaluated as true because 0 is less than 100, even though the price was never set. To prevent this type of inaccurate result, use a condition such as @price AND @price < 100. If @price has no value, then this condition correctly returns false.\n* Checking for intents with a specific intent name pattern: You can use a condition that looks for intents that match a pattern. For example, to find any detected intents with intent names that start with 'User_', you can use a syntax like this in the condition:\n\nintents[0].intent.startsWith(\"User_\")\n\nHowever, when you do so, all of the detected intents are considered, even those with a confidence lower than 0.2.

Multiple instances of App Configuration within a single environment are all considered separate application instances, as are individual App Configuration instances in multiple environments (such as test, development, staging, or production).\n\nA single instance of App Configuration can serve multiple environments, and in fact the service is designed to do so.\n\nActive Entity ID - An active entity ID is a unique identifier for each entity that interacts with the App Configuration service. For example, an entity might be an instance of an app that runs on a mobile device, a microservice that runs on the cloud, or a component of infrastructure that runs that microservice. For any entity to interact with App Configuration, it must provide a unique entity ID. This task is most easily accomplished by programming your app or microservice to send the Entity ID by using the App Configuration SDK.\n\nAPI Call - An API call is the invocation of the App Configuration through a programmable interface.\n\nExactly what constitutes an API call varies depending on the entity type (for example, a microservice or a mobile app). For server-side entities like microservices, when the state of a feature flag or property changes in the App Configuration, a websocket connection notifies the SDK in the microservice that a state change occurred. The microservice then calls back into the App Configuration to retrieve the update. This action is an API call.\n\nAn API call also occurs on startup to the retrieve the initial configuration state. For client-side entities like mobile apps, websockets are not used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-faqs-usage"}]}
