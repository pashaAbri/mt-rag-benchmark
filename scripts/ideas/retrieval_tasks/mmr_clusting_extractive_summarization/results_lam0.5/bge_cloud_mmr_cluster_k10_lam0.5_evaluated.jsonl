You can also add more metrics by creating custom metrics and adding integrations.\n\n\n\n Metrics and labels \n\nA metric is a quantitative measure that has one or more labels to define its characteristics.\n\nUse metrics to analyze statistically data that has numerical values.\n\nA metric is represented by time series. A time-series is a unique combination of a metric name and label key-value pairs. For example: website_failedRequest |region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'. A data-point is the value generated for a time-series at a given point in time.\n\nLabels are classified as infrastructure labels and metric descriptor labels. Each metric has a set of pre-defined labels. For custom metrics, you can configure more labels.\n\nYou can use labels to identify and differentiate characteristics of a metric, for example,\n\n\n\n* You can group infrastructure objects into logical hierarchies.\n* You can filter out data.\n* You can split aggregated data into segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Collecting default metrics by using the Monitoring agent \n\nWhen you configure a Monitoring agent, data for default metrics is automatically collected. These metrics include metadata that you can use to label, segment, and display metrics when you monitor them. You do not need additional instrumentation or configuration in your hosts to obtain metrics that are collected automatically by the agent to gain insight into what is happening in them.\n\nTo monitor your infrastructure, network, and applications with the IBM Cloud\u00ae Monitoring service, you can deploy Monitoring agents on supported hosts. The host determines the agent type that you can deploy.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test? That works on every other database that you ever used, correct?\n\nNot on IBM Cloudant.\n\nOr rather, it works 99 times out of 100.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-in-practice"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05032-7-2136","score":0.6829509735,"text":"\nUsing Immutable Object Storage to protect buckets \n\nImmutable Object Storage preserves electronic records and maintains data integrity.

Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When you place an object in the bucket, a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the time of the object write.\n\nIf your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and Retain Until Date, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.\n\nLike all other Object Lock settings, the Retain Until Date applies to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.\n\nImagine an object that is 60 days into a 90-day retention period, and you overwrite that object with the same name and a two year retention period. The operation will succeed and a new version of the object with a two year retention period is created.

You can supplement local storage or SAN with other storage products as needed.\n\n\n\n Local storage \n\nLocal storage is built on disks that are local to the virtual server host. Local storage provides improved disk read and write performance. The disks are built in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) configuration for redundancy, disk replacement, and health monitoring that is fully managed by IBM Cloud\u00ae. In newer data centers, this storage is all solid-state drive (SSD) to provide the best performance. For more information about available data centers for local SSD storage, see [Balanced local storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-about-virtual-server-profilesbalanced-local-storage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Portable SAN storage \n\nPortable storage volumes are auxiliary storage solutions that are exclusively available on Virtual Servers. The portable SAN is built on IBM Cloud's all flash storage clusters rather than the local host storage. This infrastructure provides greater resiliency if a host fails and can also support much larger volumes. If a host fails, virtual server instances that use SAN-based storage are automatically migrated to other hosts and restarted.\n\nPortable storage is an ideal solution if you want to transfer data between virtual servers that exist in any data center on IBM Cloud's network. Portable storage volumes are useful for database applications that require access to raw, unformatted block-level storage and for moving large data sets between Virtual Servers.\n\n\n\n Portable SAN storage considerations \n\n\n\n* All secondary disks are attached as portable storage. In most cases, these secondary disks can be detached at any time to allow them to be moved to other virtual servers.\n* If public virtual servers use balanced local storage, you can't detach primary or secondary disks.\n* You can attach the disks to another server if the change doesn't exceed the disk quota or the maximum volume size limit of the targeted virtual server.\n* Moved disks are converted to the storage type of the target server.\n* When a portable storage volume is attached to a virtual server in a different data center than the original virtual server, IBM Cloud copies the volume to the SAN in the new data center.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-storage-options"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08127-5015-6275","score":0.6700642705,"text":"\nThis storage is limited availability and is available only in certain regions.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04869-7924-8861","score":0.7242043018,"text":"\nYou can manage your keys manually by supplying your own encryption keys - referred to as Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).\n\n\n\n\n\n Archive rules \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage Archive is a low-cost option for data that is rarely accessed.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02932-6045-6990","score":0.7476869226,"text":"\nAnd the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected.

If you specify true for this option, the returned skill context includes an encoded state property that represents the current conversation state.\n\nIf you are using the stateful message API, the service stores conversation state data only for the life of the session. However, if you save this context data (including state) and send it back to the service with a subsequent message request, you can restore the conversation to the same state, even if the original session expired or was deleted.\n\nIf you are using the stateless message API, the state property is always included in responses (along with the rest of context).

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13075-1823-3835","score":0.6782753468,"text":"\nFor more about the Discovery Query Language, see [Query concepts](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-concepts).\n\nAll private collections return a confidence score in the query results in most cases.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search.

Aggregations - Aggregations are a more complex query type, with nested aggregations having the highest impact on performance.\n3. Operators - Wldcarding and fuzzy matching can impact performance.\n4. Counts - Reducing the count of documents returned can improve performance; if you need to page through results, use the offset parameter.\n5. Return fields - Limiting the fields returned to only those needed for your application can help (For example, don\u2019t return the full text of the document if only the title and passage are needed.)\n\n\n\nSee [Query reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-reference) for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n Features used \n\nThere are a number of features that enhance query results. The following features can impact performance:\n\n\n\n1. Passage Retrieval - Passage retrieval searches within documents to find relevant snippets of text for your query. Use the passages.fields parameter to adjust which fields in the documents that passage retrieval searches. The parameter can help reduce the latency of passage retrieval when your content has many fields. For more information about passage retrieval, see [Passages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parameterspassages).\n2. Relevancy Training - Relevancy training computes features for each top-level text field (fields at the same level as document_id in the JSON) in the collection. If there are many top level fields, this can cause a performance impact for a natural_language_query when using training. Reducing the number of top level fields can improve performance. This can be done via normalization or by manually editing the JSON to put fields that are not helpful to finding relevant content in a nested structure.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00460-34449-36370","score":0.7809543014,"text":"\nQuery (_find endpoint) improved\n: IBM Cloudant Query now uses a new method to select an index.

Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to \/$DATABASE\/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body.

As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06063-53153-55320","score":0.6898739934,"text":"\nImage Vulnerability Scanner: By default, Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities.

The same package can list multiple vulnerabilities, and in this case, a single package update can address multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability Advisor returns vulnerabilities only when a package fix is published by the distributor. Declared vulnerabilities that aren't fixed yet, or are not going to be fixed, are not reported by Vulnerability Advisor.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06847-7-2266","score":0.6995026469,"text":"\nConfiguring detect-secrets scan \n\nDetect-secrets is a client-side security tool that detects secrets within a codebase to remediate and prevent secret leaks.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM\/detect-secrets](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/detect-secrets).\n\nDetect-secrets scans the entire current codebase and outputs a snapshot of currently identified secrets.

Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry. Then, [install the open source Portieris project](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) admission controller to block container deployments from unsigned images.\n3. Regularly scan running containers:. Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Depending on the app, to add extra security, you can establish a job that takes down vulnerable containers after they are detected.\n\n\n\nYou can use the built-in container registry to automate the container image build process from your source code in an external source repository to your internal registry. However, images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the internal registry. To set up image scanning, set up a registry namespace and push your images to the managed IBM Cloud Container Registry instead.\n\nZoom\n\n!","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-365807-367808","score":0.7146092653,"text":"\nThe images that are not eligible are still displayed, but they do not count toward the total number of images that is set in the retention policy and are not removed.\n* What regions are available?\n\n What regions are available? \n\nTo find out about the regions that are available for IBM Cloud Container Registry, see [Regions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_regions).\n* How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost?\n\n How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost? \n\nThe cost of Vulnerability Advisor is built into the pricing for IBM Cloud Container Registry.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Container Registry benefits\n\n Benefit Description \n\n Highly available and scalable private registry.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07949-12261-14447","score":0.8231058717,"text":"\nCombined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Container Registry \n\nUse [Container Registry](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview) to store and access private container images.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects.

You can use Container Registry by setting up your own imagenamespaceand pushing container images to your namespace.\n\nZoom\n\n![Diagram showing how you can interact with IBM Cloud Container Registry.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/cbb80bf851fb762a838129cba09d5674f8bfffda\/Registry\/images\/about_container_registry_v2.svg)\n\nFigure 1. How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

With simple steps to define configuration properties and use automated deployment, you can build your own HPC cluster in minutes. In addition, the automation deploys an extra virtual server instance (shown as the Login Node in the architecture diagram) so you can easily build and assemble applications for your cluster right away.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift for HPC enables three interfaces: UI, API, and CLI. The UI involves use of IBM Cloud Schematics workspaces. To use the API and CLI interfaces, the Terraform-based automation code is available in this [public GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Cloud\/hpc-cluster-openshift).\n\nThe offering enables the initial Red Hat OpenShift for HPC cluster creation.

If your entry point is not main, a custom name can be specified when the action is created, so take note of that name.\n* Input parameters into your app and output results from your app must be formatted into a specific structure that can be passed between entities. The structure depends on your code language. For example, with Python apps, the input parameters must be a dictionary and the result of your app must be structured as a dictionary. Because you can also pass parameters in a structured object to your action. In JSON, for example, you might structure your code to expect an input parameter with JSON values from certain fields, like name and place.\n\nJSON input example\n\n{\"name\": \"Dorothy\", \"place\": \"Kansas\"}\n\nJavaScript example\n\nfunction main(params) {\nreturn {payload: 'Hello, ' + params.person.name + ' from ' + params.person.place};\n}\n* If your app contains multiple files, they must be combined into one single file to be used in an action. You can either rewrite your code into one file or you can package the files and dependencies into a single archive file.

Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdk"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10817-2884-4620","score":0.6813215613,"text":"\nInstall mobile SDK from source code \n\n\n\n1.

Recently, you might have heard about Heroku changing their policy on free - the free tier. It's causing a challenge for a lot of developers out there so I want to take a handful of moments here to show you how you can migrate from Heroku to Code Engine from IBM Cloud in just a handful of steps. So let's go ahead and start playing around with it and see how quickly you can actually make your system work.\n\nSo first thing first, if you haven't seen it this is the actual line inside the official blog from Heroku, starting on November 28, 2022, we plan to stop free - offering the free product plans and plan on shutting down the free dynos and data services. We'll be sending out a series of email communications to affected users. This is challenging for a lot of beginner beginner web applications. I know for a fact personally I used Heroku when I first started back in the day so this is a pretty large hit for a lot of people and I want to show you how easy it is to convert from Heroku to Code Engine.\n\nSo first thing first, let's actually see a nice little application I've created. If I go ahead and bring up my application here, we have a nice little flask app. If you don't know what python is or flask is, it's a it's a format for python to be able to run an application on a standard port. So let's say we have this application; it says \u201cHello World!\u201d. I've already deployed it and we can check out right here We have our amazing production app at heroku.com. It says \u201chello world\u201d and we want to go ahead and change it. We wanted to update it so I'm going to go ahead and quickly update it to \u201cHello Moving from Heroku to Code Engine\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and come out of it. git add .git commit -m \u201cupdate hello line\u201d.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-heroku-migrate"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10852-32393-33557","score":0.6545256972,"text":"\n* [Packaging Ruby code](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_ruby_pkg)\n\n\n\n* [Preparing PHP apps](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_php)\n\n\n\n* [Structuring PHP code](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_php_struct)\n* [Packaging PHP code](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_php_pkg)\n* [Packaging Composer modules](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_php_composer)\n\n\n\n* [Preparing Java apps](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_java)\n\n\n\n* [Structuring Java code](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_java_struct)\n* [Packaging Java code](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_java_pkg)\n* [Packaging Java code with Gradle](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_java_gradle)\n* [Packaging Java code by using the Java runtime with Docker](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_java_docker)\n* [Packaging Java code with Maven inside Docker](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-prepprep_java_maven_docker)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-sitemap"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05362-6440-7931","score":0.6543774605,"text":"\nFor example, copy the following code example into a file called main.js.\n\nfunction main(args) {\nconst oneLinerJoke = require('one-liner-joke');\nlet getRandomJoke = oneLinerJoke.getRandomJoke();\n\nreturn {\nheaders: { 'Content-Type': 'text\/plain;charset=utf-8' },\nbody: getRandomJoke\n}\n}\n\nmodule.exports.main = main;\n2.

A sequence is a chain of actions, invoked in order, where the output of one action is passed as input to the next action.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-276996-279076","score":0.7307511568,"text":"\nSatellite Infrastructure Service is IBM-operated and as such, is covered in the IBM Cloud Satellite cloud service terms with additional information outlined in the [IBM Cloud Additional Services Description](http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/customer\/csol\/terms\/?id=i126-8979).\n* What compliance standards does the service meet?\n\nIBM Cloud is built by following many data, finance, health, insurance, privacy, security, technology, and other international compliance standards.

However, mobile developers usually don\u2019t have experience in managing server-side logic, and would rather focus on the app that is running on the device. This development goal is easily obtained by using Cloud Functions as the server-side back end, and is a good solution. In addition, the built-in support for server-side Swift allows developers to reuse their existing iOS programming skills. Since mobile applications often have unpredictable load patterns, you want to use a Cloud Functions solution like IBM Cloud\u00ae. This solution can scale to meet practically any demand in workload without the need to provision resources ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data processing \n\nWith the amount of data now available, application development requires the ability to process new data, and potentially react to it. This requirement includes processing both structured database records as well as unstructured documents, images, or videos. Cloud Functions can be configured by system-provided or custom feeds to react to changes in data, and automatically execute actions on the incoming feeds of data. Actions can be programmed to process changes, transform data formats, send and receive messages, invoke other actions, and update various data stores. Supported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04665-7-1913","score":0.7301459312,"text":"\nHow Cloud Foundry works with IBM Cloud \n\nIBM\u00ae Cloud Foundry is deprecated and no longer supported as of 1 June 2023.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant.

We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12463-30147-31055","score":0.6560973525,"text":"\n: With IBM Cloud Secrets Manager, you can create secrets dynamically and lease them to applications while you control access from a single location.

They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done. What it needs, in the form of the secret here, is what we call \"DB configs.\" Again, this DB config is going to allow it to have the correct communication with the service by saying, this is who I am and this is what I came here to accomplish.\n\nBut now that we have our user credentials in our DB configs as examples of secrets, we realize the vulnerability that can be created here if these credentials were to fall into the wrong hands. And this is why it's so important to establish a centralized place to manage all these things as we build out more applications and microservices. As we have more of these, the problem becomes more complex. If it falls into the wrong hands, how is protected? How do we block it from getting to that point?

A service credential is a collection of important information that is needed to connect to an instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage.

Given this common terminology, you can create dictionaries to help you categorize and filter the data. The keywords from the example might lead you to create the following dictionaries:\n\n\n\n* component dictionary for terms such as engine and brake\n* phenomenon dictionary for terms such as fire, smoke, and spark\n\n\n\nWhen you apply the dictionary enrichment to your data, it generates annotations. You can think of annotations as tags that you add to words or phrases, where the tag categorizes or identifies the meaning of the word or phrase. The resulting annotations function as new facets that you can use to filter and dissect your data further.\n\nWith your new component and phenomenon facets, for example, you can look for correlations between components and phenomena that are involved in traffic incidents.\n\n[Learn about the ways that you can analyze your data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-cm-analyze-data).\n\n\n\n\n\n Digging deeper \n\nTo dig even deeper into your data, apply or create AI models that can find different types of information in your documents.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS.

Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.7063522935,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.696402669,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.6927475929,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04175-0-1274","score":0.7018718123,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.6546264887,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service.

Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb\/vpc\/images\/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12170-1498-3591","score":0.7203510404,"text":"\nVPC VPC provides you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud. \n zones You must have one VPC subnet for each zone in your cluster.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template. Review available service plans and pricing information for each resource that you are about to create.

You can configure each image differently for its partition sizes.\n\nBare Metal Servers for VPC supports only UEFI images.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work? \n\nYou are billed for Bare Metal Servers for VPC based on the server profile that you selected. Billing stops only when you delete the bare metal server. Powering off the server doesn't change billing. For more information about billing and pricing, contact your IBM Sales representative.\n\nYou are also billed for other VPC services and resources that are attached to any bare metal servers. For more information about pricing for Bare Metal Servers on VPC, see [Pricing](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/vpc\/pricing).\n\n\n\n\n\n How is billing for bare metal severs different from virtual server instances? \n\nThe main difference between virtual server instances and the bare metal servers is that powering off a bare metal server has no effect on the billing cycle. Meaning that hourly billed servers still accrue at the normal rate whether the server is powered off or on. The billing stops only when the bare metal server is deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I view my invoices? \n\nTo view your account invoices, follow these steps.\n\n\n\n1.

Cost for backups is calculated based on GB capacity that is stored per month, unless the duration is less than one month. The backup exists on the account until it reaches its retention period, or when you delete it manually, or when you reach the end of a billing cycle, whichever comes first.\n\nPricing of subsequent backups can also increase or decrease when you [increase source volume capacity](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-expanding-block-storage-volumes) or [adjust IOPS](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-volume-iops) by specifying a different IOPS profile for the source volume. For example, expanding volume capacity increases costs. However, changing an IOPS profile from a 5-IOPS\/GB tier to a 3-IOPS\/GB tier decreases the monthly and hourly rate. Billing for an updated volume is automatically updated to add the prorated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle. The new full amount is then billed in the next billing cycle.\n\nPricing for backups is also set by region of the source volume.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14708-5356-6236","score":0.6742979884,"text":"\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match. A third party cannot use the hash without a copy of the original data.\n\nIt is important to be aware with this option that while Orgs A and B cannot see the actual ledger data because it is hashed, they are still able to see that Orgs C and D are transacting and can see the volume of transactions that are occurring between them.\n\nAlso, consider that data inside a private data collection can be purged from the peers that store it. While data is stored on a channel forever, collections allow members to specify how many blocks are committed to a channel before the [private data is purged](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.2\/private_data_tutorial.htmlpd-purge). Once data is removed from the private data collection, the hash on the channel can no longer be used to verify the transaction that created it.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers. The row headers identify features. The column headers identify the different skill types. To understand which features are supported by a skill, go to the row that describes the feature, and find the columns for the skill you are interested in.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-comparing-actions-dialog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02718-1684-3722","score":0.6103031635,"text":"\n[Writing] There's a couple benefits to using a feature flag service.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.

The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_11857-1988-2975","score":0.8588360548,"text":"\nSatellite-enabled IBM Cloud services \n\nEach IBM Cloud service instance that you create in your Satellite location incurs charges.

If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

One contract is for 10 worker nodes across 3 years. The other contract is for 5 worker nodes across 1 year. Therefore, the total capacity of the reservation is 15 worker nodes.\n\nClusters: Each cluster is in the same multizone region as the reservation, but can be in a different resource group. Reserved worker nodes from different reservations can be used in different clusters. A cluster can have a mix of reserved and regular, as-needed worker pools.\n\nWorker pools: You can create multiple worker pools in multiple clusters with your reserved worker nodes. Reserved worker nodes are used for the entire worker pool; you can't mix and match between regular and reserved worker nodes in the same worker pool. Reserved worker nodes are used on a first-available basis, which means if you provision a worker pool that uses all your reserved worker nodes, you have no more reserved worker nodes remaining for other worker pools. Therefore, you might create separate reservations for each team that owns a worker pool or cluster.\n\nZones: Because the reservation is created in an IBM Cloud multizone region, the reserved worker nodes can be used for clusters in any of the zones. For example, reservations in Washington, DC (US East region) can be used to create classic worker nodes in wdc04, wdc06, or wdc07.\n\nReserved worker nodes that are used in the worker pools: In this scenario, the development and production environments share a reservation that has a mix of contracts that are used for a mix of worker pools and teams. The reservation still has one unused, 3-year term reserved worker node that can be used for other worker pools or to scale up the existing worker pools. If the production environment needs more than one more worker node, you might resize down some worker pools in development, create a worker pool that uses on demand worker nodes, or add more contracts to the reservation. If you are concerned about a development environment using up your production environment resources, consider creating separate reservations for the different environments.\n\n\n\n Reservation usage and lifecycle \n\nHow can I use my reservation?\n: You can use your reservation to create worker pools in new or existing clusters.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-reservations"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6508205186,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6508205186}}

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1068047-1069909","score":0.6620926857,"text":"\nIf you manage your invoices through the IBM Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking Manage > Billing and usage, and selecting Invoices.

When you are confident on the feature that you want to roll out is working as intended, increase the percentage over time.\n\nPercentage rollout uses a hashing algorithm that generates a hash based on the rule set. This hash is used by the SDK to generate a percentage value for that user. The percentage value generated for that user is compared to the value set for the percentage rollout value, determines whether the user is eligible to receive that feature or not.\n\nFor example, the hash has partitions from 1 to 100,000. When you assign a feature flag, the hash assigns values from 1 to 100,000 to users in each partition. For example, when you assign 25% to a feature flag, App Configuration SDK delivers that feature to hash partitions from 1 to 25,000. If you change the percentage of users receiving that feature from 25% to 50%, partitions 25,001 to 50,000 would be added to the set of partitions already receiving that feature.\n\nPercentage rollout capability is available for Lite and Enterprise plans.\n\nFollowing are some of the percentage rollout scenarios:\n\n\n\n* If the feature flag is disabled, then SDK returns the default Disabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rules and no percentage rollout is set, then the SDK returns default Enabled value.\n* If the feature flag is enabled without any segment rule and percentage rollout is set to 0%, then the SDK returns Disabled value for all users.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-feature-flags"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02680-9660-11121","score":0.6533475518,"text":"\n@Override\npublic void onConfigurationUpdate() {\n\/\/ ADD YOUR CODE\n}\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples for using property and feature-related APIs for Android apps written in Java \n\nRefer to the examples for using the property and feature-related APIs.\n\n\n\n* Get single feature\n\nFeature feature = appConfiguration.getFeature(\"featureId\");\n* Get all features\n\nHashMap<String,Feature> features = appConfiguration.getFeatures();\n* Feature evaluation\n\nYou can use the feature.getCurrentValue() method to evaluate the value of the feature flag.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

When you add a dialog skill to an assistant and deploy it, the assistant saves the context from one message call and then re-submits it on the next request throughout the current session. The current session lasts for as long a user interacts with the assistant plus the designated session inactivity time frame. The maximum session inactivity time allowed ranges from 5 minutes to 7 days, depending on your plan type. If you do not add the dialog skill to an assistant, it is your responsibility as the custom application developer to maintain any continuing information that the application needs.\n\nThe application can pass information to the dialog, and the dialog can update this information and pass it back to the application, or to a subsequent node. The dialog does so by using context variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Context variables \n\nA context variable is a variable that you define in a node. You can specify a default value for it. Other nodes, application logic, or user input can subsequently set or change the value of the context variable.\n\nYou can condition against context variable values by referencing a context variable from a dialog node condition to determine whether to execute a node.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.

You can use a Jump to action to route the flow to a common dialog node from multiple locations in the tree, for example.\n\nThe target node that you want to jump to must exist before you can configure the jump to action to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the Jump to action \n\nIf you choose to jump to another node, specify when the target node is processed by choosing one of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If the statement targets the condition section of the selected dialog node, your assistant checks first whether the condition of the targeted node evaluates to true.\n\n\n\n* If the condition evaluates to true, the system processes the target node immediately.\n* If the condition does not evaluate to true, the system moves to the next sibling node of the target node to evaluate its condition, and repeats this process until it finds a dialog node with a condition that evaluates to true.\n* If the system processes all the siblings and none of the conditions evaluate to true, the basic fallback strategy is used, and the dialog evaluates the nodes at the base level of the dialog tree.\n\n\n\nTargeting the condition is useful for chaining the conditions of dialog nodes. For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.7076066732,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value. And when you add the mention to an existing entity value, it is also added to that entity value as new synonym. Intent classification does use these types of dictionary references in intent user examples to establish a weak reference between an intent and an entity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03282-4605-6541","score":0.6966092587,"text":"\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks.

However, there might be times when a user is in the middle of providing reservation details, but decides to not go through with placing the reservation. You must give users a way to exit the process gracefully.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial-slots-complex"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03406-21013-22808","score":0.7143006325,"text":"\nMove on \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you add more slots later, you must edit these conditions to account for the associated context variables for the additional slots.

You must do so because the node with slots only prompts users for information that it considers to be missing. If the slot context variables are all filled with valid values, no prompts are displayed. The same is true for the dialog at run time. You must build into the dialog a mechanism by which you reset the slot context variables to null so that the slots can be filled anew by the next user.

You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03126-5596-6966","score":0.715515852,"text":"\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.

It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized.

If a condition is specified, your assistant first evaluates the folder condition to determine whether to process the nodes within it.\n* Customizations: Any configuration settings that you apply to the folder are inherited by the nodes in the folder. If you change the digression settings of the folder, for example, the changes are inherited by all the nodes in the folder.\n* Tree hierarchy: Nodes in a folder are treated as root or child nodes based on whether the folder is added to the dialog tree at the root or child level. Any root level nodes that you add to a root level folder continue to function as root nodes; they do not become child nodes of the folder, for example. However, if you move a root level node into a folder that is a child of another node, then the root node becomes a child of that other node.\n\n\n\nFolders have no impact on the order in which nodes are evaluated. Nodes continue to be processed from first to last. As your assistant travels down the tree, when it encounters a folder, if the folder has no condition or its condition is true, it immediately processes the first node in the folder, and continues down the tree in order from there. If a folder does not have a folder condition, then the folder is transparent to your assistant, and each node in the folder is treated like any other individual node in the tree.\n\n\n\n Adding a folder \n\nTo add a folder to a dialog tree, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-tasks"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02953-12940-14393","score":0.7400674224,"text":"\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\nYou can see the number of dialog nodes in a dialog skill from the assistant tile.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers. The row headers identify features. The column headers identify the different skill types. To understand which features are supported by a skill, go to the row that describes the feature, and find the columns for the skill you are interested in.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-comparing-actions-dialog"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03006-6429-8032","score":0.7057596445,"text":"\nAdd the skills to your assistant.\n5.

When the node is processed, your assistant retrieves a passage from an external data source and returns it as the response to a particular question. This type of search occurs only when the individual dialog node is processed.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-1160-2754","score":0.7192420363,"text":"\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/depmodels\/cloud\/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/training\/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/35-Connectivity.svg)](https:\/\/community.ibm.com\/community\/user\/publiccloud\/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06501-7-1686","score":0.7148670554,"text":"\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it\u2019s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice. Verify that it succeeded before you store the token or URL to the attachment in the IBM Cloudant document.\n\nYour databases are smaller, cheaper, faster, and easier to replicate. For more information, see the following websites:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant docs on [attachments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments)\n* Detaching IBM Cloudant attachments to [Object Storage](https:\/\/medium.com\/codait\/detaching-cloudant-attachments-to-object-storage-with-serverless-functions-99b8c3c77925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fewer databases are better than many \n\nIf you can, limit the number of databases per IBM Cloudant account to 500 or fewer. While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run. As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00576-8941-10714","score":0.7626398206,"text":"\nThe maximum document size is 1 MB, but documents must be much smaller than that size, typically a few KB.\n\nFor more information, see the following blog posts:\n\n\n\n* [Optimal IBM Cloudant Indexing](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/05\/10\/Optimal-Cloudant-Indexing.html)\n* [Time-series Data Storage](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/04\/08\/Time-series-data-storage.html)\n* [Partitioned databases - data design](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/03\/05\/Partition-Databases-Data-Design.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Making the most of the primary index \n\nIBM Cloudant has a primary index on the document's _id attribute. This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00460-20076-21717","score":0.7528258562,"text":"\n: This build introduces a new feature, [partition query](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioningdatabase-partitioning).\n\nlimit\n: Allow limit when you use POST for search.\n\nView requests\n: Previously, view requests that use a limit parameter greater than 268435456 would have the limit that is silently reduced to 268435456.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03411-4781-6488","score":0.6645882726,"text":"\nTo achieve the same goal, you can use a saved version as the basis for a new version in which you incorporate any changes you want to make.

For more information about the new system entities, see [System entities](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities).\n\n\n\n\n\n 28 October 2020 \n\nIntroducing the actions skill!\n: The actions skill is the latest step in the continuing evolution of Watson Assistant as a software as a service application. The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nThe actions skill is available as a beta feature. For more information, see [Adding an actions skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-actions-add).\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance. For more information, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\nText messaging integration was renamed\n: The Twilio messaging integration was renamed to SMS with Twilio.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9 October 2020 \n\nSearch skill update","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03353-6854-8737","score":0.6817284822,"text":"\nSave the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1.

Some of these views are designated as output views, while others are non-output views. Non-output views can include some views that are imported into or exported from a module. It is important to note that output views and exported views are orthogonal. For example, a view that is exported does not qualify as a view that is output. In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module. When two or more modules are combined to form an extractor, the duplicate-free union of Document schemas of all modules is the required Document view.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16471-106006-108222","score":0.6683729887,"text":"\nAll other spans are left untouched.\n* LeftToRight\n\nThis policy processes the spans in order from left to right.

By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical. All inputs with a null <consolidate target> result in a single output tuple, which is chosen randomly among those inputs. This behavior is similar to how tuples are consolidated with an identical span in the target column. The exception to resulting in a single output tuple is if the policy is ContainsButNotEqual. In that case, the null <consolidate target> outputs all inputs with null consolidate target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nExample 1: Consolidate on single column\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the field Person.name of all output tuples and to use the ContainedWithin consolidation policy to resolve overlap.\n\nconsolidate on Person.name\nusing 'ContainedWithin'\n\nExample 2: Consolidate on expression, involving multiple columns\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the result of applying the CombineSpans scalar function to fields Person.firstname and Person.lastname in each output tuple.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03268-5869-7269","score":0.6558870077,"text":"\nYou might want to define the customization in the welcome node or another node that is triggered early in the conversation so it is applied any time disambiguation is triggered.\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n]\n},\n\"context\": {\n\"smsAction\": {\n\"command\": \"smsActSetDisambiguationConfig\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"prefixText\": \"%s.\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\nWhen displayed, the assistant shows the introductory text that is configured for disambiguation, such as Did you mean?.

For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Therefore, the version in cache is considered valid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: For event-driven content, purge your cache \n\nFor example, every time a new post is added to your blog, you could easily purge the CIS cache. It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https:\/\/www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path. It can also simplify the number of purge calls made.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only) \n\nPurging by hostname is similar to purging by prefixes.

The server is deleted after the reclamation period ends. During this seven-day reclamation period, you can restore the virtual server, or manually trigger a deletion from [resource reclamations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resourceibmcloud_resource_reclamations).

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

To minimize a single point of failure, IBM Cloud\u00ae architects create resilient designs that have multiple virtual server instances to provide the highest availability.\n\nHowever, extreme failure events, such as data center wide failures due to network outages, natural disasters, or ransomware are harder to anticipate and plan for.

See [Managing DNS records in Cloudflare](https:\/\/developers.cloudflare.com\/dns\/manage-dns-records\/how-to\/create-dns-records\/) for detailed instructions by provider.\n\nAfter you configure your registrar or DNS provider, it can take up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect. When we verify that the specified name servers were configured correctly for your domain or subdomain, the domain's status changes from Pending to Active.\n\nYour domain must move to Active state within 60 days or your domain and any configuration data is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 5.

Type in the information about your DNS record and then click Add record to implement your changes.\n\nAfter creating your records, consider turning on the Proxy setting. Most of the features of CIS require that the internet traffic to your site flow through CIS infrastructure. In other words, it only applies to proxied records and load balancers. To really reap the benefit of CIS, make sure that your DNS records and load balancers have the proxy setting enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting up and manage your caching \n\nNext, you can set up caching. You have the option of three types of caching, available from the caching screen list menu.\n\n\n\n* No query string: Only delivers resources from cache when there is no query string.\n* Query string independent: Delivers the same resource to everyone independent of the query string. The Ignore Query String setting applies only to static file extensions. This setting removes the query string when generating the cache key, so that a request for style.css?something is normalized to style.css when serving from the cache.\n* Query string dependent: Delivers a different resource each time the query string changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge cache \n\nYou can purge your cache to prepare for updates at any time by entering the URL into the purge cache field. You can purge a single file or multiple files (up to 30 at a time).\n\n\n\n\n\n Browser expiration \n\nYou can use the list menu to select the time of browser expiration that you require; for example, 8 hours, or 1 day.\n\nEnterprise only: You can also instruct CIS not to override browser cache control by setting this to Respect Existing Headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using Development mode \n\nDevelopment mode is intended for use when major updates or new file uploads are required, or any time you do not want the end users to work from the cache at all, but to retrieve files directly from the origin servers. To begin using Development Mode, toggle the switch to Enabled position. To stop using Development Mode, toggle the switch to Disabled position. Development mode expires automatically after 3 hours.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-cis-deployment"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04334-152301-153381","score":0.7370076776,"text":"\nIf not set, the context instance specified by ibmcloud cis instance-set INSTANCE is used.<-- <\/section \"id=\"section-command-options-origin-certificate-delete\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-command-example-origin-certificate-delete\" \"> --> Examples Delete origin certificate a5836c2a7ea72d2e225890caea70ae32. ibmcloud cis origin-certificate-delete 31984fea73a15b45779fa0df4ef62f9b a5836c2a7ea72d2e225890caea70ae32 -i cis-demo\n<-- <\/section \"id=\"section-command-example-origin-certificate-delete\" \"> --><-- <\/section \"id=\"section-origin-certificate-delete\" \"> --><-- <\/section \"id=\"section-origin-certificates-cli-ref\" \"> --><-- <section \"id=\"section-overview\" \"> --> Overview View the overview information for a domain.<-- <section \"id=\"section-get-overview\" \"> --> ibmcloud cis overview Show the overview information for a domain. ibmcloud cis overview DNS_DOMAIN_ID -i, --instance INSTANCE] --output FORMAT] ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\n<-- <section \"id=\"section-get-overview-options\" \"> --> Command options DNS_DOMAIN_ID: The ID of DNS domain.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14408-1369-3126","score":0.6382396817,"text":"\n* Simple interconnectivity \u2013 logical network connections are established easily over any physical connection such as public internet, private VPN, or direct link.\n* Layer 2 extension \u2013 on-premises networks are extended into the cloud.

Work with the owner of the domain in your organization to make the necessary changes.\n* I want to keep my current DNS provider for my domain (example.com). Can I delegate a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) from my current DNS provider to CIS?\n\nYes. The process is similar to adding a domain, but instead of the registrar, you work with the DNS provider for the higher level domain. When you add a subdomain to CIS, you are given two name servers to configure, as usual. You configure a Name Server (NS) record for each of the two name servers as DNS records within your domain being managed by the other DNS provider. When we are able to verify that the required NS records have been added, we activate your subdomain. If you do not manage the higher level domain within your organization, you must work with the owner of the higher level domain to get the NS records added.\n* What is TLS?\n\nTLS is a standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links between a web server and a browser in an online communication. A TLS certificate is necessary to create a TLS connection with a website and comprises the domain name, the name of the company, and additional data, such as company address, city, state, and country. The certificate also shows the expiration date and details of the issuing Certificate Authority (CA).\n* How Does TLS Work?\n\nWhen a browser initiates a connection with a TLS secured website, it first retrieves the site's TLS Certificate to check whether the certificate is still valid.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05353-1394-3012","score":0.6589699388,"text":"\n[Prepare to add a custom domain mapping](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/codeengine?topic=codeengine-domain-mappingsprepare-custom-domain) (outside of Code Engine).\n3.

This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible \n\nSome customers use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic, thereby allowing them to proxy all records pointing to their HTTP IP range, and to obscure all non-HTTP traffic with a different IP subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: Configure your security level selectively \n\nYour Security Level establishes the sensitivity of our IP Reputation Database.

Packets can be accepted or dropped according to only basic access control list (ACL) criteria, such as the source and destination fields in the IP or Transmission Control Protocols\/User Datagram Protocol (TCP\/UDP) headers. A stateless Brocade 5400 vRouter does not store connection information and has no requirement to look up every packet's relation to previous flows, both of which consume small amounts of memory and CPU time. Therefore, raw forwarding performance is best on a stateless system. Brocade recommends keeping the router stateless for best performance if you do not require the features specific to statefulness.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-adding-firewall-functions-to-vyatta-5400-stateless-and-stateful-"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-1006129-1007999","score":0.650179863,"text":"\n* How can I filter internet-bound traffic and only allow specific protocols and destinations?\n\nThis is a common question when Source NAT and a firewall must be combined.\n\nKeep in mind the order of operations in the VRA you design your rulesets.\n\nIn short, firewall rules are applied after SNAT.\n\nTo block all outgoing traffic in a firewall, but allow specific SNAT flows, you must move the filtering logic onto your SNAT.

When you add annotation sets to a task, ensure that the sets that you want to compare contain the same overlapping documents. You can see which documents are in an annotation set by opening the Assets> Documents page, clicking the Annotation Sets tab, and then clicking the names of the sets.\n\nYou might experience situations in which no overlapping documents are found. This might happen, for example, if you create annotation sets in two rounds and add them to the same task. Even though the annotation sets were created at about the same time, they don't have any documents in common.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-build-groundtruth"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16417-5155-7505","score":0.6848082542,"text":"\nInterpreting the scores depends on the complexity of your type system, the amount and complexity of the content annotated, how experienced the human annotators are, and other factors.

But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.\n\nGenerally, a type system that includes many entity types and relation types is open to more interpretation, thus inter-annotator agreement might be lower during the early phases of model development.

When the team does start to annotate documents, begin with a small set, perhaps no more than 50.

When you're satisfied with the results of mention annotation, move on to annotate relations and coreferences.\n\nWhile fundamental work is underway to define a set of entity types and mention-annotation guidelines, avoid putting a lot of effort into annotating relation mentions. Mention changes will undo relation annotation work. Do take some time to define a set of relation types and their allowable entity type pairs so that relation type needs are taken into consideration before the entity type inventory is finalized.\n\nExpect the type system to evolve with the experience of people trying to annotate to it. If you revise the type system after you create human annotation tasks, you must decide whether to apply the changes to each task. If you apply the changes, human annotators will have to revisit the documents that they annotated previously.\n\nWhen you test the model, you can review statistics that show how frequently the entity types and relation types occur in your sample documents.

Density can be impacted when a mention that is significant in the domain literature occurs often, but is annotated as different types across the document set.\n\nLow precision is often an indication that you need to improve annotation consistency. To do so, review the annotation guidelines, better train the human annotators, and ensure that human annotators are working in concert and not in isolation from one another.\n\nCheck the inter-annotator agreement score. This score, which measures the degree of agreement between different annotators' output on the same document, is a valuable number. Not only does this score tell you the quality of the ground truth documents that will be used to train the machine learning model, but it also indicates the upper bound of machine learning model performance. A model that is trained on these documents is unlikely to outperform the best agreement that humans can reach. For example, if performance persists at 75 and does not go higher, take a look at the inter-annotator agreement results.

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions. All objects in the bucket must be set with anonymous read or public read access.\n\nFor more information, see [Accelerate delivery of static files using a CDN](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-static-files-cdn).\n\n\n\n\n\n Path-based CDN mappings","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09920-7689-8996","score":0.6552160382,"text":"\nCorrelate documents from different sources \n\nCorrelate content across documents by using the Python NLTK and IBM Data Science Experience.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/patterns\/watson-document-correlation\/)\n* [Get the Code ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/watson-document-co-relation?cm_sp=Developer-_-watson-document-correlation-_-Get-the-Code)\n* [View the Demo ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/youtu.be\/vDCaBPhAr64?cm_sp=Developer-_-watson-document-correlation-_-View-the-Demo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Discover hidden Facebook usage insights \n\nHarness the power of cognitive data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook with PixieDust.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/patterns\/discover-hidden-facebook-usage-insights\/)\n* [Get the Code ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/pixiedust-facebook-analysis?cm_sp=IBMCode-_-discover-hidden-facebook-usage-insights-_-Get-the-Code)\n* [View the Demo !","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-sample-apps"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13406-6795-8870","score":0.6469268203,"text":"\nThe metrics indicate the progress and complexity of the engine's processing:\n\n\n\n* seen_by_engine is audio that the service has read and passed to the engine at least once.\n* received - seen_by_engine is audio that has been buffered at the service but has not yet been seen or processed by the engine.\n* The relationship between the times is received >= seen_by_engine >= transcription >= speaker_labels.\n\n\n\nThe following relationships can also be helpful in understanding the results:\n\n\n\n* The values of the received and seen_by_engine fields are greater than the values of the transcription and speaker_labels fields during speech recognition processing.

This type of update often includes changes to the Kubernetes API or other behaviors that you must prepare your cluster for. Remember that your worker nodes can only be one version behind the master version (n-1). You can update the classic worker node to the same patch by using the ibmcloud oc worker update command.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Update types](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-cs_versionsupdate_types).\n\nWhat happens to my apps during an update?\n: If you run apps as part of a deployment on worker nodes that you update, the apps are rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster. These worker nodes might be in a different worker pool, or if you have stand-alone worker nodes, apps might be scheduled onto stand-alone worker nodes. To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload.\n\nHow can I control how many worker nodes go down at a time during an update or reload?\n: If you need all your worker nodes to be up and running, consider [resizing your worker pool](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_pool_resize) or [adding stand-alone worker nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_add) to add more worker nodes. You can remove the additional worker nodes after the update is completed.\n\nIn addition, you can create a Kubernetes config map that specifies the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time, such as during an update. Worker nodes are identified by the worker node labels. You can use IBM-provided labels or custom labels that you added to the worker node.\n\nThe Kubernetes config map rules are used for updating worker nodes only.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-update"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05337-16228-17543","score":0.6268891096,"text":"\n1.20.1 07 October 2021 <br><br> * Updated translations for the CLI.<br><br><br> \n 1.20.0 04 October 2021 <br><br> * Updated the project delete and reclamation delete commands so that if the project is in hard deletion failed status, the user can retry the commands.<br> * Updated the build create command to change the default value for the --commit option from main to empty.

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports\/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-cm-7"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16030-3224-5225","score":0.6718290448,"text":"\nSix different types of virtual server instance data packet flows occur in a VPC.

It routes the data packet to the correct destination hypervisor. If the destination hypervisor is different from the source hypervisor, the data packet is tagged with the proper VNI and sent to the destination hypervisor. There, the VNI is stripped off and the data packet is forwarded to the destination virtual server instance.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16295-7-1721","score":0.6826924682,"text":"\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

When you apply the latest version, you benefit from the continuous improvements, feature additions, and bug fixes that are made to the web chat regularly.\n\nHowever, if you apply extensive customizations to your deployment, such as overriding the theme with your own custom theme, for example, you might want to lock your deployment to a specific version. Locking on a version enables you to test new versions before you apply them to your live web chat.\n\nTo use a specific version (clientVersion=\"major.minor.patch\"), specify it as follows:\n\nThe following examples show what to specify when the current version is 2.3.1.\n\n\n\n* If you want to stay on a major version, but get the latest minor and patch releases, specify clientVersion=\"2\".\n* If you want to stay on a minor version, but get the latest patch releases, specify clientVersion=\"2.3\".\n* If you want to lock on to a specific minor version and patch release, specify clientVersion=\"2.3.1\".\n\n\n\nTo test the updates in a version release of web chat before you apply the version to your live web chat, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Lock the web chat that is running in your production environment to a specific version.\n2. Embed your web chat deployment into a new page in a test environment, and then override the version lock setting. For example, specify clientVersion=\"latest\".\n3.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16387-7-1890","score":0.7028577328,"text":"\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public\/private key pair.

Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03166-1557-3458","score":0.6956464052,"text":"\nA preview pane is displayed that shows you what the web chat looks like when it is embedded in a web page.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03422-14609-15163","score":0.7086228728,"text":"\ninstance.render();\n}\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security measures \n\nThe web chat integration undergoes tests and scans on a regular basis to find and address potential security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nBe sure to run your own security reviews to see how the web chat fits in with your current website structure and policies. The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has.

The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant. After your assistant is live, the built-in metrics of active user conversations help you understand what your customers are asking about, how well your assistant is able to meet their needs, and what to focus on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n 3. Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant.

The parameter is not available for previous-generation models.\n\nThe character_insertion_bias parameter controls the service's bias for competing strings of different lengths during speech recognition. With next-generation models, the service parses audio character by character. As it does, it establishes hypotheses of previous character strings to help determine viable next characters. During this process, it collects candidate strings of different lengths.\n\nBy default, each model uses a default character_insertion_bias of 0.0. This value is optimized to produce the best balance between hypotheses with different numbers of characters. The default is typically adequate for most speech recognition. However, certain use cases might benefit from favoring hypotheses with shorter or longer strings of characters. In such cases, specifying a change from the default can improve speech recognition.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-parsing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02932-6045-6990","score":0.6921622157,"text":"\nAnd the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

The new prompt reflects any changes to the text or the audio of the prompt along with any custom word pronunciations defined since the prompt was first created. You can always pass the same text and audio that you used to create the original prompt if you are rerecording the prompt after adding a custom word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Custom prompts \n\nA custom prompt is defined by text and audio that speaks that text with the prosody that you want the service's voices to duplicate. The service extracts and analyzes the prosody from the prompt's audio. It then applies that prosodic information when it speaks the prompt's text with one of its own voices.\n\nIt is important to understand that when you use a prompt during speech synthesis, the service does not use the audio of the prompt itself. It instead uses the voice that you specify with the synthesis request. That voice adopts the prosody of the spoken audio from the prompt.\n\nWhen you add a prompt to a custom model, you define the prompt by providing the text that is to be spoken, the recorded audio for that text, a unique user-specified identifier for the prompt, and an optional speaker model. The service generates and stores prosodic data for the prompt and uses the data to produce synthesized audio upon request. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a custom model to add a prompt to it.\n\nAlways assign a meaningful name as the value of a prompt ID. For example, use a name like goodbye to indicate a prompt that speaks a standard farewell message. Prompt IDs must be unique within a given custom model, so you cannot define two prompts with the same ID for the same model. If you provide the ID of an existing prompt, the previously uploaded prompt is replaced by the new information. The service reprocesses the existing prompt by using the new text and audio, and it updates the prosodic data that is associated with the prompt.\n\nWhen it processes a request to add a prompt, the service attempts to align the text and the audio that are provided for the prompt.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-tbe-intro"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13360-1543-3265","score":0.6823638678,"text":"\nIt can also return no result if the input clearly does not match one of the two phrases.\n\nFor instance, if the user replies yes, the service likely returns a response that is very much like the following result.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13359-2732-4499","score":0.6807105541,"text":"\n* ABNF - [vins.abnf](https:\/\/watson-developer-cloud.github.io\/doc-tutorial-downloads\/speech-to-text\/grammars\/vins.abnf)\n* XML - [vins.xml](https:\/\/watson-developer-cloud.github.io\/doc-tutorial-downloads\/speech-to-text\/grammars\/vins.xml)\n\n\n\nFor more information about the VIN format, see [Vehicle identification number](https:\/\/wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vehicle_identification_number).\n\n\n\n\n\n Grammars with optional elements \n\nBy making certain elements of a response optional, you can make grammars more flexible by anticipating how users might respond.

For example, when the intent is to get a weather forecast, the relevant location and date entities are required before the application can return an accurate forecast.\n\nRecognizing entities in the user's input helps you to craft more useful, targeted responses. For example, you might have a buy_something intent. When a user makes a request that triggers the buy_something intent, the assistant's response should reflect an understanding of what the something is that the customer wants to buy. You can add a @product entity, and then use it to extract information from the user input about the product that the customer is interested in. (The @ prepended to the entity name helps to clearly identify it as an entity.)\n\nFinally, you can add multiple responses to your dialog tree with wording that differs based on the @product value that is detected in the user's request.\n\n\n\n Entity evaluation overview \n\nYour assistant detects entities in the user input by using one of the following evaluation methods:\n\n\n\n Dictionary-based method \n\nYour assistant looks for terms in the user input that match the values, synonyms, or patterns you define for the entity.\n\n\n\n* Synonym entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (color), and then one or more values in that category (blue). For each value you specify a bunch of synonyms (aqua, navy). You can also pick synonyms to add from recommendations made to you by Watson.\n\nAt run time, your assistant recognizes terms in the user input that exactly match the values or synonyms that you defined for the entity as mentions of that entity.\n* Pattern entity: You define a category of terms as an entity (contact_info), and then one or more values in that category (email).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-entities"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09921-1508-2973","score":0.6682635546,"text":"\nsatisfied An affective response to perceived service quality \n sympathetic An affective mode of understanding that involves emotional resonance \n\n\n\n\n\n* Example response:\n\n{\n\"usage\": {\n\"text_units\": 1,\n\"text_characters\": 60,\n\"features\": 1\n},\n\"language\": \"en\",\n\"classifications\": [\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.564849,\n\"class_name\": \"excited\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.355816,\n\"class_name\": \"satisfied\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.126127,\n\"class_name\": \"polite\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.026995,\n\"class_name\": \"sympathetic\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.012211,\n\"class_name\": \"frustrated\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.011065,\n\"class_name\": \"sad\"\n},\n{\n\"confidence\": 0.000872,\n\"class_name\": \"impolite\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Migrating from Watson Tone Analyzer Customer Engagement endpoint to Natural Language Understanding \n\nYou can migrate your [Watson Tone Analyzer customer-engagement](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/tone-analyzer?topic=tone-analyzer-utco) analysis requests to Natural Language Understanding.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb\/vpc\/images\/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16065-1526-3778","score":0.7197934985,"text":"\nThese nodes also run a small set of control plane agent services, as described in this table. \n Bare metal nodes Bare metal nodes are delivered to you dedicatedly with VMware ESXi installed during provision.

All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. \n VPC control plane services Your VPC API requests are routed to services deployed across control nodes in the region. These services are replicated for availability and performance across multiple zones in the region whenever necessary. In addition to servicing API requests, these services monitor the region's hardware and capabilities, and perform orchestration to keep your VPC resources available and performing optimally. All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. Since your instances do not run on control nodes, they are separated from these services. \n VPC control plane agent services A small set of VPC control plane agents is deployed across hypervisor nodes in the region. For example, agents are used to create new virtual server instances on the nodes, and to forward logs, metrics, and alerts off the node for use by the broader VPC control plane services. All communication between control plane services occurs over a secure, encrypted network. \n VPC control plane data store Your VPC resources are persisted in a data store that is replicated across all zones in the region. This store contains metadata about these resources only, and does not contain your data. For example, this store contains information about each VPC Image resource, such as its name, CRN, and creation date. However, it does not contain the image data itself, which is hosted on the storage devices.

You might alter this architecture for your needs, but it is important to understand the separation of VMware infrastructure networking requirements and the need to separate it from other workload traffic.\n\n\n\n VPC subnets \n\nThe VMkernel networking in VMware provides connectivity to hosts and handles the standard system traffic of vSphere\u00ae vMotion, IP storage, Fault Tolerance, vSAN\u2122, and others. You can also create VMkernel adapters (VMK) on the source and target vSphere Replication hosts to isolate the vSphere replication data traffic.\n\nIt is recommended to take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the management and system traffic in your vSphere environment, such as:\n\n\n\n* Isolate the vMotion traffic in a separate network that includes only the ESXi hosts that participate in the migration.\n* Isolate the management traffic in a network that only network and security administrators can access.\n* Isolate the NSX-T\u2122 TEP traffic only to the Transport Nodes and to interfaces that need access to TEP traffic.\n\n\n\nAs there are various System Traffic Types in VMware, it is recommended to dedicate a separate VMkernel adapter for every System Traffic Type. And also, isolate traffic in logical segments in the underlying network infrastructure and dedicate a distributed port group in distributed switches.\n\nIn IBM Cloud VPC, there are multiple ways to do logical segmentation or isolation. The architecture represented here uses a traditional VLAN segmentation analogy. Each System Traffic Type or VMK has its own VPC subnet that can then be controlled with subnet ACLs.\n\nZoom\n\n![VPC design for VMware deployment](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/5bdb37c0149145723c5437e8176651928565e722\/vmwaresolutions\/images\/vpc-ryo-diagrams-vpc-physical.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12791-59012-61053","score":0.6906147599,"text":"\nBilling \n\nYou can give users access to update account settings, view subscriptions, view offers, apply subscription and feature codes, update spending limits, and track usage by using the Billing service.\n\n\n\nTable 4.
