Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port.

(Per-minute pricing is different for the Standard plan.)\n\nFor information about pricing for the Plus and Standard plans, see the Speech to Text service in the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Catalog](https://%7BDomainName%7D/catalog/speech-to-text).\n* Do you round up to the nearest minute for every call to the API?\n\nIBM does not round up the length of the audio for every API call that the service receives. Instead, IBM aggregates all usage for the month and rounds to the nearest minute at the end of the month. For example, if you send two audio files that are each 30 seconds long, IBM sums the duration of the total audio for that month to one minute.\n* Am I charged for all audio that I send, even audio that does not include speech?\n\nYes, all audio that you send to the service contributes to your cumulative minutes of audio. This includes silence and noisy audio that does not contain or otherwise contribute to speech recognition. Because the service must process all audio that it receives, it does not distinguish between the type or quality of audio that you send. For pricing purposes, three seconds of silence is equivalent to three seconds of actual speech.\n* What advantages do I get by using a Speech to Text Premium plan?\n\nThe Premium plan offers developers and organizations all of the capabilities and features of the Plus plan. The plan also offers these additional features:\n\n\n\n* The ability to use IBM Watson\u00ae services in the IBM Cloud\u00ae with data isolation and added security features such as IBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae (also referred to as Bring your own keys (BYOK)), Service Endpoints, Mutual Authentication, and US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) readiness.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16274-8427-10190", "score": 12.44437, "text": "\nProperties of the assistant_interaction_summaries.turns[].response object\n\n Property Type Description \n\n type String The response type:<br><br><br><br> * text_to_speech: a command to play an utterance to the caller<br> * sms: a command to send an SMS message to the caller<br> * url: a command to play an audio file to the caller<br> * transfer: a command to transfer a call<br> * text_to_speech_config: a command to change the Text to Speech settings<br> * speech_to_text_config: a command to change the Speech to Text settings<br> * pause_speech_to_text: a command to stop speech recognition<br> * unpause_speech_to_text: a command to start speech recognition<br> * pause_dtmf: a command to stop processing of inbound DTMF signals<br> * unpause_dtmf: unpause_dtmf: a command to start processing of inbound DTMF signals<br> * enable_speech_barge_in: a command to enable speech barge-in so that callers can interrupt playback by speaking<br> * disable_speech_barge_in: a command to disable speech barge-in so that playback isn't interrupted when callers speak during audio playback<br> * enable_dtmf_barge_in: a command to enable DTMF barge-in so that callers can interrupt playback from the phone integration by pressing a key<br> * disable_dtmf_barge_in: a command to disable DTMF barge-in so that playback from the phone integration isn't interrupted when the caller presses a key<br> * dtmf: a command to send DTMF signals to the caller<br> * hangup: a command to disconnect the call <br> See [Mapping between CDR and Watson Assistant response types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-cdr-log-referencecdr-log-reference-response-type-mapping).<br><br><br> \n barge_in_occurred Boolean Whether barge-in occurred during the turn.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-cdr-log-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03158-23545-25765", "score": 12.138941, "text": "\nThe SIP trunk service sends a SIP INVITE HTTP request to your assistant's phone integration to establish a connection.\n3.

The welcome node of the dialog is processed. The response text is sent to the Text to Speech service to be converted to audio and the audio is sent to the caller.\n6. When the customer says something, the audio is converted to text by the Speech to Text service and is sent to your assistant's dialog skill for evaluation.\n7.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test?

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-updates"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08016-1485-3419", "score": 17.074835, "text": "\n[Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage) stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations. Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\nAll Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by Hyper Protect Crypto Services. For more information, see [Encryption at rest](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-at-rest). In addition, a geographically separate region should be used as an [alternative storage site](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-bcdryour-workloads-requirements-alternate-storage-site). This means you should use [cross region resiliency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpointsendpoints-geo) for all of your Object Storage buckets.\n\nTo start working with Object Storage, see the following instructions:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05167-7-1758", "score": 16.98813, "text": "\nUpload data \n\nAfter getting your storage organized into buckets, it's time to add some objects by uploading data.\n\nDepending on how you want to use your storage, there are different ways to get data into the system. A data scientist has a few large files that are used for analytics, a systems administrator needs to keep database backups synchronized with local files, and a developer is writing software that needs to read and write millions of files. Each of these scenarios is best served by different methods of data ingest.\n\nSome applications may wish to restrict a user or Service ID to only uploading data, without any access to reading data in a bucket. This is possible through the Object Writer [IAM role](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam).\n\n\n\n Using the console \n\nTypically, using the web-based console is not the most common way to use Object Storage. Objects are limited to 200 MB and the file name and key are identical. Multiple objects can be uploaded at the same time, and if the browser allows for multiple threads each object will be uploaded by using multiple parts in parallel. Support for larger object sizes and improved performance (depending on network factors) is provided by [Aspera high-speed transfer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-aspera).\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a compatible tool \n\nSome users want to use a stand-alone utility to interact with their storage. As the Cloud Object Storage API supports the most common set of S3 API operations, many S3-compatible tools can also connect to Object Storage by using [HMAC credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-uhc-hmac-credentials-main).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10864-7221-9477", "score": 16.956228, "text": "\nSupported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems. Cloud Functions rules and sequences provide flexibility to change the processing pipeline without programming, and is performed through simple configuration updates. The data store options and low administrative maintenance make a Cloud Functions based system highly agile, and easily adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cognitive \n\nCognitive technologies can be effectively combined with Cloud Functions to create powerful applications. For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them. This technology is the \u201ccognitive\u201d extension of the [Data Processing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_casesuse_cases_data) use case that was discussed earlier. Another good use for Cloud Functions is to implement Bot function that is combined with cognitive services.\n\nA sample application, [Dark vision](https://github.com/IBM-cloud/openwhisk-darkvisionapp), is provided and does just that. In this application, the user uploads a video or image by using the Dark Vision web application, which stores it in an IBM Cloudant DB. Once the video is uploaded, Cloud Functions detect the new video by listening to IBM Cloudant changes (trigger). Cloud Functions then triggers the video extractor action. During its execution, the extractor produces frames (images) and stores them in IBM Cloudant. The frames are then processed with Watson Visual Recognition, and the results are stored in the same IBM Cloudant DB. The results can be viewed by using the Dark Vision web application or an iOS application. IBM Cloud Object Storage can be used in addition to IBM Cloudant, where video and image metadata are stored in IBM Cloudant, and the media files are stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n Event processing with Kafka or Event Streams \n\nCloud Functions is ideally to be used in combination with Kafka, IBM\u00ae Event Streams for IBM Cloud\u00ae (Kafka based), and other messaging systems. The event driven nature of those systems requires an event driven runtime to process messages.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13064-7-2233", "score": 16.86369, "text": "\nWhat is IBM Cloud Object Storage? \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage is a highly available, durable, and secure platform for storing unstructured data. Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05139-7-1805", "score": 16.75987, "text": "\nData security \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage uses an innovative approach for cost-effectively storing large volumes of unstructured data that ensures security, availability, and reliability.\n\nThis level of security is accomplished by using Information Dispersal Algorithms (IDAs) to separate data into unrecognizable \u201cslices\u201d. The system distributes these slices across a network of data centers, making transmission and storage of data inherently private and secure. No complete copy of the data resides in any single storage node, and only a subset of nodes needs to be available in order to fully retrieve the data on the network.\n\nAll data in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted at rest. This technology individually encrypts each object by using per-object generated keys. These keys are secured and reliably stored by using the same Information Dispersal Algorithms that protect object data by using an All-or-Nothing Transform (AONT).

In the simplest case, the text you specify here can more explicitly state the type of information you need the user to provide. If you use this action with a conditional response, be sure to word the conditional response such that you clearly state what was wrong with the user's answer and what you expect them to provide instead.\n* Prompt again: After displaying the Not found response, your assistant repeats the slot prompt again and waits for the user to respond. If you use this action with a conditional response, the response can merely explain what was wrong about the answer the user provided. It does not need to reiterate the type of information you want the user to provide because the slot prompt typically explains that.\n\nIf you choose this option, consider adding at least one variation of the Not found response so that the user does not see the exact same text more than once. Take the opportunity to use different wording to explain to the user what information you need them to provide and in what format.\n* Skip this slot: Instructs your assistant to stop trying to fill the current slot, and instead, move on to the prompt for the next empty slot. This option is useful in a slot where you want to both make the slot optional and to display a prompt that asks the user for information. For example, you might have a @seating entity that captures restaurant seating preferences, such as outside, near the fireplace, private, and so on. You can add a slot that prompts the user with, Do you have any seating preferences? and checks for @seating.values.

A large bank, for example, might have only one account (controlled by executive leadership) and separate service instances for each of the organizational units within the bank (for example, one unit might manage bank accounts while another manages loans). While it is likely that users with rights at the account level will also have rights over the various instances (and perhaps, though not always, the other way around), note that the names given to account roles are different than those for the roles within the service instances, reflecting this difference between account roles and service instance roles. For more information on those roles, their names, and their permissions, check out [IAM roles and actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions).\n\n\n\n How IAM access works \n\nAfter you set up and organize resource groups in your account, you can take advantage of a couple of strategies to streamline the access management process:\n\nAccess groups", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-manage-access"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12545-7-2359", "score": 20.483444, "text": "\nUser management for enterprises \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae enterprises are valuable for large companies or organizations that need to group a set of accounts while still maintaining a separation and isolation between the accounts for different departments or teams. The management of users and their access to resources in each account remains entirely separate even when the accounts are added and organized in an enterprise.\n\nSee [What is an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) for more information about enterprises.\n\nThe user list for each child account in an enterprise is accessible only to users in that child account. This means the users who are invited to the enterprise and the users who are invited to the accounts within the enterprise remain entirely separate. This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources. If you add a user to an enterprise account that contains a number of accounts, those users do not automatically have access to manage those accounts as far as user management, billing, and more. The enterprise account users also don't have access to any resources in other accounts within the enterprise.\n\nIf you want a user to manage the enterprise and have access to resources within child accounts, you must invite them to both accounts.

Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.\n\nWhen compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:\n\n\n\n* Centralized account management: View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view.

Or, you might isolate certain workloads in separate accounts to meet security or compliance guidelines. As the number of accounts grows, it can become more difficult to track resource usage and associated costs.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises offer a simpler way to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you can create a multi-tiered hierarchy of accounts by adding new or existing accounts and nesting them in account groups. How you structure your enterprise is up to you. For example, for a large organization, you might organize your accounts by geography, or by department. You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise.

The enterprise account manages billing for the entire enterprise, with usage costs from all accounts that are rolled up and paid from the enterprise account.\n* Account groups, which you can use to organize related accounts. Account groups can't contain resources themselves, but you can view costs for resource usage from the accounts that they contain.\n* Accounts, which are just like stand-alone IBM Cloud accounts in that they contain resources and resource groups, Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces, and independent access permissions.

This capability's usefulness depends on your enterprise structure because usage data is aggregated by each account group and account. Create account groups for projects that function under a common budget. See [How can I use an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterpriseenterprise-use-cases) for examples.\n\nThe enterprise administrator or your financial officer might not be familiar with each individual account or account group. To make it easier to identify their purpose, give each account and account group a human-readable name. If your company uses billing codes, you can also incorporate them into the name. For example, instead of a devteam account group with fed ui and be api accounts, create the Development - A2B3 account group with Front-end UI team and Back-end API team accounts.\n\nAn enterprise user with Administrator or Editor access can edit the enterprise and account group names, but they can't change account names. To edit an account name, a user must be in the account itself.\n\nBecause you have a unified view of all usage that's organized by your account groups and accounts, you can charge back usage costs to the associated teams.

Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API. For more information, see [Viewing usage in an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Invoicing and payments \n\nUsage in the enterprise is invoiced through the enterprise account. As with all billable accounts, usage is invoiced monthly, and the invoice is due on the billing date for your account. During each billing cycle, a single invoice with the usage costs from all accounts is made available in the enterprise account. The invoice contains costs for all platform and infrastructure usage as a single-line item in your invoice.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10906-5101-6829", "score": 12.9697, "text": "\nConsider the following when determining whether you need an enterprise or a stand-alone account:<br><br><br><br> * In an enterprise, subscription discounts and cloud credits are available to all accounts that are in the enterprise.<br> * Stand-alone accounts control their own billing.

Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3.

This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it.

If no header exists, hardcoded names, such as column_0 and column_1, are applied to the columns. Specify column names to ensure that the resulting document fields have meaningful names.\n* If you want to find trends over time, be sure that each record has some date information that can be used to plot the information on a timeline.\n\nDiscovery recognizes the following date formats automatically:\n\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSX\nyyyy-MM-dd\nM/d/yy\nyyyyMMdd\nyyyy/MM/dd\n\nIf you store dates in other formats, you can add the format to the list of supported formats.\n\nFrom the Discovery user interface, open the Manage collection page.

The Target location field displays where the result is stored. An initial bucket in one of your Object Storage instances is automatically created for you when you open the UI.

Normally, Data Engine always appends jobid=<jobid> to the provided target path to ensure a unique result location with each query execution. However, in the following sample query, this suffix is eliminated by adding JOBPREFIX NONE to the path in the INTO clause.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-running"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-4203-6131", "score": 19.57975, "text": "\n10 200 97.5 102.5 \n 11 300 97.5 202.5 \n 12 400 97.5 302.5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n cosResultClause \n\nYou can use the Cloud Object Storage result clause to apply detailed control over the location, format, and layout of the SQL query result set being stored on Cloud Object Storage.\n\nThe default is JOBPREFIX JOBID, which means that jobid= is always appended to the target prefix. You can optionally specify JOBID NONE, which skips the appending of jobid=. The results are then written exactly to the requested path. However, if that path contains existing objects (for example, from a previous query execution with the same target path), all existing objects get removed when the new result objects are written.\n\nA query cannot run if JOBPREFIX NONE is specified and the target overlaps with at least one of the input URIs. The reason is that data cannot be overwritten by a query that is reading that same data. For example, SELECT * FROM cos://us-geo/mybucket/myprefix/mysubprefix INTO cos://us-geo/mybucket/myprefix JOBPREFIX NONE returns an error when you try to submit it.\n\nIn the COS result clause, you can explicitly specify the storage location and type of a query result on Cloud Object Storage. The storage location is specified by a COSURI.\n\nValid query result object formats are: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC, and PARQUET. Object type names are not case-sensitive.\n\nBeing able to explicitly specify the location and the type of the result object enables a user to take the following actions:\n\n\n\n* Read raw data stored in one format, for example, CSV.\n* Cleanse the data by using SQL constructs.\n* Store the cleansed data in a format that offers benefits regarding query performance and storage consumption on Cloud Object Storage, for example, a column-based object format, such as Parquet.\n\n\n\nMoreover, a user can explicitly define the way a query result is stored physically on Cloud Object Storage by using the result partitioned clause.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"}]}

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary.

So continuing the preceding examples, if filter B has an empty before field, then it is applied last, but if filter D is created with an empty before field, then B's before field is modified to point to D, so B is applied before D. <br> Example: 1a15dcab-7e40-45e1-b7c5-bc690eaa9782<br><br><br> \n ge <br>integer IP prefix greater than or equal to this number is processed.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-adding-prefix-filters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06308-0-500", "score": 16.771732, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  APIs and SDKs \n\nWatson Query provides REST APIs that you can use to interact with your instance.\n\nTo access data, view and create database objects, administer, and monitor your service, use the [Watson Query APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/data-virtualization-on-cloud).\n\nThe following Watson Query SDKs are supported by IBM:\n\n\n\n*  [Go SDK](https://github.com/IBM/data-virtualization-on-cloud-go-sdk/)\n*  [Java SDK](https://github.com/IBM/data-virtualization-on-cloud-java-sdk/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/data-virtualization?topic=data-virtualization-con_rest_api"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00512-5160-7348", "score": 16.112337, "text": "\nSee also a brief overview of the underlying querying mechanism that you use to select the query mechanism that is best for each query your application needs to make.\n\n\n\n Global querying \n\nYou can make global queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a global query, the database must perform a scatter-gather operation across all data in the database. This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage.

The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions. For more information, see the section on [partitioned tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogpartitioned).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13480-3420-5386", "score": 17.807617, "text": "\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions. For more information, see the section on [partitioned tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogpartitioned).\n\nYou can then query the table by name instead of specifying the Object Storage URI directly in the SQL statement:\n\nSELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10\n\nIf you want to use more specific data types than the data types inferred by automatic schema detection, you can also specify the table schema explicitly:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees (\nemployeeID int,\nlastName string,\nfirstName string,\ntitle string,\ntitleOfCourtesy string,\nbirthDate timestamp,\nhireDate timestamp,\naddress string,\ncity string,\nregion string,\npostalCode string,\ncountry string,\nhomePhone string,\nextension int,\nphoto string,\nnotes string,\nreportsTo string,\nphotoPath string\n)\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\nShow more\n\nIf accessing the table in a SELECT statement does not work as expected, it is possibly caused by improper specification of the table schema in the CREATE TABLE statement. The column names and their data types in your CREATE TABLE statement must match the result of the following query:\n\nSELECT * FROM describe (<data-location> stored as <storage-format>)\n\nColumn names are case-sensitive. Incorrect column name specification results in an empty column, that is, the column seems to contain no data. To solve such a problem, use the automatic schema detection, reorder the columns, or omit some columns.\n\nThe SHOW TABLES statement provides you with an overview of the existing tables in your instance. This statement allows an optional search filter to limit the number of results:\n\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'cus'\n\nIt is not possible to use a different namespace than default.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16638-0-764", "score": 17.040781, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Creating table from a file \n\nFiles can also be ingested or imported to IBM\u00ae watsonx.data through the overflow menu of schema in the Data explorer page to create tables.\n\n\n\n1.

CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00646-3898-5632", "score": 21.781174, "text": "\nFor example, when your webpage is first loaded, it calls the GET /todolist endpoint. The GET /todolist endpoint uses the postFind method to query the database for all documents (by using the index created after the todo database), and then orders the notes by timestamp, and returns them to the front end for display.\n\nFiltering by tag uses the same postFind method, but by using the second index, you create and delete notes by using the postDocument and deleteDocument methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIBM Cloudant allows rapid development of web applications, as its HTTP API is modeled by the [Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm-cloud/cloudant) and is easy to integrate with your own code. You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant). Don't forget. The [IBM Cloudant Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-connectingibm-cloudant-dashboard) is a great way to explore your databases, create and modify documents, and refine your index and querying skills.\n\nYou can find more best practice guidance in our [blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/11/21/Best-and-Worst-Practices.html) and [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant/getting-started.html).

Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3. A report that details the number of books that are published by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00469-13046-15136", "score": 20.971407, "text": "\nYou might find that you\u2019re mainly hitting the Query limit, but you have plenty of headroom in Lookups. It might be possible to reduce the reliance on Queries through some remodeling of the data or perhaps doing more work client-side.\n\nThe corollary here though is that you can\u2019t assume that any third-party library or framework optimizes for cost ahead of convenience. Client-side frameworks that support multiple persistence layers by using plug-ins are unlikely to be aware of this situation, or might be incapable of making such tradeoffs.\n\nChecking for third-party library or framework compatibility before you commit to a particular tool is a good idea.\n\nIt is also worth understanding that the rates aren\u2019t directly equivalent to HTTP API endpoint calls. You must expect that, for example, a bulk update counts according to its constituent document writes.\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant documentation on [plans and pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public) on IBM public cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Logging helps you see what\u2019s going on \n\nIBM Cloudant\u2019s logs indicating each API call made, what was requested and how long it took to respond can be automatically spooled to LogDNA for analysis and reporting for IBM Cloud-based services.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 20.896208, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century. The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Indexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Indexing video \n\nLearn how indexing can speed up your query process.\n\n\n\n* Indexing video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 11 - Indexing.\n\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}]}

Version 4 uses new architecture and a different scanning engine.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023. For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret. For more information about image pull secrets, see [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).\n\n\n\n Types of image registries \n\nImages are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry).\n\nPublic registries, such as public Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker and Code Engine to create your first application or job. But when it comes to enterprise workloads, use a private registry, such as the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API. The core network services that are offered by NSX are:\n\n\n\n Logical switches \n\nA cloud deployment or a virtual data center might have various applications across multiple tenants.

This approach might blur the lines between the virtualization administrator, typically responsible for the compute and storage infrastructure, the network administrator, and the security administrator.\n\nThe IBM Cloud for VMware Regulated Workloads architecture restores the strict separation of duties that are usually enforced in an on-premises environment.\n\nThe IBM Cloud for VMware Regulated Workloads architecture spreads the delivery of necessary services across purpose-built regions.\n\nThe management region allows the virtualization administrator to manage the entire compute and storage infrastructure. Through the adoption of NSX-T\u2122 as the SDN provider for the workloads, it removes the network and security administration duties from the scope of the virtualization administrator role. NSX-T, unlike NSX for vSphere, is not reliant upon a vCenter to manage the SDN network objects, traffic flows, and security configurations. Divorcing the network control plane from the vCenter means it is no longer possible for the virtualization administrator to view or change anything that impacts the network. The network and security administrators use the NSX-T dedicated management portal to configure the network and the required security policies.\n\nThe edge services region is strictly limited to the protection of the management region and the vSphere components that deliver compute and storage resources to the workload region. The security administrator, who has the responsibility of managing the SDN security, might also serve as the administrator of the gateway VMs that run on the gateway cluster. Or, to isolate a single administrator's scope of influence, the responsibility might be assigned to an administrator who has access only to the edge gateway and no access to manage SDN security.\n\nThe workload region is managed by one or more administrators that are only responsible for the management of the application VMs deployed upon the workload clusters.

For more details about other benefits of Subscription accounts, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n How subscription credit is spent \n\nSubscriptions can provide the following two types of credit, which are divided into separate pools:\n\n\n\n* Credit from platform subscriptions that pays for resource usage\n* Credit from support subscriptions that pays for support costs\n\n\n\nEach platform or support subscription is purchased for a given credit amount and duration. If the subscription duration is more than a year, the subscription is separated into terms of up to one year each. Each term has distinct start dates, end dates, and available credit. You can use the available credit at any point during the term, but credit doesn't roll over to any following terms in the subscription. You can get extra flexibility to use credit from terms that haven't yet started by paying up-front for the entire subscription rather than using monthly, quarterly, or another recurring billing cadence. If your usage exceeds your available credit, the extra usage is billed as overage at the non-discounted rate.\n\nFor example, say that you buy an IBM Cloud platform subscription for $1,000 a month for two years, and the subscription starts 1 July 2019.

With this billing model, you commit to spend a certain amount on IBM Cloud and you also receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount.

Then, choose to order Direct Link Connect or Direct Link Dedicated. As you complete the ordering form, cost estimates appear in the Summary side panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n In terms of cost, what do I pay for? \n\nThere are two pricing plans: metered and unmetered. Metered has a port fee and bill per GB egressed across the Direct Link. Unmetered billing has a higher port fee and no usage charges, which are ideal for customers who consistently egress traffic across their direct link.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I change billing options after my direct link is provisioned? \n\nYes, you can change billing options after a direct link is provisioned, regardless of whether you chose global or local routing. For example, to change from metered to unmetered billing, navigate to the Details page of the direct link and click Edit. In the side panel, select Unmetered in the Billing section, review the updated information, then agree to the prerequisites and click Submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n When does billing begin with Direct Link? \n\nThe fees for Direct Link cover the cost of service termination on the IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nInfrastructure services are billed in advance and begin upon acceptance of a client\u2019s order. However, due to the nature of IBM Cloud Direct Link, the Direct Link service billing begins when a BGP session is established with IBM Cloud, or 30 days after the order is submitted.\n\nBilling stops after (1) you request a circuit to be deleted, and (2) the provider has de-provisioned the circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n What extra charges will I incur from other parties with Direct Link? \n\nYou might have extra charges from your provider. See to your carrier or service provider for their fee information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What is planned for Direct Link on Classic Exchange? \n\nThe marketplace has evolved since Direct Link Exchange was established. With data center operators now blurring the lines as network service providers, IBM will be combining the Exchange offering with Connect on the new \"next generation\" platform to reflect both this change and simplify the Direct Link portfolio. Direct Link Exchange will service only the Direct Link classic infrastructure.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01705-5444-7439", "score": 19.79998, "text": "\nWhen you register with IBM Cloud, you get a Pay-As-You-Go account, and you receive a [$200 credit](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account) to help get you started.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16288-1733-3996", "score": 17.179346, "text": "\nIt's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call. This 503 response can then be used by the SIP trunking provider to reroute the call to another region. If you want to take advantage of this capability, open a service ticket against the Watson Assistant service instance that requires disaster recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure the phone connection \n\nYou can add security to the phone connection by going to the Advanced options tab in the phone integration settings, and selecting one or both of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Force secure trunking: Select this option to use Secure Real-Time Transfer Protocol (SRTP) to secure the audio that is transmitted over the phone. For more information about RTP, see [Call routing details](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-route).\n* Enable SIP authentication: Select this option if you want to require SIP digest authentication.\n\nWhen SIP authentication is required, all inbound traffic (meaning requests from the SIP provider to your assistant) is authenticated using SIP digest authentication, and must be sent using Transport Layer Security (TLS). If this option is selected, the SIP digest user name and password must be configured, and the SIP trunk being used to connect to Assistant must be configured to use only TLS.\n\nIf you use Twilio as your SIP trunk provider, you cannot enable SIP authentication for outbound SIP trunks to Watson Assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying advanced SIP trunk configuration settings \n\nTo configure how your assistant interacts with a SIP trunk from an external provider, go to the SIP trunk tab in the phone integration settings, and update the following options in the SIP trunking integration section:\n\n\n\n* SIP INVITE headers to extract: List the headers that you want your assistant to use.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03312-3639-6036", "score": 15.6894, "text": "\nA Watson Assistant phone integration in one region is unaware of a phone integration in a different region. You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-failover"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16321-20604-22275", "score": 15.619186, "text": "\n\"message\": \"Sorry, I could not find an agent.\"\n},\n\"message_to_human_agent\": \"The caller needs help resetting their password\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Transferring upon failure \n\nTo configure transfer on failures, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings.

If User-to-User is specified in the transfer_headers list, the session history key is sent in the X-Watson-Assistant-Session-History-Key header.\n\nThe value of the SIP header is limited to 1024 bytes.\n\nHow this data is presented in the SIP REFER message also depends on the value of transfer_headers_send_method(as defined in [Generic Service Desk SIP Parameters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actionsgeneric-service-desk-sip-parameters)).\n\nThe following example shows the data included as headers:\n\nREFER sip:b@atlanta.example.com SIP/2.0\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP agenta.atlanta.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK2293940223\nTo: <sip:b@atlanta.example.com>\nFrom: <sip:a@atlanta.example.com>;tag=193402342\nCall-ID: 898234234@agenta.atlanta.example.com\nCSeq: 23 REFER\nMax-Forwards: 7\nRefer-To: sip:user@domain.com", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-phone-actions"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03158-7739-9484", "score": 15.523243, "text": "\n[checkmark icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/phone-checkmark-save.png) to save each number.\n* To import a set of phone numbers that are stored in a comma-separated values (CSV) file, click the Upload a CSV file icon (![Add phone number](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/phone-integ-import-number.png)), and then find the CSV file that contains the list of phone numbers.\n\nThe phone numbers you upload will replace any existing numbers in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Advanced configuration options \n\nClick the Advanced options tab to make any of the following customizations to the call behavior:\n\n\n\n Handle call and transfer failures \n\nYou can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason.

A credential might contain a user name, password, host name, port, and a URL.\n\nHowever, while the contents of each credential is unique to the service that generates it, all services managed by IAM require that new credentials include an IAM Service access role. Some services might generate more data that requires parameters to be passed in. For example, a service might require you to input a language parameter to set the default language that is returned in the resource key that is generated.\n\nTo create a resource key, call the [Resource Controller API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controllercreate-resource-key) as shown in the following example:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Python\n* Go\n* Node", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02196-14110-15777", "score": 16.947914, "text": "\nTo view the credential, the user must have the IAM level access action resource-controller.credential.retrieve_all.

However, all users must have the correct level of access to see the details of a credential including the API key value. The access of the user must be equal to or greater than that of the service credential.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16636-0-1664", "score": 18.959316, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Integrating Presto with Apache Hudi using a Hudi connector \n\nYou can integrate Presto with Apache Hudi by using the Hudi connector.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13738-1764-3816", "score": 14.375487, "text": "\nThe features include such attributes as part of speech, lexical stress, word-level prominence, and positional features such as the position of the syllable or word in the sentence.\n\nThe DNNs are trained on natural human speech to predict the acoustic features of the audio.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}]}

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "score": 17.704947, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11873-1269-2814", "score": 17.687073, "text": "\n* If you want to use a private repository, you must [create a secret](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-satcon-manage-gitopscreate-satconfig-private-secret) on the target cluster that contains a personal access token with at least read access to your private repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a secret for using a private repository \n\nTo connect to private repositories, you must create and apply a git personal access token to your clusters.\n\n\n\n1.

We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users.

The section [using Terraform modules with blueprint templates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-blueprint-terraform) illustrates how public modules can be combined with user developed modules to create custom solutions.\n\nWell designed templates are reusable across multiple environments, with the customizable input values maintained separately from the template as [inputs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-termsbpi1). In cookie cutter fashion, several environments can be created from the same blueprint template. Each environment has its own [blueprint configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-sch-termsbpb3) and inputs. This separation of template from its deploy time configuration is illustrated in the figure. Here a template is reused many times to deploy a range of environments such as dev, stage, and production.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-blueprint-templates&interface=ui"}]}

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key.

The list starts with the most fundamental concepts.\n\n\n\n Hardware security module \n\nA hardware security module (HSM) is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing. HSMs of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services are FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified, which is the highest level of security for cryptographic hardware. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Crypto units \n\nA crypto unit is a single unit that represents an HSM and the corresponding software stack that is dedicated to the HSM for cryptography. In Hyper Protect Crypto Services, the following types of crypto unit are available:\n\n\n\n* Operational crypto unit", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13108-7-2001", "score": 16.453842, "text": "\nAbout Key Protect \n\nIBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae is a full-service encryption solution that allows data to be secured and stored in IBM Cloud using the latest envelope encryption techniques that leverage FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified cloud-based hardware security modules.\n\nSensitive data should not be stored on any cloud provider unencrypted (as \"plaintext\", in other words). But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07982-7-2122", "score": 16.379524, "text": "\nHandling and securing secrets \n\nA secret is any piece of data that is sensitive within the context of an application or service.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05681-2673-4668", "score": 15.28234, "text": "\n* The vpc provider is designed to support multiple VPC subproviders.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07986-7-1973", "score": 14.259517, "text": "\nVPC reference architecture for IBM Cloud for Financial Services \n\n[IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpcabout-vpc) is a public cloud offering that lets an enterprise establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure.

This requirement is necessary for \"High Availability\" (HA). It means that you provide the best possible continuous data availability after a hardware failure. Different HA techniques tolerate different levels of failure before operations are affected.\n\nYou might want to have quick and easy ways of backing up and restoring data. For example, after a severe or extensive hardware failure, you want the ability to make all the data available on an alternative system as quickly as possible. This requirement is necessary for \"Disaster Recovery\" (DR). A disaster generally means that a database is no longer available in one or more locations. For example, a power outage might cause all systems in a database cluster to fail. Or a large-scale network failure might mean systems in a cluster can't be contacted, even though they continue to work correctly.\n\nAddressing your HA or DR requirements often begins by simplifying the problem into more generic requirements. When you identify your requirements, you can apply the tools and features that help solve the generic needs. Together, the tools and features can address your HA or DR requirements.\n\nDifferent tools and features provide different levels of protection.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

You can use the /dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the /dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides. See [Downloading a skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02900-4643-6783", "score": 16.650013, "text": "\n* a digression that starts elsewhere and enters the node must return to the interrupted dialog flow after the current dialog flow is completed\n\n\n\nTo change the digression behavior for an individual node, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Click Customize, and then click the Digressions tab.\n\nThe configuration options differ depending on whether the node you are editing is a root node, a child node, a node with children, or a node with slots.\n\n\n\n Digressions away from this node \n\nIf the circumstances listed earlier do not apply, then you can make the following choices:\n\n\n\n* All node types: Choose whether to allow users to digress away from the current node before they reach the end of the current dialog branch.\n* All nodes that have children: Choose whether you want the conversation to come back to the current node after a digression if the current node's response has already been displayed and its child nodes are incidental to the node's goal. Set the Allow return from digressions triggered after this node's response toggle to No to prevent the dialog from returning to the current node and continuing to process its branch.\n\nFor example, if the user asks, Do you sell cupcakes? and the response, We offer cupcakes in a variety of flavors and sizes is displayed before the user changes subjects, you might not want the dialog to return to where it was. Especially, if the child nodes only address possible follow-up questions from the user and can safely be ignored.\n\nHowever, if the node relies on its child nodes to address the question, then you might want to force the conversation to return and continue processing the nodes in the current branch. For example, the initial response might be, We offer cupcakes in all shapes and sizes. Which menu do you want to see: gluten-free, dairy-free, or regular? If the user changes subjects at this point, you might want the dialog to return so the user can pick a menu type and get the information they wanted.\n* Nodes with slots: Choose whether you want to allow users to digress away from the node before all of the slots are filled.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime"}]}

Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input.

For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response. You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "score": 14.30505, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support.

Curation adds value to data; it transforms data into trusted information and knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n Ground truth generation \n\nThis stage refers to the use of Knowledge Studio tools and best practices to produce a collection of vetted data that can be used to adapt a Watson solution to a particular domain. The accuracy of this vetted data, called ground truth or gold standard documents, is critical because inaccuracies in the ground truth will correlate to inaccuracies in the applications that rely on it.\n\nAn essential part of teaching Watson about a new domain involves providing it with knowledge about entities of interest in your domain content, the relationships between them, and how the entities co-reference each other. Collecting this knowledge includes the following activities:\n\n\n\n* Involving domain subject matter experts to create the following resources, or to identify existing resources that can be re-used or modified for your domain:\n\n\n\n* Annotation guidelines and examples to help human annotators learn how words and passages in your domain content are to be annotated.\n* Type systems that define the domain-specific types (objects) and features (data classifications) that can be discovered in your domain content through text analysis.

They are not used by the machine learning model. The model uses only the relation type and order, and ignores the relation attributes.\n5. Use the Edit and Delete icons to modify entity types and their associated relation types, or to delete an entity type or relation type from the type system.\n\nIf you delete an entity that is used in a relation type definition, the relation type definition is also deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated tasks:\n\n[Modifying a type system without losing human annotations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-improve-mlwks_projtypesysmod)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Type system creation guidelines \n\nThe purpose of any type system in Knowledge Studio is to define how spans of text can be annotated.

Do not cover things that are not needed. Do not split types or make distinctions that are not needed by the application. For example, if the source document contains the sentence Murder on the Orient Express made headlines, then how you define entity types to capture the key information in the sentence differs depending on the type of application that will use the model that you build with the type system.\n\n\n\n* For a literary application, you might create types that capture this information:\n\n[NOVEL] [CRITICAL_RECEPTION]\n\n[Murder on the Orient Express] [made headlines]\n* For a public safety application, you might create these types:\n\n[EVENT_CRIME] [LOCATION]\n\n[Murder] on the [Orient Express] made headlines", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-typesystem"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16447-1597-3270", "score": 15.133554, "text": "\nIn large team settings, admins rarely participate in the model development process. \n Project manager Responsible for the overall organization of the workspace that she or he is assigned to.

Discovery treats the user input as a search query. It finds information that is relevant to the query from a configured data source and returns it to the assistant.\n\nAdd a search skill to your assistant to prevent the assistant from having to say things like, I'm sorry. I can't help you with that. Instead, the assistant can query existing company documents or data to see whether any useful information can be found and shared with the customer.\n\n![Shows a search result in the preview link integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/search-skill-preview-link.png)\n\nYou must have Discovery for IBM Cloud Pak for Data installed and an instance provisioned before you can complete this procedure to create a search skill.

To read more about Discovery, see the [product documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-about).\n\nTypically, the type of data collection you add to Discovery and access from your assistant contains information that is owned by your company.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-search-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03054-16734-18944", "score": 13.441747, "text": "\nSome web page content is dynamically generated and therefore cannot be crawled.\n\n\n\n* Configuring search results for uploaded documents: If you are using a collection of uploaded documents and cannot get the correct search results or the results are not concise enough, consider using Smart Document Understanding when you create the data collection.\n\nThis feature enables you to annotate documents based on text formatting. For example, you can teach Discovery that any text in 28-point bold font is a document title. If you apply this information to the collection when you ingest it, you can later use the title field as the source for the title section of your search result.\n\nYou can also use Smart Document Understanding to split up large documents into segments that are easier to search. For more information, see the the [Configuring your collection with Smart Document Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-configuring-fields) topic in the Discovery documentation.\n* Improve search results: If you don't like the results you are seeing, review this information for help.\n\n\n\n* Call the search skill from a dialog node, and specify filter details.\n\n\n\nFrom a dialog node search skill response, you can specify a full Discovery query syntax filter to help narrow the results.\n\nFor example, you can define a filter that filters out any documents in the data collection that do not mention an intent in the document title or some other metadata field. Or the filter can filter out documents that do not identify an entity as a known entity in the data collection's metadata or that don't mention the entity anywhere in the full text of the document.

They created clusters for a Development environment that allow worldwide Developers to collaboratively deploy app improvements quickly.\n\nSecurity first: The Development Exec chose bare metal to host the research clusters. With bare metal for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, the sensitive research workloads now have familiar isolation but within the flexibility of public cloud.

For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05998-3108-5122", "score": 18.728806, "text": "\nKubernetes resources include services, deployments, and pods.

For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like kube-system or ibm-system.

With IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service in multiple regions, their analysis apps can be containerized and deployed across the globe, improving availability and addressing local regulations. Those deployments are accelerated with familiar open source tools, already part of IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nThey started by containerizing the analysis apps and putting them in the cloud. In a flash, their hardware headaches went away. They were able to easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their high-performance CPU, RAM, storage, and security needs. And when their analysis apps change, they can add or shrink compute without huge hardware investments. With the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06968-15099-17180", "score": 17.843657, "text": "\n[checkmark icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/icons/checkmark-icon.svg) \n\n\n\n\n\n* PDF files that are secured with a password or certificate are not supported.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly. Deleting an IBM Cloudant document leaves a tombstone document behind, so don't rely on deleting documents to recover disk space. Instead, you must rely on deleting whole databases.\n\nJSON doesn't offer a native way to store dates or timestamps.

Design documents are JSON documents that include the instructions about how the view or index is to be built. Let's take a simple example.

BLOBs can be stored as attachments associated with documents.\n\nMore information about JSON can be found in the [JSON Guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-json-works).\n\n\n\n\n\n Distributed systems \n\nBy using IBM Cloudant's API, you can interact with a collaboration of numerous machines, called a cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00500-14708-16372", "score": 17.644396, "text": "\nWe limit documents to a maximum size of 64 MB.\n\n\n\n\n\n No JavaScript reducers when options.partitioned is true \n\nDesign documents with options.partitioned set to true can't contain JavaScript reduce functions, only built-ins Erlang reducers such as _stats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Storing the view definition \n\nEach view is a JavaScript function.

To add an order, I create a new order document in the database, which cannot generate conflicts.\n\nTo be able to retrieve all orders for a specific customer, we can employ a view, which we cover later.\n\nAvoid constructs that rely on updates to parts of existing documents, where possible. Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00576-8941-10714", "score": 25.032408, "text": "\nThe maximum document size is 1 MB, but documents must be much smaller than that size, typically a few KB.\n\nFor more information, see the following blog posts:\n\n\n\n* [Optimal IBM Cloudant Indexing](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/05/10/Optimal-Cloudant-Indexing.html)\n* [Time-series Data Storage](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/04/08/Time-series-data-storage.html)\n* [Partitioned databases - data design](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/03/05/Partition-Databases-Data-Design.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Making the most of the primary index \n\nIBM Cloudant has a primary index on the document's _id attribute. This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12904-22084-23929", "score": 24.8979, "text": "\nAs the result, you're billed an overage charge based on 87 GB x 12 hours = 1044 GB hours for that extra space.\n\nOverage is calculated by using the maximum number of GB more than the plan allocation during a particular hour within the billing cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disk overage example \n\nAssume that you start a month of 30 days with a Standard plan service instance that uses 9 GB of storage.

From hour 03:00 of day 3, and for the rest of the month, your instance was 8 GB more than the plan allocation.\n\nTherefore, from hour 02:00 of day 3, your bill includes an overage based on 88 GB x 1 hour = 88 GB hours.\n\nFrom hour 03:00 of day 3 to the end of day 3, your bill includes an overage based on 8 GB x 21 hours = 168 GB hours.\n\nFrom hour 00:00 of day 4 until the end of the month (of 30 days), your bill includes an overage.

Catalog syntax is compatible with Hive metastore syntax. See how to [work with the catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogusage) and refer to the [Catalog management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterHiveCatalog) section of the SQL reference.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\nYou can explore, change, or discover structured data on [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/getting-started.htmlgetting-started-console) with Data Engine by using SQL syntax. To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-1659-3917", "score": 24.168016, "text": "\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

There are different types of disaster recovery testing that you can do to verify your resiliency capabilities:\n\n\n\n* DR dry test\n* DR simulation\n* Switch-over\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery dry test \n\nA DR dry test is performed by checking all of the resource availability and runbooks on paper, without running a real DR simulation or switch-over.\n\nThis type of testing is normally run with higher frequency compared to the other testing flavors as no real activities are performed, but it does require the same effort in terms of skills and people.\n\nThe adoption of a recovery orchestrator software improves the whole dry testing process and reduces the time and effort to be run because most of the operations are performed by the software itself. This also increases the preparedness checking of a real DR simulation or switch-over by periodic scanning that all of the components of the DR solutions are in place and works as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery simulation \n\nDR simulation is a way to verify or audit the emergency runbooks and check the\n\nrecovery time objectives(RTO) andrecovery point objectives(RPO) provided by the solution by simulating as much as possible in the same conditions as a real emergency.\n\nThis means introducing disruptions on replication network connections before interrupting the communications among the sites, hence simulating the sudden loss of the primary site.\n\nYou can do this only if your data replication solution is resilient and not providing impact on the production, which continues on the primary site. If this is not the case, then look at the documentation for [plan and design for the worst conditions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-drworst-conditions).\n\nDR simulation deploys a duplicate of your production environment on the DR site that you can use to perform validation and checking. This environment is cleaned at the end of the simulation and updates that happened to the DR test environment are discarded, as the real production has continued on the primary site.\n\nIt is important thus that network streams flowing to the DR test environment are copies of the real production environment.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-dr-testing"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07502-3631-6171", "score": 18.28716, "text": "\nIn all cases, after the infrastructure is available, data is then restored from backup before activating the passive deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n Activating the alternative region \n\nShould a regional outage occur, an alternative region can be activated following pre-established and tested procedures. These procedures can include deploying infrastructure in the region by using project configurations that were created and tested in advance so that error free deployments can readily be accomplished. If pre-existing projects are not maintained, project configurations can be restored from backup and modified to target the alternative region.\n\nPlatform services such as enterprise accounts, accounts, IAM, and catalog are global and thus are not affected by regional outages. The enterprise account hierarchy, private catalogs, and all IAM configuration can continue to be used unchanged during a disaster recovery process. Regional service instances that include networking, VPC, various compute, storage, and databases must be recovered in the new region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Backups \n\nBackups must be stored in a different region from the workload, and ideally in a separate backup account. This separation in location and management domain (account) minimizes the chances that an outage, operational error, or security breach that affect the workload will also affect the backup. Backup regions should be multi-zone IBM Cloud regions or highly available Satellite regions. However, each family of services on IBM Cloud has its own backup mechanism that introduces some limitations that impact this overall strategy. For more information, see [service considerations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/enterprise-account-architecture?topic=enterprise-account-architecture-bcdrservice-considerations).\n\nIn addition, a \"disaster recovery kit\" should be developed and stored outside of IBM Cloud. The disaster recovery kit is an off-site and protected repository that includes hardware, software, and system secure configurations, one-time keys, and the disaster recovery plan. Use this disaster recovery kit during an incident response to restore services.\n\n\n\n Infrastructure as code \n\nInfrastructure as code ensures that good backup practices are implemented in a uniform way across the organization.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server. This capability allows you to decentralize the management of a large domain (such as ibm.com).\n\nA custom domain name server allows you to utilize the DNS provider's servers with the customized reference name of your own domain. For example, you can define your name server to be ns1.cloud.ibm.com instead of ns1.acme.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally 'sign' DNS data so you can be assured it is valid. To eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).\n\n\n\n\n\n Root record CNAME flattening \n\nIBM CIS supports a feature called \"CNAME Flattening.\" Using this method, root records can overcome the IETF RFC restriction that if a root record is a CNAME, it cannot have any other records for that domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-dns-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04334-34286-35758", "score": 20.393753, "text": "\nExport BIND config.\n\nibmcloud cis dns-records-export DNS_DOMAIN_ID [--file FILE] [-i, --instance INSTANCE]\n\n\n\n Command options \n\nDNS_DOMAIN_ID\n: The ID of DNS domain.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server.

It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks or challenges visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a nonstandard user agent. This tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again. This challenge is based on the visitor's IP, and therefore does not apply to challenges presented by WAF rules because they are based on an action that the user performs on your site.\n* Security level - Sets the security level of your website to determine which visitors receive a challenge page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13915-3198-5235", "score": 19.25963, "text": "\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 1 action drop\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 1 source address network-group1\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 action drop\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 destination port 23\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 log\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 protocol tcp\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 source address network-group2\n\nIn the ruleset, ALLOW_LEGACY, there are two rules defined.

For example, DNS resolver services are running on 10.0.80.11 and 10.0.80.12. Other subnets are used during provisioning and support. You can find the IP ranges used in the data centers in [this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).\n\nYou can allow data center access by placing the proper SERVICE-ALLOW rules at the beginning of the firewall rule sets with an action of accept. Where the rule set must be applied depends on the routing and firewall design being implemented.\n\nIt is recommended that you place the firewall rules in the location which causes the least duplication of work. For example, allowing backend subnets inbound on dp0bond0 would be less work than allowing backend subnets outbound toward each VLAN virtual interface.\n\n\n\n Per-interface firewall rules \n\nOne method for configuring the firewall on a VRA is to apply firewall rule sets to each interface. In this case an interface can be a dataplane interface (dp0s0) or a virtual interface (dp0bond0.303).

The initial volume and network bandwidth allocation depends on the [instance profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles) and the bandwidth ratio that you selected for your instance.\n\nThe allocation of the instance's total bandwidth can be adjusted, balancing between network bandwidth and volume bandwidth. If you do not specify the initial volume and network bandwidth allocation, then 25% of total instance bandwidth is allocated to volume bandwidth and 75% is allocated to network bandwidth.\n\nThe maximum volume bandwidth is the highest potential bandwidth that can be allocated to the volume when it is attached to an instance. In cases where the total maximum bandwidth of attached volumes exceeds the amount that is available on the instance, the bandwidth for each volume attachment is set proportionally. The bandwidth is allocated based on the corresponding volume's maximum bandwidth.\n\nThe volume bandwidth available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes.\n\nFor more information, see [Bandwidth allocation for instance profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bandwidth-allocation-profiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n How block size affects performance \n\nIOPS value is based on a 16 KB block size (for all the tiers) with a 50-50 read/write random workload. Each 16 KB of data read/written counts as one read/write operation; a single write of less than 16 KB counts as a single write operation.\n\nBaseline throughput is determined by the number of IOPS multiplied by the throughput multiplier. The throughput multiplier is 16 KB for 3 IOPS/GB or 5 IOPS/GB tiers, or 256 KB for 10 IOPS/GB or custom IOPS tiers. The higher the IOPS that you specify, the higher the throughput. Maximum throughput is 1024 MBps.\n\nThe application I/O size directly impacts storage performance. If the application I/O size is smaller than the throughput multiplier that is used by the profile to calculate the volume\u2019s bandwidth limit, the IOPS limit is reached before the throughput limit.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-capacity-performance&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01232-4496-6574", "score": 18.027256, "text": "\nWhen the volume is canceled, the request is followed by a 24-hour reclaim wait period.

When the reclaim period expires, the data is destroyed and the volume is removed from the console, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Measuring IOPS \n\nIOPS is measured based on a load profile of 16-KB blocks with random 50 percent reads and 50 percent writes. Workloads that differ from this profile might experience poor performance. To improve performance, you can try adjusting the host settings or [enabling Jumbo frames](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-jumboframes).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I use a smaller block size for measuring performance? \n\nMaximum IOPS can be obtained even if you use smaller block sizes. However, the throughput is less in this case. For example, a volume with 6000 IOPS has the following throughput at various block sizes:\n\n\n\n* 16 KB * 6000 IOPS == 93.75 MB/sec\n* 8 KB * 6000 IOPS == 46.88 MB/sec\n* 4 KB * 6000 IOPS == 23.44 MB/sec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Is the allocated IOPS enforced by instance or by volume? \n\nIOPS is enforced at the volume level. Said differently, two hosts connected to a volume with 6000 IOPS share that 6000 IOPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the volume need to be pre-warmed to achieve expected throughput? \n\nPre-warming is not needed. You can observe the specified throughput immediately upon provisioning the volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can more throughput be achieved if a faster Ethernet connection is used? \n\nThroughput limits are set at a per-volume level. That limit cannot be increased by using a faster Ethernet connection. However, with a slower Ethernet connection, your bandwidth can be a potential bottleneck.\n\n\n\n\n\n Do firewalls and security groups impact performance? \n\nIt's best to run storage traffic on a VLAN, which bypasses the firewall.

The maximum bandwidth capacity is determined by the instance profile that you select during instance provisioning.

You can also analyze statistics that are presented in a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix helps you compare the annotations added by the machine learning model to the annotations in ground truth.\n\nThe model statistics provide the following metrics:\n\n\n\n* F1 score\n\nA measurement that considers both precision and recall to compute the score. The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall values, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst value at 0. See [Analyzing low F1 scores](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-mlevaluate-mllowf1).\n* Precision\n\nA measurement that specifies what fraction of the machine learning model's output was accurate when compared to the human annotator output. Precision is determined by the number of correctly labeled annotations divided by the total number of annotations added by the machine learning model. A precision score of 1.0 for entity type A means that every mention that was labeled as entity type A does indeed belong to that classification. A low precision score helps you identify places where the machine learning model created incorrect annotations. The score says nothing about how many other mentions that were labeled as entity type A by the human annotator were missed by the machine learning model; the recall score reflects that information. See [Analyzing low precision scores](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-mlevaluate-mllowp).\n* Recall\n\nA measurement that specifies how many mentions that should have been annotated by a given label were actually annotated with that label - the right mentions being those that human annotators identified in the same documents.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-evaluate-ml"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07033-26461-28860", "score": 7.7285466, "text": "\nFor example, you might change the split ratio to 60%-33%-7%.\nIBM Cloud Pak for Data\n\nIncrease the capacity of your deployed service instance by scaling up service pods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Evaluating the extractor \n\nTo review metrics from the test run of the entity extractor model that you created, click the Evalute extractor tab.\n\nThe following table describes the available evaluation metrics.\n\n\n\nMetrics details\n\n Metric Description \n\n Confusion matrix A table that provides a detailed numeric breakdown of annotated document sets.

Overall scores are lower if the model doesn't have enough training data to learn from. \n Precision Measures how many of the overall extracted mentions are classified as the correct entity type. A false positive is when an entity label is incorrect, but was predicted to be correct (Predicted = Positive, Actual = Negative). False positives typically mean low precision. \n Recall Measures how often entity type mentions that should be extracted are extracted.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API. The core network services that are offered by NSX are:\n\n\n\n Logical switches \n\nA cloud deployment or a virtual data center might have various applications across multiple tenants.

If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 / 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance. Service availability is defined within the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Service Description](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/pdf/6605-17/$file/i126-6605-17_06-2019_en_US.pdf).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the data center have an impact on performance and reliability of a virtual server? \n\nNo, all of the data centers are of the same quality. For best availability, follow the hints in question [How do I provide my applications in high availability?]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14480-2803-4773", "score": 15.12374, "text": "\nService Router Provides gateway services<br><br><br><br> * NAT<br> * Load Balancer<br> * Gateway firewall<br> * North-south routing<br> * VPN<br> * DNS Forwarding<br> * DHCP<br><br><br> \n\n\n\nSome key NSX-T concepts do not correspond to NSX-V functions. You need to review the following concepts so you can understand the NSX-T design implementation.\n\n\n\n* A gateway cluster is one or more VMs or physical machines that participate in an NSX-T virtual fabric. They are endpoints for the overlay network transport zones and VLAN backed transport zones. A gateway cluster can support a single T0 gateway instance.\n* A T0 gateway is a virtual router instance, but not a VM. Multiple T0 gateway instances can run within a gateway cluster each with its own routing table and functions. A gateway cluster must exist before you can create a T0 router instance.\n* A transport zone can span endpoints across different platforms and multiple vSphere vCenter instances. No cross-vCenter linked NSX is required. Transport zones can be excluded from specific endpoints.\n* Uplink failover order is created independent of a particular logical switch as they are created in profiles as \u201cUplink Profiles\u201d and are applied to a particular logical switch based on VLAN.

With IBM Cloud VPC, you can provision VNF devices to gain better and more affordable scalability than you would by purchasing physical network devices.\n\nTraffic destined for servers in IBM Cloud VPC must be delivered to healthy VNF devices; otherwise, traffic disruption occurs. You can use network load balancers with routing mode to perform health checks and to ensure that workloads only travel through healthy VNF devices. Because of this, network load balancers with routing mode support only VNF devices as back-end targets.\n\nFor detailed examples of various ways you can deploy your NLB with routing mode, refer to [HA VNF deployments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha&interface=ui).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites for NLB with routing mode \n\nTo support routing mode, you must first create a service-to-service authentication policy for your NLB.

All compute resources of the load balancer are actively involved in forwarding traffic.\n\nHigh Availability (HA) is achieved by using a Domain Name Service (DNS). The Virtual IP (VIP) of each compute resource is registered to the assigned DNS. If any of the compute resources go down, the other resources continue to forward traffic.\n\nAn NLB is configured in active-standby mode. A single VIP is registered with DNS, and traffic is forwarded through that compute resource. If an active compute resource goes down, the standby takes over and the VIP is transferred to the standby.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-zone support \n\nNetwork load balancers can accept members across all three availability zones, but the NLB itself resides in one specific zone. A zone is identified by the subnet that is selected when a load balancer is created. Cloud Internet Services (CIS) Global Load Balancer or Private DNS can be used with multiple zonal network load balancers for multi-zone availability.\n\nThe application load balancer can also be configured to span multiple zones. The back-end servers can be in any zone within a region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration with private catalogs \n\nIBM Cloud Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer both integrate with private catalogs to centrally manage access to products in the IBM Cloud catalog and your own catalogs. You can customize your private catalogs to allow or disallow load balancer provisioning to specific users in your account.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple.

As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 19.817444, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16334-20193-22029", "score": 18.777273, "text": "\n* \"User is typing\" support: The web chat now supports displaying the \"user is typing\" message for service desks.

You can edit these settings by selecting the channel in an environment, or in Integrations.\n\nIf you make an update to a channel in the draft environment, the same channel in live environment is not affected in the live environment. Similarly, if you make an update to a channel in the live environment, the same channel in draft environment is not affected. If you select a channel from the Integrations page, you are asked to select which environment you are editing.\n\nFor more information about editing your web chat integration, see [Basic web chat configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview).\n\n\n\n\n\n Deleting channels \n\nTo delete a channel, go to the Integrations page and use the overflow menu on the integration:\n\n![GIF of how to delete a channel](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/delete-channel.gif)\n\nIf you deployed your assistant to a channel, then deleting the channel does not remove the assistant from the channel. For example, if you deploy web chat, you paste the JavaScript snippet into the HTML header of your website. Deleting your channel disconnects your content from the customer experience that is shown on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-assistant"}]}

It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-index"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16384-7-2422", "score": 16.210138, "text": "\nWeb chat overview \n\nYou can use the web chat integration to deploy your assistant on your website or embed it as a WebView in your mobile app. The web chat integration provides an easy-to-use chatbot interface that can integrate seamlessly with your site, without requiring the time and effort that would be required to build your own custom user interface.\n\nThe web chat can help your customers start the conversation with common questions or tasks; it can display multimedia and interactive elements such as forms, and it can transfer customers to human agents for more help. A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09118-9294-10691", "score": 16.17924, "text": "\n[Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-gettingStarted) You can use Text to Speech's speech-synthesis capabilities to convert written text into natural-sounding speech.

For example, you might need to migrate data from old instances to new instances or update the credentials that are used for your app if you delete the Cloud Foundry alias. Applications that make a direct call to the API of a service that is migrated need to update the API call to use either an IAM API key or access token.\n\n\n\n1. Open the More actions menu.\n2.

Here are some approaches you can use to address common goals.\n\n\n\n* Returning the user's input: You can capture the exact text uttered by the user and return it in your response. Use the following SpEL expression in a response to repeat the text that the user specified back in the response:\n\nYou said: <? input.text ?>.\n\nIf autocorrection is on, and you want to return the user's original input before it was corrected, you can use <? input.original_text ?>. But, be sure to use a response condition that checks whether the original_text field exists first.\n* Determining the number of words in user input: You can perform any of the supported String methods on the input.text object. For example, you can find out how many words there are in a user utterance by using the following SpEL expression:\n\ninput.text.split(' ').size()\n\nSee [Expression language methods for String](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methodsdialog-methods-strings) to learn about more methods you can use.\n* Dealing with multiple intents: A user enters input that expresses a wish to complete two separate tasks. I want to open a savings account and apply for a credit card. How does the dialog recognize and address both of them?

Stop words are words that are not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content.\n\nIn English, the, is and and are examples of stop words.\n\nThe stop words that you define are filtered out of queries and improve the relevance of natural language query results.\n\nFor example, a company has three tiers of service. The documents in one of the collections pertain to only one tier, the Silver tier. You might want to add \"silver\" to the stop words list because the term doesn't help to distinguish the significance of one document over another, given that all of the documents relate to the Silver service tier. When a customer mentions the Silver tier in a query string, it is ignored. Other terms in the query that are more significant are used to search the data instead. Or maybe the document collection consists of car accident reports only. You might want to add \"car\" to the stop words list to prevent mentions of car in queries from adding noise to the search.\n\nDiscovery applies a list of default stop words for many of the supported languages automatically. These stop words are applied both at indexing time and at query time. The predefined stop words are ignored when content is indexed and they are filtered out of queries. However, stop words that you define are used at query time only. Your list doesn't replace the default list; it augments the default list. You can add stop words, but you cannot remove stop words.\n\nExample custom stop word list:\n\n{\n\"stopwords\": [\n\"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"ibm\", \"what\", \"how\", \"when\", \"can\", \"should\", ...\n]\n}\n\n\n\n Default stop word lists \n\nYou can access the default stop words list for English from the [Watson Developer Cloud GitHub repository](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/doc-tutorial-downloads/tree/master/discovery-data/custom_stopwords_en.json).\n\nFor the following languages, Discovery uses the default stop words list that is defined by Apache Lucene.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-stopwords"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13761-10654-12000", "score": 9.283929, "text": "\nnone \"I am going to give her the <emphasis level='none'>book</emphasis>.\" Your browser does not support the audio tag. \n moderate \"I am going to <emphasis level='moderate'>give</emphasis> her the book.\" Your browser does not support the audio tag. \n strong \"I am going to <emphasis level='strong'>give</emphasis> her the book.\" Your browser does not support the audio tag. \n reduced \"I <emphasis level='reduced'>am going to give</emphasis> her the book.\" Your browser does not support the audio tag. \n\n\n\n\n\n Emphasizing a word with SSML \n\nThe following example HTTP request uses the <emphasis> element with a level of moderate (the default) to emphasize the word give in the sentence.
