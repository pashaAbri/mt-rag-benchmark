The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response.

This index size is good, since index size contributes to storage costs.\n* The index is robust.

Following are the three key concepts in RAID:\n\n\n\n* Mirroring: copying data to more than one disk\n* Striping: splitting data across more than one disk\n* Error correction (fault tolerance): redundant data is stored to allow problems to be detected and possibly fixed.\n\n\n\nAlthough many different levels of RAID exist, IBM chooses to support the most common RAID types: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity / Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05138-7979-9034", "score": 21.25385124092189, "text": "\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}]}

A private load balancer is a load balancer only accessible from within the VPC network and/or where the client has reachability to the VPC network (for example, through Direct Link or Transit Gateway).\n\nFor private load balancers, you must have a dedicated subnet with no custom routes configured for the subnet.\n\nNetwork load balancers with route_mode set to true are private load balancers that support only VNF (virtual network function) devices as back-end targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Load-balancing methods \n\nThree load-balancing methods are available for distributing traffic across back-end application servers: round-robin, weighted round-robin, and least connections.\n\n\n\n Round-robin \n\nRound-robin is the default load-balancing method. With this method, the load balancer forwards incoming client connections in a round-robin fashion to the back-end servers. As a result, all back-end servers receive roughly an equal number of client connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n Weighted round-robin \n\nWith this method, the load balancer forwards incoming client connections to the back-end servers in proportion to the weight assigned to these servers.

You can query a particular document revision by using its _rev in order to obtain a history of revisions to your document. However, a consequence of compaction is that you cannot rely on a successful response.

For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accountsliteaccount).\n* How many apps can I build?\n\nThere's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.\n\nIf you created a Lite account before 12 August 2021, you can build and deploy apps with 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.\n* What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?\n\nReaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.\n\nYou can check your usage by going to Manage > Billing and usage in the IBM Cloud console, and selecting Usage.

Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage. If you store more than 20 GB, you're charged a defined cost per GB per hour.\n\nRefer to the IBM Cloud Pricing Calculator in the dashboard for pricing at different capacities and currencies, and the [pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricingpricing) information for examples to estimate costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dedicated Hardware plan", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public"}]}

Words from a custom model are in competition with words from the service's base vocabulary as well as other words of the model. (Factors such as audio noise and speaker accents also affect the quality of transcription.)\n\nThe accuracy of transcription can depend largely on how words are defined in a model and how speakers say them. To improve the service's accuracy, use corpora to provide as many examples as possible of how OOV words are used in the domain. Repeating the OOV words in corpora can improve the quality of the custom language model. How you duplicate the words in corpora depends on how you expect users to say them in the audio that is to be recognized. The more sentences that you add that represent the context in which speakers use words from the domain, the better the service's recognition accuracy.\n\nThe service does not apply a simple word-matching algorithm. Its transcription depends on the context in which words are used. When it parses a corpus, the service includes information about n-grams (bi-grams, tri-grams, and so on) from the sentences of the corpus in the custom model. This information helps the service transcribe audio with greater accuracy, and it explains why training a custom model on corpora is more valuable than training it on custom words alone.\n\nFor example, accountants adhere to a common set of standards and procedures that are known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). When you create a custom model for a financial domain, provide sentences that use the term GAAP in context. The sentences help the service distinguish between general phrases such as \"the gap between them is small\" and domain-centric phrases such as \"GAAP provides guidelines for measuring and disclosing financial information.\"\n\nIn general, it is better for corpora to use words in different contexts, which can improve how the service learns the words.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-corporaWords"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16628-0-1541", "score": 13.384043532823528, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  About Visual Explain \n\nThe visual explain feature in IBM\u00ae watsonx.data shows the execution plan for a specified SQL query. This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.

By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

This can help you understand how well your application is performing, as well as identify areas that you might need to focus on to improve results. Discovery provides an API that can be embedded in your application to track events. Calling this API with the appropriate information when a user performs an action sends a signal back to Discovery, which can then be viewed in the logs.\n\nEvents can help gather information on computing metrics (like clickthrough rate) to measure how effective the application is at helping end users find relevant information, or can be used to help seed training by reviewing the queries and clicks to start to build ground truth.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-usage"}]}

Unlike Discovery Query Language queries, with natural language queries you cannot specify which fields from the document you care about or how much significance to give to each one. When you teach Discovery with examples, the service figures out for you how much weight to give to each field.\n\nDiscovery builds a model that assigns different weights to term, bigram, and skip-gram matches for each of the root-level fields and balances them against matches from all of the other document fields. With enough examples, Discovery can return better answers because it knows where the best answers are typically stored.\n\nRelevancy training cannot be used to give more weight to nested fields. Nested fields are grouped and assigned one overall score. No matter how much you train, Discovery never gives a nested field more weight than it gives to a root-level field.

In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need.

The possible vulnerabilities are updated daily by using the published security notices for the Docker image types that are listed in the following table. Typically, for a vulnerable package to pass the scan, a later version of the package is required that includes a fix for the vulnerability. The same package can list multiple vulnerabilities, and in this case, a single package update can address multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability Advisor returns vulnerabilities only when a package fix is published by the distributor.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-4-2366", "score": 35.74146097124232, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container.

In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step.

Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Red Hat OpenShift master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).

For this example, the following configuration is available:\n\n50% of 2 * 16 cores * 2.1 GHz = 33.6 GHz available\n\nOther workloads are also present on the ESXi servers, for example, VMware vCenter Server, VMware NSX\u00ae Controller\u2122, and VMware NSX Edge\u2122. Because these resources are used, the third requirement cannot be satisfied because 33.6 GHz of CPU and 32 GB RAM are needed for the two BIG-IP VMs.\n\nIn this case, the F5 BIG-IP installation might fail, unless at least one ESXi server is added to the environment and vSphere HA failover reservations are updated to ensure that enough resources are available for two BIG-IP VE VMs. If more resources are needed to run the F5 BIG-IP service, you can add more ESXi servers before you install F5 BIG-IP.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations when you delete F5 BIG-IP \n\nReview the following considerations before you delete the service:\n\n\n\n* Before you delete the F5 BIG-IP service, ensure that the existing BIG-IP VE configuration is removed correctly. Specifically, network traffic must be routed around BIG-IP VE instead of through BIG-IP VE. Otherwise, the existing data traffic from your environment might be impacted.\n* If you installed the F5 BIG-IP service before VMware Solutions v4.0 and then deleted that service, you must manually remove the DNS entries.

It is critical that resources are still available for them.\n\nTo calculate the CPU and RAM reservation for a single BIG-IP VE VM, use the following formula:\n\nCPU reservation = CPU speed of ESXi server * number of CPUs (from Table 1)\n\nRAM reservation = RAM size (from Table 1)\n* IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions does not preconfigure HA.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs). Access policies and SCCs can help prevent untrusted users from deploying high priority pods that prevent other pods from scheduling.\n\nHow does priority scheduling and preemption work?\n\nIn general, pending pods that have a higher priority are scheduled before lower prioritized pods. If you don't have enough resources remaining in your worker nodes, the Red Hat OpenShift controller can preempt (remove) pods to free up enough resources for the higher prioritized pods to be scheduled.

VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift overview \n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform is a platform that is designed to orchestrate containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network.

You must consider the following before you take a snapshot.\n\nDuring the installation of Red Hat OpenShift 4.x clusters, a bootstrap certificate is created that is used on the control-plane nodes to create certificate signing requests (CSRs) for kubelet client certificates (one for each node or kubelet). This certificate is used to identify each kubelet on any node. Because these certificates cannot be revoked, they are made with a short expiration time of 24 hours after cluster installation. All nodes other than the control-plane nodes have a service account token that is revocable. The bootstrap certificate is valid only for 24 hours after cluster installation. After the initial 24 hours, the certificate expires every 30 days.\n\nThe first control-plane kubelet lasts for 24 hours before it is re-created. If you are taking a snapshot immediately after deployment, the control-plane kubelet does not yet have a 30-day client certificate. Then, the missing kubelet client certificate refresh window renders the cluster unusable, because the bootstrap credential cannot be used when the cluster is back up. Practically, this process requires an Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster to be running for at least 25 hours after installation before it can be shut down.\n\nYou can check the validity of the certificate by running the following command in the bastion host after deployment:\n\nssh -i /.ssh/id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no core@192.168.133.10 -- sudo openssl x509 -text -noout -in /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem\n\nRun the following command to check the lifetime of the certificate of the output.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-openshift-runbook-runbook-trbl-intro"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14492-7270-9227", "score": 26.842144586139792, "text": "\n* If the cluster is not attached to a subscription, a message is displayed with a link that you can use to find this cluster in the Red Hat customer portal.

Please rephrase your question.\n>>\n\nThe assistant is starting out with the correct greeting, but it doesn't understand when you tell it your name. And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13121-7-1979", "score": 18.00272964044874, "text": "\nEnhance cloud security by applying context-based restrictions \n\nThis tutorial may incur costs.

I'll be answering those questions by discussing feature flags, or sometimes referred to as feature toggle, or switches.\n\nFeature flags are conditions that encompass feature code that allow you to flip them on and off at will. Okay, let's use an example. [Draw] Let's say we've got an ice cream shop franchise that's looking to expand to a new city and we've got a [Draw] banner that we want to display on our website.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

Instead, reflecting the different use cases and infrastructure maintenance requirements for Satellite-based deployments, users are charged a flat rate for each location where they want Key Protect installed and then an additional rate depending on the quota of keys they select at deployment time.\n\nBecause of the way Key Protect structures its billing system, you cannot delete the first instance you deploy unless you plan to uninstall Key Protect from your Satellite location completely.\n\n\n\n Details \n\nPricing is for Key Protect on Satellite only and does not include the price of a Satellite location or the price to install IBM Cloud Database (ICD) creation in your location.\n\nPricing for Key Protect on Satellite is based on two metrics:\n\n\n\n* Base price: a monthly base price charged for the installation of Key Protect into a Satellite location. This is $780 a month per location. Note that there is no additional charge for creating multiple instances in a location.\n* Key quota: the maximum number of [non-deleted keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-pricing-plan-satellitepricing-plan-satellite-non-deleted) which is defined when Key Protect is deployed in the Satellite location. This quota covers the number of keys per location, not per instance. If you choose to create a second instance, it is bound by the quota selected for the location. You do not need to increase your quota. Keys cost $1 per key, while quotas can be requested in batches of 100 keys. Because the minimum quota that can be selected is 100, the minimum quota charge is $100. If 200 keys are selected, for example, the charge is $200. This quota of keys can be changed later by opening a service ticket. If you attempt to exceed your key quota, you will get an error.\n\n\n\nIf you change quotas in the middle of a billing cycle (for example, going from 100 keys to 200 keys) you are charged whichever quota is larger.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more.

Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds.

The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request.

If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number.

Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07067-26099-28206", "score": 13.305914496840167, "text": "\nIf false, ranks the passages from all of the documents by passage quality regardless of the document quality and returns them in a separate passages field in the response.\n* When passages are returned for a query, you can also enable answer finding.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings.

Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings.

Next, the slot level Not found conditions are evaluated. And, finally, the root level anything_else node is processed. To better understand the full order of operations for a node with slots, see [Slot usage tips](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slotsdialog-slots-node-level-handler).\n* Strings that begin with a number sign (#) in the context or output objects of a message are no longer treated as intent references.\n\nPreviously, these strings were treated as intents automatically.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"}]}

Or, if you prefer, you can connect the assistant to your existing infrastructure by configuring an existing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk.\n\nA SIP trunk is equivalent to an analog telephone line, except it uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to transmit voice data and can support multiple concurrent calls. The trunk can connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or your company's on-premises private branch exchange (PBX). If you choose to generate a free phone number for your assistant, a SIP trunk is automatically provisioned from IntelePeer. You can also choose to use an existing SIP trunk from a provider such as IntelePeer, Genesys, or Twilio.\n\nGenerating a free phone number is available only with new phone integrations. If you have an existing phone integration and you want to switch to a free phone number, you must delete the existing integration and create a new one.\n\nWhen your customer makes a phone call using the telephone number connected to your assistant, the phone integration answers. The integration converts output from your assistant into voice audio by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service. The audio is sent to the telephone network through the SIP trunk. When the customer replies, the voice input is converted into text by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service.\n\nThis feature is available only to Plus or Enterprise plan users.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phone"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03158-2940-4987", "score": 19.96159851093908, "text": "\nIn the Integrations section on the main page for your assistant, click Add integration.\n2.

One instance of the channel is connected to the draft environment and the other instance is connected to the live environment. If you are using [multiple environments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-multiple-environments), instances of the channel are added to your extra environments. To connect your assistant to a new channel, go to the Integrations catalog. For more information about adding integrations to your assistant, see [Adding integrations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-integration-add).\n\nAlthough a channel always exists in environments, you can configure your integration separately in each environment. For example, this allows you to test integrations on your draft environment before you go live with any integration configuration. After you add an integration, you must set it up to use it with your assistant. The Finish setup icon appears on any integration that you added but didn't yet set up.\n\nYou have multiple options for deploying your assistant, depending on how you want your customers to interact with it. In most cases, an assistant is deployed by using one of the following integrations:\n\n\n\n* [Web chat integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-web-chat): The web chat integration provides a secure and highly customizable widget you can add to your website. You can configure how and where the web chat widget appears, and you can use theming to align it with your branding and website design. If a customer needs help from a person, the web chat integration can transfer the conversation to an agent.\n* [Phone integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone): The phone integration enables your assistant to converse with customers on the phone by using the IBM Watson Text to Speech and Speech to Text services.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-assistant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16288-7-2218", "score": 19.824540110406986, "text": "\nPhone integration configuration \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nAfter you have set up the phone integration for your assistant, you can modify the phone integration settings to customize the call behavior.\n\n\n\n Handling call and transfer failures \n\nYou can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues.

The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07844-3757-5369", "score": 13.397065652550161, "text": "\nRA-5 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (c) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes acceptance tests to validate every deployment<br><br><br>", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07844-2925-4586", "score": 13.30672072310853, "text": "\nRA-5 (a) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br> \n RA-5 (b) <br><br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans build artifacts to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor scans for critical or high vulnerabilities in the system at least every # day(s)<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain validates code against Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker benchmarks to ensure container runtimes are configured securely<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes dynamic code scan to identify vulnerabilities in deployed artifacts<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain scans source code and their dependencies to identify vulnerabilities<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain source code contains no secrets<br> * Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain passes static code scan to identify vulnerabilities in source code<br><br><br>", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-1213887-1215935", "score": 13.263996988244115, "text": "\nAfter you delete your Key Protect instance, Key Protect uses[envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption) to crypto-shred any data that is associated with the Key Protect instance.\n* Why does the user interface show unauthorized access?\n\nSetting and retrieving the network access policy is only supported through the application programming interface (API).

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 27.56998170710024, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 24.03308739625832, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04111-35313-36062", "score": 20.22126061362581, "text": "\nGet Bot Management settings.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04170-1738-2974", "score": 22.866861271023176, "text": "\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

Computers and other machines (such as IoT devices) are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot (or zombie). The attacker controls the group of bots, which is called a botnet.\n\nAfter establishing a botnet, the attacker directs the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot using remote control. A targeted IP address can receive requests from a multitude of bots, causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity. This creates a denial-of-service to normal traffic. Because each bot is a legitimate internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Common types of DDoS attacks \n\nDDoS attack vectors target varying components of a network connection. While nearly all DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target device or network with traffic, attacks can be divided into three categories. An attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 30.017913801806603, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16425-17609-19989", "score": 29.952303132586426, "text": "\nIf the type is unlikely to ever be used in literature from this domain, then remove it from the type system.\n* Two types are often interchanged when human annotators annotate documents.

Knowledge Studio also supports the ability to upload several types of dictionary files.\n\n\n\n How are dictionaries used? \n\nDictionaries are used in a couple ways, all optional. They are used by the machine learning model to provide words or phrases that are equivalent for information-extraction purposes and during pre-annotation to bootstrap the annotation effort.\n\n\n\n* Machine learning usage\n\nThe entity type that you associate with a dictionary is not used to define rules for the machine learning model. Machine learning evaluates mentions in the documents independently. It does not assume that a mention has a specific entity type just because the mention matches an entry in a dictionary that is associated with that entity type. It does take the information into account, but treats it as one piece of information among other pieces of information that it gathers through linguistic analysis. In fact, if none of the terms in a dictionary occur in the ground truth documents, then the dictionary is not used at all by the machine learning model.\n* Pre-annotation usage\n\nDictionaries are important to the following pre-annotatation processes.\n\n\n\n* Dictionary pre-annotator: You associate a dictionary with an entity type from the type system when you run the dictionary pre-annotator.\n* Rule-based model: You can optionally associate a dictionary with a rule class.

Machine learning evaluates mentions in the documents independently. It does not assume that a mention has a specific entity type just because the mention matches an entry in a dictionary that is associated with that entity type. It does take the information into account, but treats it as one piece of information among other pieces of information that it gathers through linguistic analysis. In fact, if none of the terms in a dictionary occur in the ground truth documents, then the dictionary is not used at all by the machine learning model.\n* Pre-annotation usage\n\nDictionaries are important to the following pre-annotatation processes.\n\n\n\n* Dictionary pre-annotator: You associate a dictionary with an entity type from the type system when you run the dictionary pre-annotator.\n* Rule-based model: You can optionally associate a dictionary with a rule class.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 24.68380739384438, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 24.552246579563786, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Unlike IAM policies, context-based restrictions don't assign access. Context-based restrictions check that an access request comes from an allowed context that you configure. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16364-138344-140340", "score": 23.216239429597273, "text": "\nThese URLs do not introduce a breaking change.

The disambiguation feature shows it to customers if the assistant needs to ask them to clarify their meaning. The text you add as the node name must identify the purpose of the node clearly and succinctly, such as Place an order or Get plan information.\n\nIf the External node name field exists and contains a summary of the node's purpose, then its summary is shown in the disambiguation list instead. Otherwise, the dialog node name content is shown.\n\n\n\n* Disambiguation is enabled automatically for all nodes. You can disable it for the entire dialog or for individual dialog nodes.\n* When testing, you might notice that the order of the options in the disambiguation list changes from one test run to the next. Don't worry; this new behavior is intended. As part of work being done to help the assistant learn automatically from user choices, the order of the options in the disambiguation list is being randomized on purpose.

SAP HA for HANA DB instances cluster nodes Primary (Active) and Secondary (Passive)\n\nAt the most basic level, a standard HA HANA cluster in an active-passive configuration has two nodes: one is the primary node and the other is the standby node. This simply means that the primary node is actively serving the active SAP instances (PAS and AAS), while the standby node is waiting to jump in if there is a failure.\n\nThe cluster is set with a virtual hostname IP (hostname is mapped to the FQDN of the HANA ALB through DNS, which is the same as explained previously for SAP ASCS and ERS instances). App instances (PAS and AAS), these are the details to be used on the SAP profiles to call that particular component. The cluster assigns that virtual IP to the active node and uses a heartbeat monitor to confirm the availability of the components. If the primary node stops responding, it triggers the automatic failover mechanism that calls the standby node to step up to become the primary node. The ALB detects the change, redirects the traffic to the new active node, and assigns the virtual IP to it, restoring the component availability. After the failed node is fixed, it comes online as a standby node.\n\n\n\n Synchronous on disk (sync) HANA database replication mechanism supported by SAP", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-automate-sap-ha-deployment-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16670-7352-7811", "score": 13.08625902284866, "text": "\ngosales\".\"order_detail\" AS header\nON details.order_number=header.order_number\nLIMIT 10;\n4.

Pass the explicit master keys, in the following format:\n\nparameter name: \"parquet.encryption.key.list\"\nparameter value: \"<master key ID>:<master key (base64)> , <master key ID>:<master key (base64)>..\"\n\nFor example:\n\nsc.hadoopConfiguration.set(\"parquet.crypto.factory.class\",\"com.ibm.parquet.key.management.IBMKeyToolsFactory\")\nsc.hadoopConfiguration.set(\"parquet.encryption.key.list\" , \"k1:iKwfmI5rDf7HwVBcqeNE6w== , k2:LjxH/aXxMduX6IQcwQgOlw== , k3:rnZHCxhUHr79Y6zvQnxSEQ==\")\n\nThe length of master keys before base64 encoding can be 16, 24 or 32 bytes (128, 192 or 256 bits).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Writing encrypted data \n\nTo write encrypted data:\n\n\n\n1. Specify which columns to encrypted, and which master keys to use:\n\nparameter name: \"parquet.encryption.column.keys\"\nparameter value: \"<master key ID>:<column>,<column>;<master key ID>:<column>,...\"\n2. Specify the footer key:\n\nparameter name: \"parquet.encryption.footer.key\"\nparameter value: \"<master key ID>\"\n\nFor example:\n\ndataFrame.write", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-key-management-application-serverless"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12678-7-2410", "score": 17.805952856679106, "text": "\nKnown issues (Limitations) \n\nUse this topic to find the details of the limitations that are applicable to the Data Security Broker software.\n\n\n\n Application-level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker encryption gives database applications a no-code way to implement application-level encryption. Application-level encryption can be implemented by including a database proxy that intercepts and encrypts sensitive data in accordance with the pre-established data protection policy.\n\nData Security Broker encryption has some restrictions, like any other approaches to the application-level encryption implementation. The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location. Alternatively, you can secure the information with a password, but this reduces security, depending on the level of your password's strength.\n\nAccessibility If your key file is lost, your data is also lost. So, make a backup of your data and your key.\n\nDatabase operations carried out on encrypted versions of the data The information is kept in encrypted form in the database and the database engine and, consequently, the database administrator is never permitted to see the information in form of the plaintext.\n\nMany of today's server and network technologies allow for easier configuration and implementation to minimize the impact on utilization. Implementing encryption of data in transit from endpoint to endpoint both remotely and internally is mandatory in today's cyber risk environment.\n\nThe following are considered equality check operators and are supported:\n\n\n\n* =\n* <>\n* IS NULL\n* IS NOT NULL\n* IN\n* NOT\n* JOIN (all types)\n* GROUP BY", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_limitations"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15105-4-2010", "score": 16.832304549797378, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n* API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating block storage volumes with customer-managed encryption \n\nBy default, Block Storage for VPC boot and data volumes are encrypted with IBM-managed encryption.

With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04734-7-2373", "score": 16.210185733209016, "text": "\nUnderstanding IaaS basics \n\nAs many organizations move to a cloud environment, either on-premises or hosted in data centers, the IT operations administrator's (IT ops admin) role is being redefined.

Use the [Cost Estimator](https://cloud.ibm.com/estimator/review) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.\n\nMultiple deployment environments are common when building a solution. They reflect the lifecycle of a project from development to production. This tutorial introduces tools like the IBM Cloud CLI and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to automate the creation and maintenance of these deployment environments.\n\nDevelopers do not like to write the same thing twice. The [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle is one example of this. Similarly they don't like having to go through tons of clicks in a user interface to setup an environment. Consequently shell scripts have been long used by system administrators and developers to automate repetitive, error-prone and uninteresting tasks.\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Container as a Service (CaaS), Functions as a Service (FaaS) have given developers a high level of abstraction and it became easier to acquire resources like bare metal servers, managed databases, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, etc. But once you have provisioned these resources, you need to connect them together, to configure user access, to update the configuration over time, etc. Being able to automate all these steps and to repeat the installation, configuration under different environments is a must-have these days.\n\nMultiple environments are pretty common in a project to support the different phases of the development cycle with slight differences between the environments like capacity, networking, credentials, log verbosity. In [this other tutorial, we've introduced best practices to organize users, teams and applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-users-teams-applicationsusers-teams-applications) and a sample scenario.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account.

Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09275-37090-39315", "score": 22.141989094693695, "text": "\nThe service includes a threshold for object size and storage period consistent with the intended use of this service: storing cold, inactive data.\n\n[10]: Flex is used for dynamic workloads where access patterns are more difficult to predict. Depending on usage, if the cost of cooler storage that is combined with retrieval charges exceeds a cap value, then the storage charge increases and no any retrieval charges apply. If the data isn't accessed frequently, Flex storage can be more cost effective than Standard storage. If cooler usage patterns become more active, Flex storage is more cost effective than Vault or Cold Vault storage. No threshold object size or storage period applies to Flex buckets.\n\nObjects that are subject to a bucket's Immutable Object Storage retention policy will have expiration actions deferred until the retention policy is no longer enforced.\n\n\n\n\n\n Encrypt data with your own key \n\nBy default, all objects that are stored in COS are encrypted by using randomly generated keys and an all-or-nothing-transform (AONT). When you archive data into your COS instance, your objects are automatically encrypted with data encryption keys (DEKs). When you need to access a bucket, the service checks your user permissions and decrypts the objects within the bucket for you. This encryption model is called provider-managed encryption.\n\nWhile this default encryption model provides at-rest security, some workloads need full control over the data encryption keys used.\n\nCOS provides several options to encrypt your data. This encryption model is called customer-managed encryption:\n\n\n\n* You can manage your keys manually by providing your own encryption keys - referred to as Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).\n* You can choose to use the integration capabilities with IBM Cloud\u00ae Key Management Services like IBM\u00ae Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services.\n\nYou can use IBM\u00ae Key Protect to provision encrypted keys for apps across IBM Cloud services.

Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts.

Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API. For more information, see [Viewing usage in an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Invoicing and payments \n\nUsage in the enterprise is invoiced through the enterprise account.

For these interactions to be verifiable (to ensure, in other words, who is who) requires identities and a system of permissions that can be checked during each interaction. You can think of the kind of identity that is needed as being similar to a credit card in that it identifies someone within a particular context. Credit cards identify an individual in terms of banking transactions, while Fabric identities allow users to be identified in a blockchain context.\n\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, as well as the IBM Blockchain Platform, this component is the Certificate Authority (CA), which creates identities in the form of x509 certificates as well defining of an organization through the creation of a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines the permissions of identities at a component and channel level. These identities can include attributes about them, for example, by linking them to a particular organization or organizational unit (OU).\n\nAn organization MSP, for example, has an MSP subfolder called admins. Any user whose certificate is inside that admin folder is an admin of the organization. Because this MSP defines the organization, it is listed in the configuration on every channel of which the organization is a member. As a result, whenever an admin of the organization tries to perform an action, the signing certificate of the admin (which is attached to all of its interactions) is checked against the certificates listed in the MSP. Does the certificate match the one listed in the channel configuration? If it does, the other organizations will validate it and the action can be performed. If not, the request to execute the transaction is rejected.\n\nIBM Blockchain Platform CAs are based on the [Hyperledger Fabric CA](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/), though it is possible to use another CA if it uses a PKI based on x.509 certificates.

You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities.

In the tool, the name of an entity is always prefixed with the @ character.\n\nYou can train the skill to recognize your entities by providing entity term values and synonyms, entity patterns, or by identifying the context in which an entity is typically used in a sentence.

This section details best practices that contradict adherence to the robustness principle as it is colloquially understood.\n\n\n\n Specificity of validity \n\nThe formal definition and documentation for a service API SHOULD be as explicit as possible about what constitutes valid input.\n\nA client developer shouldn't have to guess at the boundaries of valid input. Armed with explicit knowledge of input validity, developers can write client applications which are more resistant to unexpected failure (and, in this way, are more robust). This specificity also allows quality and security testing to employ [boundary-value analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-value_analysis).\n\nA service implementation SHOULD NOT be liberal in accepting input where the API definition is ambiguous about validity. Instead, the definition SHOULD be updated to remove such ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Input canonicalization \n\nThe formal definition for a service API SHOULD NOT allow a broad range of semantically equivalent inputs without strong justification or mitigation of the inherent problems.\n\nThere are usability benefits to accepting various forms of input.

The additional complexity of transforming noncanonical input makes the service harder to develop and maintain. It also expands the testing and attack surfaces.\n* If canonicalization decisions are tied to specific libraries used by the service, it could be significantly harder to transition a service implementation to a new technology.\n* If canonicalization is done lazily[1], the burden falls on clients to compute equivalency of values.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-robustness"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07765-0-1628", "score": 23.95166653743482, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  IA-5 (4) - Automated Support for Password Strength Determination \n\n\n\n  Control requirements \n\nIA-5 (4) - 0\n:   The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently strong to satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].\n\n\n\n\n\n  IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile \n\nThe rules related to this control that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v1.2.0 profile in [IBM Cloud\u00ae Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\n\n\n*  Check whether App ID advanced password policies are enabled\n*  IBMid employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators satisfy IBMid password requirements\n*  Check whether IBMid password may contain only printable ASCII characters (in the range 33 - 126)\n*  Check whether App ID password strength regex is configured\n*  Check whether IBMid password policy policy contains spaces or any of the following characters: ;:(\"?)<>\n*  Check whether VPN for VPC authentication is configured with a strong pre-shared key with at least # characters\n*  Check whether IBMid password policy requires at least one uppercase letter\n*  Check whether IBMid uses a password meter that coaches users to create strong passwords that exceed the minimum requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  NIST supplemental guidance \n\nThis control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords and the characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the enforcement of which is carried out by organizational information systems in IA-5 (1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ia-5.4"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07787-0-1608", "score": 19.227157600569225, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  MA-4 - Nonlocal Maintenance \n\n\n\n  Control requirements \n\nThe organization:\n\nMA-4 (a)\n:   Approves and monitors nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;\n\nMA-4 (b)\n:   Allows the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the information system;\n\nMA-4 (c)\n:   Employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;\n\nMA-4 (d)\n:   Maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and\n\nMA-4 (e)\n:   Terminates session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n  NIST supplemental guidance \n\nNonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters.

To do so, you can add utterances that you want the assistant to send to the search skill immediately as test utterances in the dialog skill's Try it out pane.

Or you might want to only ever trigger a search for specific user queries that you can identify within the dialog, and use a search skill response type to answer.\n\nTo prevent the search skill from being triggered, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You can optionally include a message that summarizes the user's issue to be provided to the human agent. It is the responsibility of the external service to display a message that is shown to the user that explains that the conversation is being transferred. The dialog does not manage that communication itself. The dialog transfer does not occur when you are testing nodes with this response type in the Try it out pane. You must access a node that uses this response type from a test deployment to see how your users will experience it.\n* Image: Embeds an image into the response. The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options. When a user clicks one of the options, an associated user input value is sent to your assistant. How options are rendered can differ depending on where you deploy the dialog. For example, in one integration channel the options might be displayed as clickable buttons, but in another they might be displayed as a dropdown list.\n* Pause: Forces the application to wait for a specified number of milliseconds before continuing with processing. You can choose to show an indicator that the dialog is working on typing a response. Use this response type if you need to perform an action that might take some time. For example, a parent node makes a Cloud Function call and displays the result in a child node. You could use this response type as the response for the parent node to give the programmatic call time to complete, and then jump to the child node to show the result.

You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. The name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}]}

It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. The name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03369-75826-77957", "score": 20.730016339287506, "text": "\n* Fixed an issue with adding a jump-to from a conditional response in one node to a conditional response in another node.\n* The page now responds better when you scroll horizontally to see multiple levels of child nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15 July 2020 \n\nSupport ended for @sys-location and @sys-person\n: The person and location system entities, which were available as a beta feature in English dialog skills only, are no longer supported. You cannot enable them. If your dialog uses them, they are ignored by the service.\n\nUse contextual entities to teach your skill to recognize the context in which such names are used. For more information about contextual entities, see [Annotation-based method](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entitiesentities-annotations-overview).\n\nFor more information about how to use contextual entites to identify names of people, see the [Detecting Names And Locations With Watson Assistant](https://medium.com/ibm-watson/detecting-names-and-locations-with-watson-assistant-e3e1fa2a8427) blog post on Medium.\n\nHow legacy numeric system entities are processed has changed\n: All new dialog skills use the new system entities automatically.\n\nFor existing skills that use legacy numeric system entities, how the entities are processed now differs based on the skill language.\n\n\n\n* Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese dialog skills that use legacy numeric system entities function the same as before.\n* If you choose to continue to use the legacy system entities in European-language dialog skills, a new legacy API format is used. The new legacy API format simulates the legacy system entities behavior. In particular, it returns a metadata object and does not stop the service from idenfifying multiple system entities for the same input string. In addition, it returns an interpretation object, which was introduced with the new version of system entities. Review the interpretation object to see the useful information that is returned by the new version.\n\n\n\nUpdate your skills to use the new system entities from the Options>System Entities page.\n\nWeb chat security is generally available", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03026-7-2040", "score": 20.293138677713767, "text": "\nDefining what's irrelevant \n\nTeach your dialog skill to recognize when a user asks about topics that it is not designed to answer.\n\nTo teach your assistant about subjects it should ignore, you can review your user conversation logs to mark utterances that discuss off-topic subjects as irrelevant.\n\nIntents that are marked as irrelevant are saved as counterexamples in the JSON workspace, and are included as part of the training data.

By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy /message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another.

When specified in combination with PARTITIONED INTO, the same is done, which is often referred to as clustering the rows by the specified columns into the fixed number of partitions specified by PARTITIONED INTO. When specified without the PARTITIONED clause, it is equivalent to an ORDER BY clause specified at the top level of the SQL SELECT statement. If PARTITIONED INTO is specified, the ORDER BY clause is ignored.\n\n\n\n Partition by columns \n\nWhen you use the PARTITIONED BY (column-list) clause without specifying INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS, you can store the query result by using Hive-style partitioning, which is to create partitions that contain only rows that have certain values for one or more columns. Choose this physical layout if the stored object is further analyzed by using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.\n\nFor example, a result object that contains worldwide order data has a column country to represent the country that the order is initiated from. Partitioning the result object by the column PARTITIONED BY (country), would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.\n\nWhen the result object is stored this way on Cloud Object Storage, each SQL query that contains a predicate, such as country = 'USA' or country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY'), benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during SQL query execution partitions must be read only if they contain data for the countries of interest. This layout tremendously cuts down the I/O traffic of the SQL query.\n\nSee the following extra remarks on Hive-style partitioning.\n\n\n\n* Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme because the column names that are used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, /order/COUNTRY=USA/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet.\n* Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are stored in the object prefix of the partition.

See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it. To test whether your fixes address the issue, you can convert the original file to a PDF file to check for unexpected carriage returns in the text.\n\nAfter applying a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model to a PPT file, table boundaries are not recognized properly\n: During the conversion process, text that is extracted from the table is confused with text that is outside the table in some PPT pages. This issue is more likely to occur in tables with a lot of text and that have footnotes displayed just outside the table border. If you encounter this issue, export the PPT file as a PDF file, and then upload the PDF file instead. Apply a user-trained Smart Document Understanding (SDU) model to the document, and then use the SDU tool to identify the tables in the document.

Its job is to store your application's data securely and make it possible for you to retrieve it quickly and efficiently. IBM Cloudant's key features are shown in the following list:\n\nDatabase\n: Stores and retrieves data. More specifically, it is a JSON document store. JSON comes from JavaScript and represents simple objects in a universal file format.\n\nDocument\n: The unit of storage in IBM Cloudant. Documents are added, updated, and deleted in their entirety.\n\nHTTP API\n: Any IBM Cloudant operation can be achieved by using HTTPS. HTTP is the protocol that powers the World Wide Web and IBM Cloudant is a database that is built for the web. Most databases are hidden in a private network, inaccessible but to a handful of machines. The IBM Cloudant service sits (mainly) on the public internet where it can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection (and permission to do so).\n\nIBM Cloudant wasn't written entirely by IBM.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-5969-7901", "score": 23.21294187921737, "text": "\n}\nShow more\n\nAlternatively, you could produce totals that are grouped by order_id.\n\n\n\n\n\n Example of totals grouped by order_id, with ?group_level=1 \n\n{\n\"rows\":[\n{\n\"key\":\"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"value\":0\n}\n]\n}\n\nSince the view in the previous example returns 0 for the order value, the result indicates that the order is fully paid. The reason is that the positive purchase order total cancels the negative payment amounts. Recording events as separate documents, for example, one for the order and one for each payment, is good practice in IBM Cloudant. This practice avoids the possibility of creating conflicts when multiple processes modify the same document simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding more documents \n\nYou might add other, separate documents to the database to record the following state changes as the order is provisioned and dispatched:\n\n\n\n* Dispatch notifications\n* Delivery receipts\n* Refund records\n\n\n\nAs the data arrives, IBM Cloudant writes to each document separately. Therefore, it's not necessary to modify the core purchase document.\n\n\n\n\n\n Advantages of storing purchase orders in IBM Cloudant \n\nUsing IBM Cloudant to store purchase order information allows an ordering system to be highly available and scalable. With an ordering system like this one, you can deal with large volumes of data and high rates of concurrent access. By modeling the data in separate documents that are only written once, you can ensure that documents never become conflicted, such as during concurrent access to the same document by separate processes.\n\nFurthermore, documents can contain copies of data that exists in other collections to represent - rather than rely on - joining data with a foreign key. For example, IBM Cloudant records the state of a basket at the time of purchase. This record allows an order's state to be fetched by a single call to an IBM Cloudant view that groups documents related by order_id.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00636-1682-3261", "score": 23.212317303604138, "text": "\nFor more information, see the [IAM guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudant) or the legacy [Authentication document](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-accountauthentication). \n Authorization IBM Cloudant supports both legacy and IAM access controls.

An inode is a data structure that contains information about files. Volumes have both private and public inodes. Public inodes are used for files that are visible to the customer and private inodes are used for files that are used internally by the storage system.

Attachments are Binary Large OBject ([BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object)) files that are included within documents.\n\nIt's a good idea to keep attachments small in size and number because attachments can impact performance.\n\nThe BLOB is stored in the _attachments component of the document. The BLOB holds data that includes the following information:\n\n\n\n* The attachment name\n* The type of the attachment\n* The actual content\n\n\n\nExamples of BLOBs would be images and multimedia.\n\nIf you include the attachment as an [inline](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachmentsinline) component of the overall JSON, the attachment content is represented by using BASE64 form.\n\nThe content type corresponds to a [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_typeList_of_common_media_types). For example, if you want to attach a .jpg image file to a document, you specify the attachment MIME type as image/jpeg.\n\nAttachments aren't permitted on documents in [_replicator](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostreplicate) or [_users](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantputsecurity) databases.\n\n\n\n Create or update \n\nTo create a new attachment at the same time as creating a new document, include the attachment as an [inline](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachmentsinline) component of the JSON content.\n\nTo create a new attachment on an existing document, or to update an attachment on a document, make a PUT request with the document's most recent _rev to https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID/$ATTACHMENT.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00564-1452-3164", "score": 21.560734235178973, "text": "\ncouchbackup --url \"$SERVICE_URL\" --db animaldb > backup.txt\n\nThe [NPM readme file](https://github.com/cloudant/couchbackup/blob/master/README.md) details other options, including the ones in this list:\n\n\n\n* Environment variables to set the names of the database and URL.\n* Using a log file to record the progress of a backup.\n* The ability to resume an interrupted backup.\n\nThis option is only available with the log file for the interrupted backup.\n* Sending the backup text file to a named output file, rather than redirecting the stdout output.\n\nThe CouchBackup tools have [limitations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-backup-and-recoverylimitations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Restoring your IBM Cloudant data \n\nTo restore your data, use the couchrestore tool. Use couchrestore to import the backup file into a new IBM Cloudant database. Then, ensure that you build all indexes before any application tries to use the restored data.\n\nFor example, to restore the data that was backed up in the earlier example:\n\ncouchrestore --url \"https://myaccount.cloudant.com\" --db newanimaldb < backup.txt\n\nThe [NPM readme file](https://github.com/cloudant/couchbackup/blob/master/README.md) provides details of other restore options.\n\n\n\n\n\n Limitations \n\nThe CouchBackup tools have the following limitations:\n\n\n\n* _security settings aren't backed up by the tools.\n* Attachments aren't backed up by the tools.\n* Backups aren't precise \"point-in-time\" snapshots. The reason is that the documents in the database are retrieved in batches, but other applications might be updating documents at the same time. Therefore, data in the database can change between the times when the first and last batches are read.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-backup-and-recovery"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00629-29811-31959", "score": 21.41754311413837, "text": "\ncurl \"$SERVICE_URL/$DATABASE/_changes?feed=continuous&include_docs=true&since=now&filter=mydesigndoc/myfilter\"\n\nThe ordering of documents within the _changes feed is not always the same. In other words, changes might not appear in strict time order. The reason is that data is returned from multiple IBM Cloudant nodes, and eventual consistency rules apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication pitfalls \n\nTo replicate successfully, the sum of the document size and all attachment sizes must be less than the maximum request size of the target cluster. For example, if the maximum HTTP request size is 11 MB, then the following scenarios apply:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Various scenarios based on maximum HTTP request size 11 MB\n\n Document size Attachment size Total size Replicates? \n\n 1 MB Five 2-MB attachments 11 MB Yes \n 1 MB One 10-MB attachment 11 MB Yes \n 1 MB One hundred 1-MB attachments 101 MB No \n\n\n\nSeveral considerations apply when you use replication.\n\n\n\n Incorrect user permissions \n\nFor replication to proceed optimally when you replicate from database \"a\" to database \"b\", the credentials that are supplied must have:\n\n\n\n* _reader and _replicator permissions on database \"a\".\n* _writer permissions on database \"b\".\n\n\n\nAPI keys are generated in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard or through the [API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant). Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted. The _replicator document records the current state of the replication process. In an extreme case, the document can become huge because it contains many unresolved conflicts.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-guide"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00620-9537-11012", "score": 21.033001932259317, "text": "\nHowever, in a real application, the page size might be different and depends on document size, latency demands, memory consumption, and other tradeoffs.You can use the options that are described in the following sections.<-- <section \"id=\"section-option-1-fetch-one-doc-too-many\" \"> --> Option 1 - Fetch one document too many Instead of fetching five documents (limit=5), fetch 5+1 (limit=6), but hide the sixth document from your users.

A change that affects a document almost certainly takes place at different times in different copies of the database.\n2. The order in which changes affect documents might differ between different copies of the database, depending on when and from where the replication took place.\n\n\n\nA consequence of the first characteristic is that, when you ask for a list of changes, it is meaningless to ask for a list of changes after a specific point in time. The reason is that the list of changes might be supplied by a different database copy, which resulted in document updates at different times. However, it is meaningful to ask for a list of changes after a specific change, which is specified by using a sequence identifier.\n\nAn extra consequence of the first characteristic is that it might be necessary to \"look back\" at preceding changes to agree on the list of changes. In other words, to get a list of changes, you start from the most recent change that the database copies agree on. The point of agreement between database copies is identified within IBM Cloudant by using the [checkpoint](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-guidecheckpoints) mechanism that enables replication between database copies to be synchronized.\n\nFinally, when you look at a list of changes, they might be presented in a different order in subsequent requests. The order depends on how documents were changed between different database copies. In other words, an initial list of changes might report changes A, B, then C in that order. But a subsequent list of changes might report changes C, A, then B in that order. All the changes are listed, but in a different order.

The provisioned throughput capacity is a reserved number of reads per second, writes per second, and global queries per second allocated to an instance. The throughput capacity setting is the maximum usage level for a given second. You can't exceed the reserved capacity for either reads, writes, or global queries. If you do, an HTTP 429 status code occurs that indicates the application is trying to exceed its provisioned throughput capacity allowance.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

You can verify if a cluster does or does not use a system channel by clicking the cluster's tile and looking near the Orderer Type text.\n\nJoining an orderer to an application channel will make it either a follower or a consenter. It will be a consenter if the node is found in the the channel's config block in the consenters section. Otherwise the orderer will be a follower. Both types of orderers will receive transaction/block data, but only a consenter can vote and play a role in the consensus algorithm.

The following functions are added:\n\n\n\n1. Purge a deleted key: By default, a deleted key becomes purged automatically after 90 days of the deletion. Now you can manually purge a key to permanently remove the key from your instance before 90 days. After a key is deleted, there is a wait period of up to 4 hours before you can perform the action. Make sure that you are assigned the KMS Key Purge role before you purge a key. For more information, see [Purging keys manually](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-purge-keys).\n2. Update the key ring of a key: After you create a key, you can move the key to a different key ring. For more information, see [Transferring a key to a different key ring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-managing-key-ringstransfer-key-key-ring).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30 July 2021 \n\nAdded: Exclusive control on the execution of cryptographic operations\n: To ensure the exclusive control on the execution of cryptographic operations, you can use the Hyper Protect Crypto Services certificate manager CLI to enable the second layer of authentication for EP11 (GREP11 or PKCS #11 API) connections. By enabling this function, you enable an extra layer of access control on top of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) token to the EP11 applications. A mutual TLS connection is established to ensure that only EP11 applications with a valid client certificate can perform EP11 operations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-what-new"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16045-9337-11274", "score": 47.37902315084438, "text": "\nVolume, snapshot, and image resources that are protected by the deleted root key have an unusable status and can't be used for normal operations.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings. For more information, see [Asking clarifying questions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questionsunderstand-questions-ask-clarifying-question).\n* You publish a version of your assistant to the live environment.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-autolearn"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16390-1728-3821", "score": 26.509349103051743, "text": "\nAny action can be shown as a suggestion, unless its Ask clarifying question setting is set to Off.

In the Include a connection to support section, specify when you want an option to connect with support to be included in the list of suggestions.

For example, if you specified a context variable, such as \"color\":\"FFFFFF\", then the hex color code (FFFFFF) would be treated as an intent. Your assistant would check whether an intent named FFFFFF was detected in the user's input, and if not, would replace FFFFFF with false. This replacement no longer occurs.\n\nSimilarly, if you included a number sign (#) in the text string in a node response, you used to have to escape it by preceding it with a back slash (). For example, We are the #1 seller of lobster rolls in Maine. You no longer need to escape the symbol in a text response.\n\nThis change does not apply to node or condtional response conditions. Any strings that begin with a number sign (#) which are specified in conditions continue to be treated as intent references. Also, you can use SpEL expression syntax to force the system to treat a string in the context or output objects of a message as an intent.

In zone-based firewall operation an interface is assigned to a zone (only one zone per interface) and firewall rule sets are assigned to the boundaries between zones with the idea that all interfaces within a zone have the same security level and are allowed to route freely. Traffic is only scrutinized when it is passing from one zone to another. Zones drop any traffic coming into them which is not explicitly allowed.\n\nAn interface can either belong to a zone or have a per-interface firewall configuration; an interface cannot do both.\n\nImagine the following office scenario with three departments, each department with its own VLAN:\n\n\n\n* Department A - VLANs 10 and 20 (interface dp0bond1.10 and dp0bond1.20)\n* Department B - VLANs 30 and 40 (interface dp0bond1.30 and dp0bond1.40)\n* Department C - VLAN 50 (interface dp0bond1.50)\n\n\n\nA zone can be created for each department and the interfaces for that department can be added to the zone.

Because you cannot accept or reject annotation sets until they are in the Submitted status, you might not want to evaluate inter-annotator agreement until all annotation sets are submitted, or you might want to limit your review to only the human annotators who submitted their completed annotation sets.\n\nThe inter-annotator agreement scores show how different human annotators annotated mentions, relations, and coreference chains. You can view the scores by comparing a pair of human annotators (for example, compare all of John's mention annotations to all of Mary's mention annotations). You can also view the scores by comparing specific documents (for example, compare the relation annotations that John made in one document to the relation annotations that Mary made in the same document).\n\nTo help you identify areas that require investigation, scores that fall below the value that you specified for the inter-annotator agreement threshold are highlighted in red. In early stages of your annotation project, you might find that relation scores are often worse than mention scores because a perfect relation annotation requires that the mentions that define the relationship be in agreement first.\n\nThe score in the All column is a Fleiss Kappa score. It represents how consistently the same annotation was applied by multiple human annotators across all overlapping documents in the task.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-build-groundtruth"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16563-12333-14196", "score": 37.20055685974709, "text": "\nThe IAA scores show how different human annotators annotated mentions, relations, and coreference chains. It is a good idea to check IAA scores periodically and verify that human annotators are consistent with each other.\n\nIn this tutorial, the human annotators submitted all the document sets for approval. If the inter-annotator agreement scores are acceptable, you can approve the document sets. If you reject a document set, it is returned to the human annotator for improvement.\n\nFor more information about inter-annotator agreement, see [Building the ground truth](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-build-groundtruth).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

The human annotator annotates the documents in the annotation set. To later use inter-annotator scores to compare the annotations that are added by each human annotator, you must assign at least two human annotators to different annotation sets. You must also specify that some percentage of documents overlap between the sets.\n\nIn a realistic scenario, you create as many annotation sets as needed, based on the number of human annotators who are working in the workspace. In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

Use the syntax, $variable_name:value or $variable_name == 'value'.\n\nFor node conditions, this artifact type is typically used with an AND or OR operator and another condition value. That's because something in the user input must trigger the node; the context variable value being matched alone is not enough to trigger it. If the user input object sets the context variable value somehow, for example, then the node is triggered.\n\nDo not define a node condition based on the value of a context variable in the same dialog node in which you set the context variable value.\n\nFor response conditions, this artifact type can be used alone. You can change the response based on a specific context variable value. For example, $city:Boston checks whether the $city context variable contains the value, Boston. If so, the response is returned.\n\nFor more information about context variables, see [Context variables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-variables).\n* Entity: The node is used when any value or synonym for the entity is recognized in the user input. Use the syntax, @entity_name. For example, @city checks whether any of the city names that are defined for the @city entity were detected in the user input. If so, the node or response is processed.\n\nConsider creating a peer node to handle the case where none of the entity's values or synonyms are recognized.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02914-5621-7418", "score": 16.174430322599832, "text": "\n* [Adding context variables to a node with slots](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-var-slots)\n\n\n\n\n\n Passing context from the application \n\nPass information from the application to the dialog by setting a context variable and passing the context variable to the dialog.\n\nFor example, your application can set a $time_of_day context variable, and pass it to the dialog which can use the information to tailor the greeting it displays to the user.\n\n![Shows a Welcome node that uses response conditions to check for the value of the $time_of_day context variable that is passed to the dialog from the application.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/set-context.png)\n\nIn this example, the dialog knows that the application sets the variable to one of these values: morning, afternoon, or evening. It can check for each value, and depending on which value is present, return the appropriate greeting. If the variable is not passed or has a value that does not match one of the expected values, then a more generic greeting is displayed to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n Passing context from node to node \n\nThe dialog can also add context variables to pass information from one node to another or to update the values of context variables. As the dialog asks for and gets information from the user, it can keep track of the information and reference it later in the conversation.\n\nFor example, in one node you might ask users for their name, and in a later node address them by name.\n\n![Shows an introductions node that asks the user for their name, and stores it as a context variable.

In most cases, you define the context variable as part of the node response. When you do so, the context variable is created and given the specified value when your assistant returns the node response.\n\nFor a node with conditional responses, the context variable is created and set when the condition for a specific response is met and that response is processed. For example, if you define a context variable for conditional response #1 and your assistant processes conditional response #2 only, then the context variable that you defined for conditional response #1 is not created and set.\n\nFor information about where to add context variables that you want your assistant to create and set as a user interacts with a node with slots, see [Adding context variables to a node with slots](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-contextdialog-runtime-context-var-slots).\n\n\n\n\n\n Order of operation \n\nWhen you define multiple variables to be processed together, the order in which you define them does not determine the order in which they are evaluated by your assistant. Your assistant evaluates the variables in random order. Do not set a value in the first context variable in the list and expect to be able to use it in the second variable in the list, because there is no guarantee that the first context variable will be executed before the second one. For example, do not use two context variables to implement logic that checks whether the user input contains the word Yes in it.\n\n\n\nUsing two variables to get a value from user input\n\n Variable Value \n\n user_input <? input.text ?> \n contains_yes <?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime-context"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02934-14695-16614", "score": 15.90657701695416, "text": "\nAs you collect answers from the user per slot, they are saved in context variables.

However, if you use worker node virtual machines, the underlying hardware might be shared with other IBM customers depending on the [level of hardware isolation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-planning_worker_nodesvm) that you choose.\n\nOperating System\n: Worker nodes run on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 operating system.\n\n\n\n* For cluster version 4.10 and later, only RHEL 8 is supported.\n* For cluster version 4.9, you can choose RHEL 7 or RHEL 8, however the default operating system is RHEL 7.\n* For cluster versions 4.8 and earlier, only RHEL 7 is supported.\n\n\n\nCRI-O container runtime\n: Your worker nodes are installed with [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) as the container runtime interface. For more information, see [Container runtime](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-securitycontainer-runtime).\n\nProjects\n: Red Hat OpenShift organizes your resources into projects, which are Kubernetes namespaces with annotations, and includes many more components than community Kubernetes clusters to run Red Hat OpenShift features such as the catalog. Select components of projects are described in the following rows.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16268-7-2150", "score": 16.895636062901577, "text": "\nUsing autolearning to improve assistant responses \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nUse autolearning to enable your assistant to learn from interactions with your customers and improve responses.\n\nWhen customers interact with your assistant, they often make choices. Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings. For more information, see [Asking clarifying questions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questionsunderstand-questions-ask-clarifying-question).\n* You publish a version of your assistant to the live environment.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-autolearn"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16359-6868-8948", "score": 16.88103147319997, "text": "\nAs part of development that is in progress to help the assistant learn automatically from user choices, the actions that are included and their order in the list is randomized on purpose.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16299-7-2120", "score": 13.766922629515216, "text": "\nOverview: Customizing and developing \n\nThe Watson Assistant user interface makes it easy to build an assistant and deploy it to your customers without writing any code.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"></div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using.

It uses a dictionary lookup approach to match a word from the user input to an existing entity value or synonym in the skill's training data. For example, if the user enters boook, and your training data contains a @reading_material entity with a book value, then fuzzy matching recognizes that the two terms (boook and book) mean the same thing.\n\nIn dialog, when you enable both autocorrection and fuzzy matching, the fuzzy matching function runs before autocorrection is triggered.

And thanks to autocorrection revising the term to want, your assistant is able to map the input to your buy_something intent. Each feature does its part to help your assistant understand the meaning of the user input.\n\n\n\n\n\n How autocorrection works \n\nNormally, user input is saved as-is in the text field of the input object of the message. If, and only if the user input is corrected in some way, a new field is created in the input object, called original_text. This field stores the user's original input that includes any misspelled words in it. And the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected.

Therefore, they are only persisted in the browser local storage to allow you to manage the component. If you are using a private browser window and then switch to another browser or non-private browser window, the identities that you created will be gone from your wallet in the new browser session. Therefore, it is required that you export the identities from the wallet in your private browser session to your file system.

These features are available for both the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.\n\nThe features involve the use of elements of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). The descriptions of the features provide information about how they interact with related SSML elements and attributes.\n\n\n\n Using speaking styles \n\nThe expressive neural voices determine the sentiment of the text from the context of its words and phrases. The speech that they produce, in addition to having a very conversational style, reflects the mood of the text. The expressive voices naturally express gratitude, thankfulness, happiness, empathy, confusion, and other sentiments by default, with no explicit additional tagging.\n\nHowever, you can embellish the voices' natural tendencies by using the <express-as> element with the required style attribute to indicate that all or some of the text is to emphasize specific characteristics. These characteristics are referred to as speaking styles:\n\n\n\n* cheerful - Expresses happiness and good news. The style is upbeat, welcoming, and conveys a positive message.\n* empathetic - Expresses empathy and compassion. The style has sympathetic undertones, but it is not excessively sorrowful.\n* neutral - Expresses objectivity and evenness. The style strives for less emotion, and instead conveys a more even and instructional tone.\n* uncertain - Expresses uncertainty and confusion. The style conveys the feeling of being unsure or in doubt.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the effect of the styles is very subtle. In such cases, the differences might not be readily discernible from the default expressive tone. But there are instances where the style can audibly enhance the voices' inherent ability to detect and express emotion. The differences are often detectable only on certain words and phrases.\n\nTable 1 provides examples of each available style for the <express-as> element.

If your application's lexicon includes such words, you can use the customization interface to specify how the service pronounces them.\n\nA custom model is a dictionary of words and their translations.
