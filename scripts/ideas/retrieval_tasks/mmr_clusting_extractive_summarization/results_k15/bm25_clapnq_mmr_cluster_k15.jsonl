The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century , through the experiments of Louis Pasteur , \u00c9mile Roux , and Robert Koch . Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times , first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9 , 1961 -- with a successful recovery .

Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America .

This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) .

Toby also ends up annoying Holly , his replacement , to a degree while showing her around the office and she is somewhat rude to him and claims that he almost bored her to sleep , something which Michael enjoys hearing ( Holly remains oblivious that Michael , in fact , abuses Toby and Michael claims that Toby tortures him ) . Toby faces a cruel exit interview from Michael but the tables are turned when Holly and Pam join the interview . Michael is unable to berate Toby at length as Holly takes over . When she asks Toby ; `` How can Dunder Mifflin be improved ? , '' Toby claims he has a few ideas . Realizing that Toby has a potential opportunity to reveal and complain about his unethical work behavior and abusive treatment , Michael hides his face and angrily glares at Toby , silently threatening to kill him if he answers the question . Toby does not seem afraid but simply gives a `` things are OK as they are '' answer . Toby later tells the camera that he has survived Michael 's abuse long enough and that disclosing it is pointless .", "title": "Toby Flenderson", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "822159927_53398-53559-0-161", "score": 23.691606944943715, "text": "Toby Flenderson\nIn the episode `` Gossip '' Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office , including that Toby is a virgin , even though he has a daughter .", "title": "Toby Flenderson", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "822159927_38530-38909-0-379", "score": 23.28809711127033, "text": "Toby Flenderson\nIn `` Women 's Appreciation , '' Toby is out of the office at a parent - teacher conference when Phyllis is flashed .

In `` Goodbye , Toby '' Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her ( because she took the picture herself ) for when he leaves for Costa Rica . Toby , unsatisfied by the lack of her presence , shouts at the office staff asking for a camera ( possibly the loudest he 's ever spoken ) . When no one responds , he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together .

At the end of the episode , Pam comments ( though not to Toby ) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot . In `` Niagara '' Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding . He is later disappointed when the wedding is called back on but is seen smiling and clapping after they 're married and run down the aisle . During `` Roy 's Wedding '' , while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there 's anything they do n't know about each other , Toby correctly answers facts about Pam . Everyone notices him , and Toby , clearly embarrassed , attempts to cover it up . There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby offered his help and notably in `` Paper Airplane '' after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing ( to which Toby apologizes ) . Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporally blinding Toby .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_45056-45809-0-753", "score": 35.52679754937296, "text": "Guinea pig\nAndean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat , and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

Many more couples , however , experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year : estimates range from 12 % to 28 % . '' 20 - 30 % of infertility cases are due to male infertility , 20 - 35 % are due to female infertility , and 25 - 40 % are due to combined problems in both parts . In 10 - 20 % of cases , no cause is found . The most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory problems which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods . Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_12271-12560-0-289", "score": 33.53517060383666, "text": "Infertility\nGerman scientists have reported that a virus called Adeno - associated virus might have a role in male infertility , though it is otherwise not harmful .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}]}

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure . This view was soon replaced by another that argued , against Polo 's own account , that the Venetian merchant had come to China from the south and so did not come into contact with the Wall .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

Over this period , the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India , importing these from Britain 's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations , while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms , and of agricultural exports from India . Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade . In London , the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India , and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire .

Several economic historians have criticized this argument , such as Prasannan Parthasarathi who pointed to earnings data that show real wages in 18th - century Bengal and Mysore were higher than in Britain . Workers in the textile industry , for example , earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain , while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore .

Over this period , the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India , importing these from Britain 's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations , while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms , and of agricultural exports from India . Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains , such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand and West Bengal , were dedicated to producing poppy and opium , which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China , with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company , and later the colonial British institutions . The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large ; by 1850 , it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains , led to two opium wars in Asia , with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860 . After China accepted opium trade , the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy , the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900 , when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation , opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna , and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong , all under exclusive monopoly of the British . By early 20th century , 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture , famines were common , and food consumption per capita declined in every decade . In London , the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India , and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire .

As the disease advances , uncoordinated , jerky body movements become more apparent .

This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass ( dynamic mutations ) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat . This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations , such that an unaffected parent with an `` intermediate '' number of repeats ( 28 -- 35 ) , or `` reduced penetrance '' ( 36 -- 40 ) , may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD . Such increases in the number of repeats ( and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease ) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation . Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis ; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length , whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length .

He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and furthermore , the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power - hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing . Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' .

Once released , Patel served as interim Congress president , but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Mumbai . After the signing of the Gandhi -- Irwin Pact , Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi -- here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties . It advocated the establishment of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat . Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London , Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened , and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail . During this term of imprisonment , Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other , and the two developed a close bond of affection , trust , and frankness . Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother ( Gandhi ) and his younger brother ( Patel ) . Despite having arguments with Gandhi , Patel respected his instincts and leadership . In prison , the two discussed national and social issues , read Hindu epics , and cracked jokes . Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit . Gandhi 's secretary , Mahadev Desai , kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel . When Gandhi embarked on a fast - unto - death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables , Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced .

Writing that the actress `` quickly stole our hearts as the daddy 's girl and aspiring fashionista , '' Andrew Collins of Radio Times hailed Aniston as a `` natural comic performer , as adept with a subtle nose wrinkle as a full - on pratfall , and fluent in quick - fire patter '' . In 2002 , Aniston won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series . In 2003 , the actress won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series -- Comedy Or Musical . Dominc Willis of TalkTalk believes that Aniston won these awards because of `` her brilliant comic performances in the show .

As a pilot enters a turn , hair cells in the semicircular canals are stimulated , telling the brain that the aircraft , and the pilot , are no longer moving in a straight line but rather making a banked turn . If the pilot were to sustain a constant rate turn , the endolymph would eventually catch up with the ducts and cease to deflect the cupula . The pilot would no longer feel as if the aircraft was in a turn . As the pilot exits the turn , the semicircular canals are stimulated to make the pilot think that they are now turning in the opposite direction rather than flying straight and level . In response to this , the pilot will often lean in the direction of the original turn in an attempt to compensate for this illusion . A more serious form of this is called a graveyard spiral . Rather than the pilot leaning in the direction of the original turn , they may actually reenter the turn .
