A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the `` Father of American Football '' , established the snap , eleven - player teams , and the concept of downs ; later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone , and specified the size and shape of the football .

Second , through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens ( e.g. fasting low - intensity endurance training ) , the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel , sparing carbohydrate use from all sources .

These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after G\u00fcnter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi . Brandt 's contributions to world peace led to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 1971 .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_368-632-0-263","score":0.700232327,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMLS All - Star Game Founded Region Major League Soccer ( CONCACAF ) Number of teams Current champions Real Madrid ( 1st title ) Most successful club ( s ) MLS All - Stars ( 9 times ) Television broadcasters FS1 , UniM\u00e1s , TSN , TVA Sports 2017 MLS All - Star Game","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_7327-7564-0-235","score":0.6903384924,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2007 MLS All - Star Game July 19 , 2007 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 0 Celtic ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado \u00c1ngel 36 ' Toja 44 ' Report Attendance : 18,661 Referee : Baldomero Toledo MVP : Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_10217-10511-0-291","score":0.6824000478,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2017 MLS All - Star Game August 2 , 2017 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 1 ( 2 -- 4 p ) Real Madrid ( show ) Soldier Field , Chicago Dwyer 87 ' Report Mayoral 59 ' Attendance : 61,428 Referee : Allen Chapman MVP : Borja Mayoral Penalties Dwyer Dos Santos Valeri Almir\u00f3n Benzema Bale Kova\u010di\u0107 Marcelo MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_10535-10643-0-108","score":0.6813809276,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2018 MLS All - Star Game August 1 , 2018 MLS All - Stars Juventus ( show ) Mercedes - Benz Stadium , Atlanta","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_9675-9928-0-251","score":0.6789932847,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2015 MLS All - Star Game July 29 , 2015 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 1 Tottenham Hotspur ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado Kak\u00e1 20 ' ( pen . ) Villa 23 ' Report Kane 37 ' Attendance : 18,671 Referee : Ismail Elfath MVP : Kak\u00e1 MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_7094-7305-0-211","score":0.676094532,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2006 MLS All - Star Game August 5 , 2006 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 0 Chelsea ( show ) Toyota Park , Bridgeview , Illinois De Rosario 70 ' Report Attendance : 21,210 Referee : Abbey Okulaja MVP : Dwayne De Rosario MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_9103-9364-0-261","score":0.6744025946,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2013 MLS All - Star Game July 31 , 2013 MLS All - Stars 1 -- 3 Roma ( show ) Sporting Park , Kansas City , Kansas 20 : 30 Gonzalez 90 + 1 ' Report Strootman 4 ' Florenzi 47 ' Tallo 68 ' Attendance : 21,175 Referee : Hilario Grajeda MVP : Alessandro Florenzi MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.25,"recall_5":0.5,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.234639363,"ndcg_cut_5":0.3462096432,"ndcg_cut_10":0.6084170171}}

In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

A female condom can provide greater protection than the male condom , as it covers the labia . The virus can not pass through a synthetic condom , but a male condom 's effectiveness is limited because herpes ulcers may appear on areas not covered by it . Neither type of condom prevents contact with the scrotum , anus , buttocks , or upper thighs , areas that may come in contact with ulcers or genital secretions during sexual activity . Protection against herpes simplex depends on the site of the ulcer ; therefore , if ulcers appear on areas not covered by condoms , abstaining from sexual activity until the ulcers are fully healed is one way to limit risk of transmission . The risk is not eliminated , however , as viral shedding capable of transmitting infection may still occur while the infected partner is asymptomatic . The use of condoms or dental dams also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals of one partner to the mouth of the other ( or vice versa ) during oral sex . When one partner has a herpes simplex infection and the other does not , the use of antiviral medication , such as valaciclovir , in conjunction with a condom , further decreases the chances of transmission to the uninfected partner .

The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived , with an initial television contract with the ABC network . The AFL 's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league . Meanwhile , the AFL introduced many new features to Professional Football in the United States : official time on the scoreboard clock , rather than on a watch in the referee 's pocket , as the NFL did ; optional two - point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns ; names on the jerseys of players ; and several others , including expansion of the role of minority players , actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL . The AFL also signed several star college players that had also been drafted by NFL teams . Competition for players heated up in 1965 , when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then - record US $437,000 contract . A five - year , $40 million NBC television contract followed , which helped to sustain the young league . The bidding war for players ended in 1966 , when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger , and the two leagues agreed on one that would take full effect in 1970 . This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year , and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league . That game began play at the end of the 1966 season . Once the merger was completed , it was no longer a championship game between two leagues , and reverted to the NFL championship game , which came to be known as the Super Bowl .","title":"American football","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_368-632-0-263","score":0.6739678383,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMLS All - Star Game Founded Region Major League Soccer ( CONCACAF ) Number of teams Current champions Real Madrid ( 1st title ) Most successful club ( s ) MLS All - Stars ( 9 times ) Television broadcasters FS1 , UniM\u00e1s , TSN , TVA Sports 2017 MLS All - Star Game","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_9675-9928-0-251","score":0.6725307703,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\n2015 MLS All - Star Game July 29 , 2015 MLS All - Stars 2 -- 1 Tottenham Hotspur ( show ) Dick 's Sporting Goods Park , Commerce City , Colorado Kak\u00e1 20 ' ( pen . ) Villa 23 ' Report Kane 37 ' Attendance : 18,671 Referee : Ismail Elfath MVP : Kak\u00e1 MLS","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"832021719_3512-3828-0-316","score":0.6720799208,"text":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nTeam Winner Runner - up Total MLS All - Stars 9 6 15 MLS East 5 6 Manchester United & -- MLS West 6 Arsenal & -- Everton & -- Roma & -- Real Madrid & -- MLS USA & -- Chelsea & -- Bayern Munich & -- Celtic & -- Fulham & -- Guadalajara & -- MLS World & -- Tottenham Hotspur & -- United States & -- West Ham United & --","title":"Major League Soccer All-Star Game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"856059988_1043-2017-0-974","score":0.6717525125,"text":"American football\nAmerican football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end .

Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football , it is much slower - paced than the more hectic rugby league , in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play . Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league ; defending players interfering with any other attacking player ( and vice versa ) will incur a penalty . Passing in the two sports also differs : while backward passing is common to both sports , in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal . Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield . To score a try or touchdown in rugby league , the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone , whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line . American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment , including helmets , gloves and padding around the body , whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league , usually amounting to light padding ( if any ) and soft head gear ( hard helmets being illegal ) .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV . Games use the Accelerometer and Gyroscope along with the touchpad found on the Siri Remote for control .

Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"836413300_27588-28266-0-678","score":0.7110561132,"text":"Infertility\nInfertility is often not seen ( by the West ) as being an issue outside industrialized countries .

Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well .

Hiring an attorney who specializes in reproductive law is thus strongly recommended , at least in the United States ; other countries may have other procedures for clarifying the parties ' rights , or may simply have legislation that defines the parties ' rights . In the US , before the egg donor 's IVF cycle begins she typically must sign the Egg Donor Contract , which specifies the rights of the donor and the recipient ( s ) with respect to the retrieved eggs , the embryos , and any children conceived from the donation . Such contracts should specify that the recipients are the legal parents of the child and the legal owners of any eggs or embryos resulting from the cycle ; in other words , while the donor has the right to cancel the cycle at any time prior to egg donation ( although if she does so the contract generally provides that she will not be paid ) , once the eggs are retrieved they belong to the recipient ( s ) . In individual cases the donors and parents may also wish to negotiate terms relating to any unused embryos ( e.g. , some donors would prefer that unused embryos be destroyed or donated to science , while others would prefer or allow them to be donated to another infertile couple ) . Some states have also adopted the Uniform Parentage Act , which provides that the recipient or recipients have complete parental responsibility of the conceived child .","title":"Egg donation","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801197945_14967-15359-0-392","score":0.6922035217,"text":"Egg donation\nAn egg donor may be motivated to donate eggs for altruistic reasons .

Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times felt that the song had `` worn out its welcome '' , and gave the performance a letter grade `` D '' . However , Jeremy Blacklow of Access Hollywood had a more positive feeling towards the performance , describing it as being `` so great '' in his live blog for the award ceremony . `` Empire State of Mind '' was performed by Jay - Z and Alicia Keys at the 2010 BRIT Awards on February 16 , 2010 . The Guardian wrote that Jay - Z and Alicia Keys `` dazzled with their rendition of `` Empire State of Mind '' `` . The Daily Mail commented on the performance that it was `` a rare highlight in a show of lowlights '' . According to Metro , Jay - Z and Alicia Keys `` blew the place away '' with their performance and `` Jay - Z was given a welcome befitting a cultural hero '' while `` Keys oozed elegance and soul as her startlingly powerful voice stopped everyone in their tracks '' . The Nation opined that the pair `` delivered a powerful rendition '' of the song .","title":"Empire State of Mind","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"807568393_801-1295-0-494","score":0.55194664,"text":"That's What I Like (Bruno Mars song)\n`` That 's What I Like '' is a song by American singer and songwriter Bruno Mars from his third studio album 24K Magic ( 2016 ) .

Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross the mountains and force temperatures to drop to about 12 \u00b0 F ( \u2212 11 \u00b0 C ) in central North Carolina . Still , temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of the mountains . The coldest ever recorded temperature in North Carolina was \u2212 34 \u00b0 F ( \u2212 37 \u00b0 C ) on January 21 , 1985 , at Mount Mitchell . The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream . The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still higher than the average ocean temperature in Maine during July . Snow is common in the mountains , although many ski resorts use snowmaking equipment to make sure there is always snow on their land . North Carolina 's relative humidity is highest in the winter .","title":"Climate of North Carolina","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"803493063_4363-5677-0-1314","score":0.7585086823,"text":"Climate of North Carolina\nSnow in North Carolina is seen on a regular basis in the mountains . North Carolina averages 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of snow a year . However , this also varies greatly across the state . Along the coast , most areas register less than 2 inches ( 51 mm ) per year while the state capital , Raleigh averages 7.5 inches ( 190 mm ) . Farther west in the Piedmont - Triad , the average grows to approximately 9 inches ( 230 mm ) . The Charlotte area averages approximately 6.5 inches ( 170 mm ) . The mountains in the west act as a barrier , preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont . When snow does make it past the mountains , it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days . However , several storms have dropped 18 inches ( 460 mm ) or more of snow within normally warm areas . The 1993 Storm of the Century that lasted from March 11 to March 15 affected locales from Canada to Central America , and brought a significant amount of snow to North Carolina . Newfound Gap received more than 36 inches ( 0.91 m ) of snow with drifts more than 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) , while Mount Mitchell measured over 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) of snow with drifts to 14 feet ( 4.3 m ) .

This storm affected only the Southeastern US coast , as far south as Savannah , GA , with little to no snow measured west of I - 95 . Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina . These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level , usually propelled southward from Arctic high pressure over the Northeastern or New England states . If the storms track sufficiently far to the east , snow will be limited to the eastern part of the state ( as with the December 22 - 23 , 1989 storm ) . If the cyclones travel close to the coast , warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean , bringing a rain \/ snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont , foothills and mountains , as with the January 22 , 1987 storm .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_191-787-0-560","score":0.7568778396,"text":"Great Wall of China\nGreat Wall of China \u842c\u91cc \u9577\u57ce The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling Map of all the wall constructions General information Type Fortification Country China Coordinates 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Coordinates : 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Technical details Size 21,196 km ( 13,171 mi ) UNESCO World Heritage Site Official name The Great Wall Type Cultural Criteria i , ii , iii , iv , vi Designated 1987 ( 11th session ) Reference no . 438 State Party China Region Asia - Pacific","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_21373-22657-0-1284","score":0.7562122941,"text":"Great Wall of China\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated , in many other locations the Wall is in disrepair .

Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling .

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit . These inputs were easily available in at least parts of the states of Punjab , Haryana , and western Uttar Pradesh ; thus , yields increased most in these states .","title":"Green Revolution in India","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

When successful , they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions . They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country , performing a repertoire of well - known plays , such as those by Shakespeare . The newspapers , private clubs , pubs , and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions . Henry Irving ( 1838 - 1905 ) was the most successful of the British actor - managers . Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles , and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience .

Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature ( with Macbeth , Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world 's greatest plays ) , and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language . Specifically , in plays like Hamlet , Shakespeare `` integrated characterization with plot , '' such that if the main character was different in any way , the plot would be totally changed . In Romeo and Juliet , Shakespeare mixed tragedy and comedy together to create a new romantic tragedy genre ( previous to Shakespeare , romance had not been considered a worthy topic for tragedy ) . Through his soliloquies , Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character 's inner motivations and conflict ( up until Shakespeare , soliloquies were often used by playwrights to `` introduce ( characters ) , convey information , provide an exposition or reveal plans '' ) .","title":"Shakespeare's influence","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.3333333333,"recall_10":0.6666666667,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.1815417925,"ndcg_cut_10":0.329582748}}

It is believed to have been written c. 1592 - 1594 . Although Richard III was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 20 October 1597 by the bookseller Andrew Wise , who published the first Quarto ( Q1 ) later that year ( with printing done by Valentine Simmes ) , Christopher Marlowe 's Edward II , which can not have been written much later than 1592 ( Marlowe died in 1593 ) is thought to have been influenced by it . A second Quarto ( Q2 ) followed in 1598 , printed by Thomas Creede for Andrew Wise , containing an attribution to Shakespeare on its title page . Q3 appeared in 1602 , Q4 in 1605 , Q5 in 1612 , and Q6 in 1622 , the frequency attesting to its popularity .

This is usually attributed to bias as a result of a new regime being in place , requiring that the last Plantagenet king , Richard III , be depicted as a villain .

However , since the Quarto contains many changes that can only be regarded as mistakes , it is now widely believed that the Quarto was produced by memorial reconstruction . It is thought likely that the Quarto was collectively produced by a company of actors remembering their lines . It is unknown why the actors did this , but it may have been to replace a missing prompt book . The Folio is regarded as having much higher authority than the Quarto , but because the Folio edition was collated by the printers against a Quarto ( probably Q3 ) , some errors from the Quarto found their way into the Folio . Some parts of the Folio ( the beginning of Act III and much of Act V ) are clearly copied , with little change , direct from the Quarto .

It is also possible that Shakespeare intended to portray Richard as `` ... a personification of the Machiavellian view of history as power politics '' . In this view , Richard is acting entirely out of his own free will in brutally taking hold of the English throne . Kiernan also presents this side of the coin , noting that Richard `` boasts to us of his finesse in dissembling and deception with bits of Scripture to cloak his ' naked villainy ' ( I. iii. 334 -- 8 ) ...

The Machiavellian reading of the play finds evidence in Richard 's interactions with the audience , as when he mentions that he is `` determin\u00e8d to prove a villain '' ( I.i. 30 ) . However , though it seems Richard views himself as completely in control , Lull suggests that Shakespeare is using Richard to state `` the tragic conception of the play in a joke .

Of all Shakespeare 's plays , the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was Macbeth , as Chinese audiences saw in a play first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland a parallel with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s . The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and furthermore , the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power - hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing . Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' .

The play 's director , the Shakespearean scholar Fang Ping who had suffered during the Cultural Revolution for studying this `` bourgeois Western imperialist '' , stated in an interview at the time that King Lear was relevant in China because King Lear , the `` highest ruler of a monarchy '' created a world full of cruelty and chaos where those who loved him were punished and those who did not were rewarded , a barely veiled reference to the often capricious behavior of Mao , who punished his loyal followers for no apparent reason .

Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state , whereas the League , fearing domination by the Hindu majority , desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim - majority regions .

Secular weddings are also common , often presided over by a judge , Justice of the Peace , or other municipal official .","title":"Society of the United States","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834160907_6215-6387-0-172","score":0.6791900396,"text":"Jumping the broom\nIn America the phrase could be used as slang describing the act of getting married legally , rather than as specifying an informal union not recognised by church or state .","title":"Jumping the broom","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"866379367_229-514-0-285","score":0.6670629382,"text":"Jewish wedding\nWhile wedding ceremonies vary , common features of a Jewish wedding include a ketubah ( marriage contract ) which is signed by two witnesses , a wedding canopy ( chuppah or huppah ) , a ring owned by the groom that is given to the bride under the canopy , and the breaking of a glass .","title":"Jewish wedding","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"866379367_4423-4624-0-201","score":0.6658737063,"text":"Jewish wedding\nIn traditional weddings , two blessings are recited before the betrothal ; a blessing over wine , and the betrothal blessing , which is specified in the Talmud .

Other occasions include retirement celebrations , housewarming parties , births , etc . The protocol for toasting at weddings is comparatively elaborate and fixed . At a wedding reception , the father of the bride , in his role as host , regularly offers the first toast , thanking the guests for attending , offering tasteful remembrances of the bride 's childhood , and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together . The best man usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds . A best man 's toast takes the form of a short speech ( 3 -- 5 minutes ) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity . The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom 's expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom , amongst others . The actual `` toast '' is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy , healthy , loving life together . The maid of honor may follow suit , appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride . The groom may offer the final toast , thanking the bride 's parents for hosting the wedding , the wedding party for their participation , and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids .","title":"Toast (honor)","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"834188205_34422-34758-0-336","score":0.6600985527,"text":"Defense of Marriage Act\nOur straightforward legal analysis sidesteps the fair point that same - sex marriage is unknown to history and tradition , but law ( federal or state ) is not concerned with holy matrimony .

If the first child is a girl , and they are able to have a second child , then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy . If a couple already has two or more boys , the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction . This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring , a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play .

A study by Anderson & Silver ( 1995 ) found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province : a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys . This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister , who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males , it was also much more likely to engage in `` stopping behavior '' , i.e. , to stop having more children .","title":"One-child policy","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"849505680_11708-12089-0-381","score":0.6272178292,"text":"Stepfamily\nIn Canada , one needs to put into writing what the child 's circumstances are for being adopted .

Aniston 's performance in Friends led to a successful film career . According to The Inquisitr News , Rachel is `` the role that would end up launching ( Aniston 's ) success '' , while Bradford Evans of Splitsider believes `` that Jennifer Aniston likely would n't have become a major movie star without Friends '' . While ranking Aniston the most attractive sitcom star of the 1990s , Josh Robertson of Complex magazine wrote that `` With the haircut , the TV fame , and a true gift for comedy ... combined , Aniston became a big star '' , replacing Cox as the show 's `` established hottie '' . According to Steve Charnock of Yahoo ! Movies , Aniston is `` the series ' only main cast member to become a bona fide movie star since the end of the show '' . While agreeing that Aniston 's film career has been successful , several critics believe that the actress ' filmography remains limited to playing Rachel - like roles in romantic comedies , save for some exceptions . Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian noted that `` Consequently , many of Aniston 's movie roles ... have been Rachel in all but name . '' Andrew Collins of Radio Times agreed , writing that Aniston `` seems trapped , perpetually playing variations of Rachel '' .

Feeling vulnerable , Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career , who encouraged her to audition for Friends , which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time . Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks . Meanwhile , NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel , replace Aniston , and reshoot several episodes if CBS ' series proved successful , which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars . However , Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail . Essentially , the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered , while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference towards Friends . During this time of uncertainty , Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends - related promotions and photo shoots ; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced . Aniston explained , `` When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they did n't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel . '' Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position . The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part , while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her , `` I 'm auditioning for your part in Friends .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time .

In 1840 Fones McCarthy received a patent for a `` Smooth Cylinder Cotton - gin '' , a roller gin . McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate . In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day .

Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .

Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased .
