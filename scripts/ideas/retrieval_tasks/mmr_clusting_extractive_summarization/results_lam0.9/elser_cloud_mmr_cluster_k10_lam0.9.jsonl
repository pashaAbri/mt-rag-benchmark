Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port.

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice.

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word \u201cimmutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption.

Read this documentation carefully to prevent any users in your organization from creating objects that can not be deleted, even by IBM Cloud administrators.\n\nThis feature can be used by any user that needs long-term data retention in their environment, including but not limited to organizations in the following industries:\n\n\n\n* Financial\n* Healthcare\n* Media content archives\n* Anyone looking to prevent privileged modification or deletion of objects or documents\n\n\n\nRetention policies can also be used by organizations that deal with financial records management, such as broker-dealer transactions, and might need to store data in a non-rewritable and non-erasable format.\n\nImmutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only, see [Integrated Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-availabilityservice-availability) for details.

A data scientist has a few large files that are used for analytics, a systems administrator needs to keep database backups synchronized with local files, and a developer is writing software that needs to read and write millions of files. Each of these scenarios is best served by different methods of data ingest.\n\nSome applications may wish to restrict a user or Service ID to only uploading data, without any access to reading data in a bucket. This is possible through the Object Writer [IAM role](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam).\n\n\n\n Using the console \n\nTypically, using the web-based console is not the most common way to use Object Storage. Objects are limited to 200 MB and the file name and key are identical. Multiple objects can be uploaded at the same time, and if the browser allows for multiple threads each object will be uploaded by using multiple parts in parallel. Support for larger object sizes and improved performance (depending on network factors) is provided by [Aspera high-speed transfer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-aspera).\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a compatible tool \n\nSome users want to use a stand-alone utility to interact with their storage. As the Cloud Object Storage API supports the most common set of S3 API operations, many S3-compatible tools can also connect to Object Storage by using [HMAC credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-uhc-hmac-credentials-main).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08007-5991-8147", "score": 16.477638, "text": "\n[Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage) is an alternative storage option that is useful for certain use cases, including backup and recovery, data archiving, cloud-native application building, and AI and big data analytics. Object Storage stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations.\n\nBy default, all objects that are stored in Object Storage are encrypted by using randomly generated keys and an all-or-nothing-transform (AONT). While this default encryption model provides at-rest security, financial service workloads need full control over the data encryption keys used. Again, Hyper Protect Crypto Services should be used for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Using IBM Cloud services outside of a VPC \n\nTo connect to IBM Cloud services from your VPC, you need to use [Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE) for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe). In the reference architecture diagram, VPEs appear in the middle subnets of the workload VPC. With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and IBM Cloud service on the private backbone. VPE for VPC gives you the experience of controlling all the private addressing within your cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Variation with edge/transit VPC for public internet access \n\nYou might want to allow consumers to access your service through the public internet. This base architecture can be adapted to securely enable this type of access as shown in the following diagram, which introduces a new edge VPC.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-detailed-vsi"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13064-7-2233", "score": 16.386456, "text": "\nWhat is IBM Cloud Object Storage? \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage is a highly available, durable, and secure platform for storing unstructured data. Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10864-7221-9477", "score": 16.371897, "text": "\nSupported data stores include SQL based relational databases, in-memory data grids, NoSQL database, files, messaging brokers, and various other systems.

For example, Watson Visual Recognition can be used with Cloud Functions to automatically extract useful information from videos without having to watch them. This technology is the \u201ccognitive\u201d extension of the [Data Processing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_casesuse_cases_data) use case that was discussed earlier. Another good use for Cloud Functions is to implement Bot function that is combined with cognitive services.\n\nA sample application, [Dark vision](https://github.com/IBM-cloud/openwhisk-darkvisionapp), is provided and does just that. In this application, the user uploads a video or image by using the Dark Vision web application, which stores it in an IBM Cloudant DB. Once the video is uploaded, Cloud Functions detect the new video by listening to IBM Cloudant changes (trigger). Cloud Functions then triggers the video extractor action. During its execution, the extractor produces frames (images) and stores them in IBM Cloudant. The frames are then processed with Watson Visual Recognition, and the results are stored in the same IBM Cloudant DB. The results can be viewed by using the Dark Vision web application or an iOS application. IBM Cloud Object Storage can be used in addition to IBM Cloudant, where video and image metadata are stored in IBM Cloudant, and the media files are stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n Event processing with Kafka or Event Streams \n\nCloud Functions is ideally to be used in combination with Kafka, IBM\u00ae Event Streams for IBM Cloud\u00ae (Kafka based), and other messaging systems.

With Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud in multiple regions, their analysis apps can be containerized and deployed across the globe, improving availability and addressing local regulations. Those deployments are accelerated with familiar open source tools, already part of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\nThey started by containerizing the analysis apps and putting them in the cloud. In a flash, their hardware headaches went away. They were able to easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their high-performance CPU, RAM, storage, and security needs. And when their analysis apps change, they can add or shrink compute without huge hardware investments. With the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance.

All of IBM Cloudant's functions are included, but Lite plan instances have a fixed amount of provisioned throughput capacity and data storage. The provisioned throughput capacity is fixed at 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second, and data storage is capped at 1 GB.\n\nStorage usage is checked daily. If you exceed your 1-GB storage limit, requests to the IBM Cloudant instance receive a 402 status code with the following error message, Account exceeded its data usage quota. An upgrade to a paid plan is required. A banner also appears on the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. You can still read and delete data. However, to write new data, you have two options. First, you can upgrade to a paid [Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan), which removes the write limitation immediately. Alternatively, you can delete data so that your total storage falls under the 1-GB limit and wait until the next daily storage check runs for your instance to allow writes again.\n\nIf you want to store more than one GB of data, or be able to scale provisioned throughput capacity, move to the [Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan).\n\nYou're limited to one IBM Cloudant Lite plan instance per IBM Cloud account. If you already have one Lite plan instance, you can't create a second Lite plan instance, or change a Standard plan instance to a Lite plan. If you try, you see the following message.

These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths.

When you create the enterprise, the account is added to the enterprise hierarchy. Billing transitions to being managed by the enterprise, but its users and resources remain the same and are completely unaffected.

The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize).

Then, click Create.\n\nAfter the account is added to the enterprise, it can't be removed. Be sure you want to permanently move the account to an enterprise.\n\n\n\nAfter a few moments, your enterprise is created, and you can view the enterprise dashboard. Your IBMid is listed as the contact. The contact serves as a focal point for any enterprise concerns, such as billing or usage questions.

In this case, you want to give department leads of the Marketing, Development, and Sales account groups access to manage their accounts and resource usage, and you want the Example Corp. financial officer to have access to view the entire enterprise's billing and usage. To give other users access, you invite them to the enterprise account and assign them the appropriate access.\n\nFirst, invite the department leads and assign them access.\n\n\n\n1.

For details, see [Managing resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manage_resource). Enterprise users can't directly work with resources within child accounts, but they can monitor the resource types and plans that are used in each account by viewing their usage.

This separation means that users who manage your enterprise can't access account resources within the child accounts unless you specifically enable them to. For example, your financial officer can have the Administrator role on the Billing account management service within the enterprise account, which provides them access to billing and payment information and usage data down to the resource type. But, unless they are invited to a child account and are assigned access to the Billing account management service for that account, they can't view offers or update spending limits for the child account.\n\nFor more information, see [User management for enterprises](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-enterprise-access-management).\n\n\n\n\n\n How can I use an enterprise? \n\nEnterprises can help simplify account and billing management for otherwise complex scenarios. Enterprises can be beneficial for managing any large organization, but two primary use cases where you might want to create them are large companies and educational institutions.\n\nHow you structure your enterprise depends on how you want to analyze usage and costs, such as to charge back usage to a particular group. Organize your enterprise according to how you want to track and manage billing and usage.\n\n\n\n Large companies or organizations \n\nEnterprises can be valuable for large organizations that otherwise require multiple separate accounts for their departments or teams. By using account groups, you can model your enterprise hierarchy after your organization's structure.\n\n\n\n Organize by department \n\nIf your organization has global teams that share a budget, you can model your enterprise structure after their departments. With this structure, you can view usage costs that are aggregated for each department.\n\nZoom\n\n![A four-tier enterprise that groups accounts according to department in an organization.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3.

This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors.

Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions. For more information, see the section on [partitioned tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogpartitioned).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}]}

It also manages tables and views in a catalog that is compatible with Hive metastore and other big data engines and services can connect to it. See [Overview of IBM Cloud Data Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overview).\n\nEach instance of IBM Cloud Data Engine includes a database catalog that you can use to register and manage table definitions for your data on IBM Cloud Object Storage. Catalog syntax is compatible with Hive metastore syntax. You can use IBM Cloud Data Engine to externalize metadata outside the IBM Analytics Engine Spark cluster.\n\n\n\n Pre-requisites \n\nThe following are the pre-requisites:\n\n\n\n* Creating IBM Cloud Data Engine instance\n* Storing data in Cloud Object Storage\n* Creating schema\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating IBM Cloud Data Engine instance \n\n{: metastore-prerequisite_line1}\n\nCreate an IBM Cloud Data Engine instance by using the Standard plan.\u00a0See [Data Engine](http://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/data-engine-previously-sql-query).\n\nAfter you have provisioned the Data Engine instance:\n1.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS statement to attach the partitions. For more information, see the section on [partitioned tables](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogpartitioned).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09950-7-1844", "score": 18.53588, "text": "\nTables \n\nIn the table from the Tables tab, the value that is displayed in the row count column is an approximate. The exact row count is available after you run the GENERATE STATISTICS ON <table_name> command.\n\n\n\n Creating tables \n\n\n\n1. Go to Databases.\n2. Select the database in which you want to create a table.\n3. Select the schema in which you want to create a table.\n4. Ensure that you are in the DB Objects > Tables tab.\n5. Click Create table.\n6. Type a name for the table.\nIf the name contains special characters, enclose it in double quotation marks. The dot character (\".\") is not supported.\nYou can select a name that has up to 128 characters. The name must begin with a letter or an underscore and can't contain embedded spaces. The name must be unique.\n7. Optional: Specify the retention time interval (in days) for the table.\nYou can select between 1 day and up to 99 days, or zero to alter a temporal table to nontemporal.\n8. Add columns to the table:\n\n\n\n1. In the Columns section, under Name, type a name for the column. The name must start with a letter.\n2. Select your column type.\nThe data type restricts the type of data that can be stored in a column. For example, preventing entry of alphanumeric characters into a numeric field.\nData types also help sort data correctly and play a role in optimizing storage. For all these reasons, it is important to pick the appropriate data type.\n3. Specify whether Not null is true or false.\nA column that allows NULL values also allows rows to be inserted with no value in that column. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value.\n4. Specify the default value to be used if no value is specified when a row is inserted.\n5.

CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00646-3898-5632", "score": 21.781174, "text": "\nFor example, when your webpage is first loaded, it calls the GET /todolist endpoint. The GET /todolist endpoint uses the postFind method to query the database for all documents (by using the index created after the todo database), and then orders the notes by timestamp, and returns them to the front end for display.\n\nFiltering by tag uses the same postFind method, but by using the second index, you create and delete notes by using the postDocument and deleteDocument methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIBM Cloudant allows rapid development of web applications, as its HTTP API is modeled by the [Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ibm-cloud/cloudant) and is easy to integrate with your own code. You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant). Don't forget. The [IBM Cloudant Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-connectingibm-cloudant-dashboard) is a great way to explore your databases, create and modify documents, and refine your index and querying skills.\n\nYou can find more best practice guidance in our [blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/11/21/Best-and-Worst-Practices.html) and [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant/getting-started.html).

Create some sample data that represents a book in a library as shown in the following example:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"BXP9G5ZQY9Q4EA13\",\n\"author\": \"Dickens\",\n\"title\": \"David Copperfield\",\n\"year\": 1840,\n\"pages\": 723,\n\"publisher\": \"Penguin\",\n\"url\": \"https://www.somurl.com/dc\"\n}\n3. Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3. A report that details the number of books that are published by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens. This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. It also has some powerful counting aggregations suitable for drill-down user interfaces.\n\nIBM Cloudant Search also powers type=text IBM Cloudant Query indexes, so a subset of its capabilities is surfaced by using the _find API.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00472-16393-17597", "score": 21.16656, "text": "\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to query a global index:\n\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\n\nSee the following example that uses the command line to query a global index:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl \"https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1\"\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.PostSearchOptions;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.SearchResult;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nPostSearchOptions searchOptions = new PostSearchOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"<db-name>\")\n.ddoc(\"<ddoc>\")\n.index(\"<index-name>\")\n.query(\":\")\n.includeDocs(true)\n.limit(1)\n.build();\n\nSearchResult response =\nservice.postSearch(searchOptions).execute()\n.getResult();\n\nSystem.out.println(response);\n\nimport { CloudantV1 } from '@ibm-cloud/cloudant';\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({});\n\nservice.postSearch({\ndb: '<db-name>',\nddoc: '<ddoc>',\nindex: '<index-name>',\nquery: ':',\nincludeDocs: true,\nlimit: 1", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-60601-62822", "score": 21.135118, "text": "\nWhen you create a secondary index, you choose whether its purpose is for per-partition or global scope.\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00539-7-1755", "score": 21.024532, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloudant Query FAQ \n\n[IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query) is an API for querying slices of data based on the values of a database's document attributes. It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00469-13046-15136", "score": 20.971407, "text": "\nYou might find that you\u2019re mainly hitting the Query limit, but you have plenty of headroom in Lookups. It might be possible to reduce the reliance on Queries through some remodeling of the data or perhaps doing more work client-side.\n\nThe corollary here though is that you can\u2019t assume that any third-party library or framework optimizes for cost ahead of convenience. Client-side frameworks that support multiple persistence layers by using plug-ins are unlikely to be aware of this situation, or might be incapable of making such tradeoffs.\n\nChecking for third-party library or framework compatibility before you commit to a particular tool is a good idea.\n\nIt is also worth understanding that the rates aren\u2019t directly equivalent to HTTP API endpoint calls. You must expect that, for example, a bulk update counts according to its constituent document writes.\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant documentation on [plans and pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public) on IBM public cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Logging helps you see what\u2019s going on \n\nIBM Cloudant\u2019s logs indicating each API call made, what was requested and how long it took to respond can be automatically spooled to LogDNA for analysis and reporting for IBM Cloud-based services. This data is useful for keeping an eye on request volumes, performance, and whether your application is exceeding the provisioned capacity for your IBM Cloudant service.\n\nYou can set up the logging service at no cost to get started. Paid-for plans allow data to be parsed, retained, and archived to Object Storage.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 20.896208, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

The possible vulnerabilities are updated daily by using the published security notices for the Docker image types that are listed in the following table. Typically, for a vulnerable package to pass the scan, a later version of the package is required that includes a fix for the vulnerability. The same package can list multiple vulnerabilities, and in this case, a single package update can address multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nVulnerability Advisor returns vulnerabilities only when a package fix is published by the distributor. Declared vulnerabilities that aren't fixed yet, or are not going to be fixed, are not reported by Vulnerability Advisor.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata.

However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06836-7-1886", "score": 15.0397215, "text": "\nCustom scripts \n\nCustom scripts are extension points in the pipeline where adopters, teams, and users can provide scripts to run custom tasks that are required by their continuous integration and continuous deployment strategies.\n\nCustom scripts control the pipeline stages.

You can buy your first subscription, add more subscriptions, and monitor subscription usage on the Subscriptions page in the IBM Cloud console.\n\nIf you buy a subscription, your account is converted to a Subscription account type. For more details about other benefits of Subscription accounts, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n How subscription credit is spent \n\nSubscriptions can provide the following two types of credit, which are divided into separate pools:\n\n\n\n* Credit from platform subscriptions that pays for resource usage\n* Credit from support subscriptions that pays for support costs\n\n\n\nEach platform or support subscription is purchased for a given credit amount and duration. If the subscription duration is more than a year, the subscription is separated into terms of up to one year each. Each term has distinct start dates, end dates, and available credit. You can use the available credit at any point during the term, but credit doesn't roll over to any following terms in the subscription. You can get extra flexibility to use credit from terms that haven't yet started by paying up-front for the entire subscription rather than using monthly, quarterly, or another recurring billing cadence. If your usage exceeds your available credit, the extra usage is billed as overage at the non-discounted rate.\n\nFor example, say that you buy an IBM Cloud platform subscription for $1,000 a month for two years, and the subscription starts 1 July 2019. The subscription is divided into two terms that each contain $12,000 of credit, with one term valid from 1 July 2019 through 30 June 2020, and the next term valid from 1 July 2020 through 30 June 2021. You can use the $12,000 credit of the first term at any time during its one-year period, whether it's $6,500 the first month and $500 a month afterward or $1,000 each month. If you spend $13,000 during that time period and don't have any other active subscriptions, the extra $1,000 is billed as overage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03729-4932-7001", "score": 19.569632, "text": "\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours).

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans.

An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into.

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region. When the failover needs to be manually triggered, make the following changes:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-failover"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03312-5487-7760", "score": 17.868557, "text": "\nIf a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call.

It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent.

Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages.

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region. When the failover needs to be manually triggered, make the following changes:\n\n\n\n* The embed script that contains your integration ID, region, service instance ID, and subscription ID (if applicable) needs be changed or updated to use the IDs for the new integration and region.\n* If you are using Salesforce or ZenDesk integrations for connecting to human agents, update the configuration within those systems to make sure they can communicate with the correct integration. Follow the instructions on the Live agent tab in the web chat configuration for setting up those systems.

You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region.

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

A service credential is a collection of important information that is needed to connect to an instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage. It gives a user an identifier for the instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage (that is, the Resource Instance ID), service and authorization endpoints, and a means of associating the subject with an API key (that is, Service ID).

For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials. Now, that user can interact with the development repo in the way that they need to get their job done.\n\nNow, looking at a cloud native application story, we have many microservices that must talk to each other. So, let's look at that. Let's call it service \"A,\" that needs to interact with a database called \"DB\" and grab a piece of specific information that it needs to get its job done. What it needs, in the form of the secret here, is what we call \"DB configs.\" Again, this DB config is going to allow it to have the correct communication with the service by saying, this is who I am and this is what I came here to accomplish.\n\nBut now that we have our user credentials in our DB configs as examples of secrets, we realize the vulnerability that can be created here if these credentials were to fall into the wrong hands.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"}]}

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 19.888796, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 14.373378, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

However, these safe default settings do not provide the best security posture for every customer. Take the following steps to be sure that your CIS account is configured in a safe and secure way.\n\nRecommendations and best practices:\n\n\n\n* Secure your origin IP addresses by proxying and increasing obfuscation\n* Configure your security level selectively\n* Activate your Web Application Firewall (WAF) safely\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 1: Secure your origin IP addresses \n\nWhen a subdomain is proxied using CIS, all traffic is protected because we actively respond with IP addresses specific to CIS (for example, all of your clients connect to CIS proxies first, and your origin IP addresses are obscured).\n\n\n\n Use CIS proxies for all DNS records for HTTP(S) traffic from your origin \n\nTo improve the security of your origin IP address, you should proxy all HTTP(S) traffic.\n\nSee the difference yourself - Query a non-proxied and a proxied record:\n\ndig nonproxied.theburritobot.com +short\n1.2.3.4 (The origin IP address)\n\n$ dig proxied.theburritobot.com +short\n104.16.22.6 , 104.16.23.6 (CIS IP addresses)\n\n\n\n\n\n Obscure non-proxied origin records with non-standard names \n\nAny records that cannot be proxied through CIS, and that still use your origin IP, such as FTP, can be secured by creating additional obfuscation. In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com. This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-ibm-cis-for-optimal-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04107-4464-6614", "score": 12.668298, "text": "\n* Specific URLs - For example, you can allow IP 1.2.3.4 access to directory example.com/foo/ and allow IP 5.6.7.8 access to directory example.com/bar/, but not allow the reverse.\n\n\n\nThis capability is useful when you need more granularity in your access rules because, with IP rules, you can either apply the block to all subdomains of the current domain, or all domains on your account. You cannot specify URIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Firewall rules \n\nCreate rules that examine incoming HTTP traffic against a set of filters to block, challenge, log, or allow matching requests.\n\nIn general, firewall rules are designed for properties that are exposed in OSI Layer-7 (HTTP), such as request headers and body content characteristics. Therefore, firewall rules apply to HTTP/HTTPS [Range](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-cis-range) apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n Events \n\nView events that are triggered by an active web application firewall rule. For each event, you can change the triggered action based on the requesting IP address, or the requesting region as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n Range \n\nExtend the power of CIS DDoS, TLS, and IP firewall to your web servers and your TCP-based services by using Range applications, keeping them online and secure.\n\n\n\n\n\n Advanced security \n\nAdvanced security settings include the following features, which you can change, enable, or disable.\n\n\n\n* Browser integrity check - The browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks or challenges visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a nonstandard user agent. This tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs.\n* Challenge passage - Controls how long a visitor that passed a challenge (or JavaScript challenge) gains access to your site before they are challenged again. This challenge is based on the visitor's IP, and therefore does not apply to challenges presented by WAF rules because they are based on an action that the user performs on your site.\n* Security level - Sets the security level of your website to determine which visitors receive a challenge page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04114-3937-5977", "score": 12.565446, "text": "\nCIS does cache a website's robots.txt.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com. This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-ibm-cis-for-optimal-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04177-7-2309", "score": 18.880276, "text": "\nManaging your CIS deployment \n\nYou'll begin by using the Overview screen as your working base of operations.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}]}

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

By default, the public and private cloud service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands.

Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per core, such as 10. - Avoid node overload: Similarly, just because a node can contain more than 100 pods doesn't mean that you want it to. Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per node, such as 40. - Don't tap out your cluster bandwidth**: Keep in mind that network bandwidth on scaling virtual machines is around 1000 Mbps. If you need hundreds of worker nodes in a cluster, split it up into multiple clusters with fewer nodes, or order bare metal nodes. - Sorting out your services: Plan out how many services that you need for your workload before you deploy. Networking and port forwarding rules are put into Iptables.

Rather than installing each open source project on your system, and learn the API or CLI. You can declare the tasks that you want to run in IBM Cloud and watch Schematics run these tasks for you.\n\nFor more information about how Schematics Works, see [About IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is Infrastructure as Code? \n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) helps you codify your cloud environment so that you can automate the provisioning and management of your resources in the cloud. Rather than manually provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources or by using scripts to adjust your cloud environment, you use a high-level scripting language to specify your resource and its configuration. Then, you use tools like Terraform to provision the resource in the cloud by using its API. Your infrastructure code is treated the same way as your app code so that you can apply DevOps core practices such as version control, testing, and continuous monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n What am I charged for when I use Schematics? \n\nIBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the ibmcloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match.

The list starts with the most fundamental concepts.\n\n\n\n Hardware security module \n\nA hardware security module (HSM) is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing. HSMs of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services are FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified, which is the highest level of security for cryptographic hardware. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Crypto units \n\nA crypto unit is a single unit that represents an HSM and the corresponding software stack that is dedicated to the HSM for cryptography. In Hyper Protect Crypto Services, the following types of crypto unit are available:\n\n\n\n* Operational crypto unit", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13108-7-2001", "score": 14.47674, "text": "\nAbout Key Protect \n\nIBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae is a full-service encryption solution that allows data to be secured and stored in IBM Cloud using the latest envelope encryption techniques that leverage FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified cloud-based hardware security modules.\n\nSensitive data should not be stored on any cloud provider unencrypted (as \"plaintext\", in other words). But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08462-7-2096", "score": 14.267757, "text": "\nProtecting your data with envelope encryption - Standard Plan \n\nEnvelope encryption is the practice of encrypting data with a\n\ndata encryption key (DEK)and then wrapping the DEK with aroot keythat you can fully manage.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb/vpc/images/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15852-1290-3307", "score": 18.74405, "text": "\nCanada (Toronto) ca-tor https://ca-tor.iaas.cloud.ibm.com https://ca-tor.private.iaas.cloud.ibm.com \n\n\n\nThe Madrid region only supports dedicated host profiles with instance storage.

From inside the VPC infrastructure, you can access two types of IBM Cloud endpoints: platform as a service (PaaS) endpoints, also known as service endpoints, and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) endpoints.\n\nAlthough the addresses for these endpoints look as if they communicate through the public internet, traffic to and from these endpoints does not leave IBM Cloud. Therefore, this traffic avoids the bandwidth charges associated with traffic that exits the cloud and goes onto the public internet.\n\n\n\n Service endpoints \n\nUse service endpoints to securely connect to IBM Cloud services over the IBM Cloud private network. These endpoints are available through DNS (Domain Name System) names in the cloud.ibm.com domain and resolve to 166.8.0.0/14 addresses.\n\nTraffic to and from service endpoints are subject to ACL and security group rules. In other words, these mechanisms can be used in cases where you want to limit what virtual server instances use a particular service endpoint.\n\nVPCs are automatically able to reach service endpoints. For more information about service endpoints, see [Services that support service endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpointuse-service-endpoint). After you provision a service as a private endpoint, ping the endpoint from your virtual server instance to verify that the endpoint is reachable.\n\nYou can also use VPN for VPC to access service endpoints.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-service-endpoints-for-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-187656-189537", "score": 18.72552, "text": "\nA Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides network isolation and security in the IBM Cloud.

This specification defines a set of common attributes that can be included with each event to provide a common set of metadata. By looking at the metadata, you can quickly understand key pieces of the message without parsing and understanding the entirety of the event payload. For example, each event that is delivered to an application includes an HTTP header that is called ce-type, which indicates the semantic meaning (or \"reason\") for the event. An event from a database might include a ce-type value of com.example.row.deleted, indicating that the event was generated because a row was deleted in the database.\n\nThe following table lists some key common attributes.

No two events from the same event producer are assigned the same value. \n Source This required attribute specifies the context in which the event occurred. For example, for an object storage system, this value might be the bucket in which the object in question resides. \n Specversion This required attribute indicates the version of the CloudEvents specification that the event uses. \n Type This required attribute describes the type of the event. For example, the type of event might be that a resource was created or deleted. \n Subject This optional attribute indicates the resource about which the event is related. For example, in an object storage system, this value might be the object from the bucket that was modified. \n Time This optional attribute is the timestamp of when the occurrence happened. \n\n\n\nFor more information about the complete list of attributes, see the [CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).\n\nIn Code Engine, when events are delivered to applications, the CloudEvent attributes appear as HTTP headers, prefixed with ce-.

Your assistant remembers this information, and other information about a conversation, as variables. Your assistant can use variables to provide a more personalized and customized experience, and to get users quickly to the solutions they need.\n\nVariables are a powerful tool that you can use to build a better assistant. Variables make possible all of the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* Personalization. The best virtual assistant experiences are targeted and personalized for each customer. When an assistant greets a customer by saying \"Hello, Frank! Welcome back,\" it tells Frank that it remembers his name and that it has talked to him before. By storing this kind of information in variables and then referencing them in your assistant's output, you can personalize the conversation and help your assistant seem more human.\n* Acceleration. Over the course of a conversation, your customers answer questions and make choices. These customer responses are stored as variables, which your assistant can then use to guide a conversation. By choosing the right steps and not wasting your customers' time, you can get them as quickly as possible to the right solution.\n* Modularity. Some information might be useful for many different purposes (for example, a customer's current account balance or contact information). Rather than retrieving or recalculating this information in multiple locations, you can do so once, by using a variable to store the result and then access it wherever you need it.\n\n\n\nA variable is simply a named container for a piece of information; by referencing this container by name, your assistant can store or retrieve the information at run time. For example, a variable that is called account_balance might store your customer's current account balance, a value your assistant can update or retrieve as needed.\n\nThe data that is stored by a variable is characterized by the type of data that it contains, such as text, a numeric value, a date, or even a list of multiple values. The operations that you can perform with a variable vary depending on its data type.\n\n\n\n Action variables and session variables \n\nWatson Assistant supports two categories of variables:\n\n\n\n* Action variables: When a step collects information from the customer, the customer response is automatically stored in an action variable.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05427-8556-10476", "score": 4.722666, "text": "\nA typical example is the processing of image data in a Object Storage bucket or serving machine learning models.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash.

This encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Masking: \n\nData Security Broker can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration to external parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deployment Plans in IBM Cloud Data Data Security Broker: \n\nWhen you assign and customize default Data Protection Policies with Data Security Broker Manager, there are three options that you can choose to implement your data encryption policy:\n\n\n\n Save Policy: \n\nSave Policy option is selected by default. This option saves your selected data, but does not execute encryption or data protection on your database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new policy is saved to overwrite it. You can use the saved policy to deploy or migrate it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n Deploy Policy: \n\nDeploy Policy option saves your policy and deploys your configured Data Security Broker Shield as a proxy for the configured database.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12678-7-2410", "score": 17.928644, "text": "\nKnown issues (Limitations) \n\nUse this topic to find the details of the limitations that are applicable to the Data Security Broker software.\n\n\n\n Application-level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker encryption gives database applications a no-code way to implement application-level encryption. Application-level encryption can be implemented by including a database proxy that intercepts and encrypts sensitive data in accordance with the pre-established data protection policy.\n\nData Security Broker encryption has some restrictions, like any other approaches to the application-level encryption implementation. The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location.

Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers.

For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price.

This is set at a per object level.\n\n\n\n\n\n Event-based retention \n\nImmutable Object Storage allows users to set indefinite retention on the object if they are unsure of the final duration of the retention period, or want to use event-based retention. Once set to indefinite, user applications can then can change the object retention to a finite value later. For example, a company has a policy of retaining employee records for three years after the employee leaves the company. When an employee joins the company, the records that are associated with that employee can be indefinitely retained. When the employee leaves the company, the indefinite retention is converted to a finite value of three years from the current time, as defined by company policy. The object is then protected for three years after the retention period change. A user or third-party application can change the retention period from indefinite to finite retention that uses an SDK or REST API.\n\n\n\n\n\n Permanent retention \n\nPermanent retention ensures that data can not be deleted, ever, by anyone. Read the documentation carefully and do not use permanent retention unless there is a compelling regulatory or compliance need for permanent data storage.\n\nPermanent retention can only be enabled at a IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket level with retention policy enabled and users are able to select the permanent retention period option during object uploads. Once enabled, this process can't be reversed and objects uploaded that use a permanent retention period cannot be deleted. It's the responsibility of the users to validate at their end if there's a legitimate need to permanently store objects by using Object Storage buckets with a retention policy.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutable"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05044-62456-64487", "score": 13.465668, "text": "\nThe retention period of an object can only be extended.

It is the responsibility of the external service to display a message that is shown to the user that explains that the conversation is being transferred. The dialog does not manage that communication itself. The dialog transfer does not occur when you are testing nodes with this response type in the Try it out pane. You must access a node that uses this response type from a test deployment to see how your users will experience it.\n* Image: Embeds an image into the response. The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options. When a user clicks one of the options, an associated user input value is sent to your assistant. How options are rendered can differ depending on where you deploy the dialog. For example, in one integration channel the options might be displayed as clickable buttons, but in another they might be displayed as a dropdown list.\n* Pause: Forces the application to wait for a specified number of milliseconds before continuing with processing. You can choose to show an indicator that the dialog is working on typing a response. Use this response type if you need to perform an action that might take some time. For example, a parent node makes a Cloud Function call and displays the result in a child node. You could use this response type as the response for the parent node to give the programmatic call time to complete, and then jump to the child node to show the result.

At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person. Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request.

Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it.

Containment is the rate at which your assistant is able to satisfy a customer's request without human intervention per conversation.\n\nTo measure containment accurately, the metric must be able to identify when a human intervention occurs. The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant. For example, you might direct customers to your call center phone number or to an online support ticket form URL. If so, you need to flag these types of redirects so the containment metric is able to pick them up.\n\nTo enable the containment metric, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "score": 13.890135, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03126-1789-4208", "score": 13.115055, "text": "\nActivate a credit card Your assistant can use a conversational flow to collect information for identity verification, and then call a webhook to submit the request to activate the card on the user's behalf. \n Complete a simple task that involves a complicated application Your assistant can link them to a 2-minute video that illustrates how to complete the task. \n Learn about insurance plan details after the death of a loved one Your assistant can connect the customer directly to a person who can show empathy and patience as the matter is addressed. \n Solve a problem that requires a long and involved procedure to fix Instead of trying to walk the customer through the procedure step by step in conversation, your assistant can link to a help center that documents the full procedure in detail. \n The customer calls support and your assistant answers Let's say the assistant needs a lot of details from the customer before it can help. Instead of trying to prompt the customer for each piece of information and transcribe it properly, your assistant can switch to SMS text messaging.

Click the Dialog tab, and then click Create dialog.\n\nWhen you open the dialog editor for the first time, the following nodes are created for you:\n\n\n\n* Welcome: The first node. It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs that are deployed in environments such as messaging channels where customers start the conversation do not process nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\n2.

After defining the intent, you can add a root-level dialog node that conditions on the intent. As the dialog node response, add a Connect to human agent response type. At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person.

For example, if a user asks for store locations, you could show a map and display a button for each store location that the user can click to get address details. To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response. Meaning, if you define three conditional responses for a dialog node, each conditional response can have no more than 5 response types added to it.\n\nA single dialog node cannot have more than one Connect to human agent or more than one Search skill response.\n3.

Therefore, you need to create intents that handle inquiries related to the following subjects:\n\n\n\n* Restaurant information\n* Menu details\n* Order cancellations\n\n\n\nYou'll start by creating intents that represent these subjects, and then build a dialog that responds to user questions about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Answer questions about the restaurant \n\nAdd an intent that recognizes when customers ask for details about the restaurant itself. An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input. The General_About_You intent that is provided with the General content catalog serves a similar function, but its user examples are designed to focus on queries about the assistant as opposed to the business that is using the assistant to help its customers.

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

For example, IBM manages and automatically applies updates to your cluster master. For your worker nodes, IBM provides security and version updates, but you must apply the updates. You are also responsible for your workload applications and data. For more information, see [Your responsibilities while using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks).\n\n\n\n\n\n What if some part of the service fails to comply with a recommendation? \n\nFirst, check the explanation of the failure for any remediation steps.\n\nThen, determine whether the failure is acceptable according to your security requirements. For example, some recommendations might be more in-depth configuration requirements than your particular processes or standards require. Also, some recommendations are not scored, and don't impact the overall benchmark score.\n\nNext, decide whether the component falls within your responsibility. If so, you might need to change how you configure that component. For example, you might configure pod security policies for all your app deployments. For components that are not directly within your responsibility, assess whether you can use another IBM Cloud service to meet the recommendation.\n\n\n\n\n\n What else can I do to increase the security and compliance of my cluster? \n\nSee [Security for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Running the worker node CIS Kubernetes benchmark \n\nTo review the results of the CIS Kubernetes benchmark for Section 4: Worker node security configuration, you can run the test yourself. Because you own the worker nodes and are partially [responsible](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks) for their compliance, you might make configuration changes that you want to validate on your own.\n\nBefore you begin: [Log in to your account.

They created clusters for a Development environment that allow worldwide Developers to collaboratively deploy app improvements quickly.\n\nSecurity first: The Development Exec chose bare metal to host the research clusters. With bare metal for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, the sensitive research workloads now have familiar isolation but within the flexibility of public cloud.

For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted.

With IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service in multiple regions, their analysis apps can be containerized and deployed across the globe, improving availability and addressing local regulations. Those deployments are accelerated with familiar open source tools, already part of IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nThey started by containerizing the analysis apps and putting them in the cloud. In a flash, their hardware headaches went away. They were able to easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their high-performance CPU, RAM, storage, and security needs. And when their analysis apps change, they can add or shrink compute without huge hardware investments. With the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance.

The provider\u2019s high-use SaaS systems, which held both patient record systems and business report apps, needed updates frequently. Yet the on-premises environment hindered agile development. The provider also wanted to counteract increasing labor costs and a decreasing budget.\n\nThey started by containerizing their SaaS systems and putting them in the cloud. From that first step, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the SaaS apps, they easily designed Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. Another factor for decreased staff costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the provider can focus on delivering better customer service.\n\nAccelerated development is a key win for the IT Exec. With the move to public cloud, Developers can experiment easily with Node.js SDK, pushing changes to Development and Test systems, scaled out on separate clusters. Those pushes were automated with open toolchains and IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery. Updates to the SaaS system no longer languished in slow, error-prone build processes.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05723-3429-5611", "score": 22.780315, "text": "\nThus, they chose IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service because IBM simplifies infrastructure management.\n\n\n\n* Managing Kubernetes master, IaaS, and operational components, such as Ingress and storage\n* Monitoring health and recovery for worker nodes\n* Providing global compute, so Developers don\u2019t have to stand up infrastructure in worldwide regions where they need workloads and data to be located\n\n\n\nMoving compute workloads into the IBM Cloud isn't enough though.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai). Each instance is deployed in a highly available configuration; that is, data is replicated by each database onto one or more servers, making the data highly available during normal operations.\n\n\n\n* In MZRs, database members are distributed across different data centers, or zones.\n* In single-campus multizone regions, database members are distributed across different hosts.\n\n\n\nIf a single-campus multizone region failure in an MZR or a hardware failure in any region occurs, your data is still accessible as it is replicated onto other fully functioning database servers.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST /$DATABASE/_index HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07103-1597-3698", "score": 16.709015, "text": "\nYou can now define JSON normalizations by using the Collections API\n: The Create a collection and Update a collection methods now support the addition of conversions and normalizations objects that you can specify to apply normalization operations to the documents in the collection. For example, you can define an operation to copy or merge one field to another in the JSON representation of the documents. The conversions object defines normalization operations that occur during ingestion and the normalizations object defines normalization operations that occur after enrichments are applied. For more information, see the [Collections API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery-datalistcollections).\n\n\n\n\n\n 31 March 2023 \n\nUpdate to API version\n: The current API version (v2) is now 2023-03-31. One change was made with this version.\n\nChanged how fields named document_id are handled\n: If you add a JSON file that contains a field named document_id to a collection, the field is ignored. The system assigns a new unique document ID to the document when it is added to the index. To assign a document ID to a document regardless of its file type, use the Update document method from the API.\n\nPreviously, when you uploaded a JSON file with a field named document_id from the product user interface or by using the Add document API method, the document ID from the file was shown as the document_id value in query results. However, a different document ID was assigned to the document, and the assigned ID had to be used for certain other tasks, such as deleting the document. If your application relies on the previous behavior, specify a version number earlier than 2023-03-31, such as 2020-08-30, in your API calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2 March 2023 \n\nNow you can specify the types of files to add to a collection\n: When you connect to an external data source, you can limit the types of files to add to the collection from the external data source.

You can use the count and offset parameters to page through the query results and save all of the documents.\n\nFor example, to get 100 documents at a time, you can set the count to 100 and offset to 0 and submit the query.\n\nGET {url}/v1/environments/{environment_id}/collections/{collection_id}/query?q=&count=100&offset=0\n\nNext, you can again set the count to 100, but this time set the offset to 100 to get the next 100 documents.\n\nGET {url}/v1/environments/{environment_id}/collections/{collection_id}/query?q=&count=100&offset=100\n\nRepeat this process, incrementing the offset by 100 until you retrieve all of the documents.\n3.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07232-3248-5115", "score": 13.802247, "text": "\nPNG, TIFF, and JPEG images embedded in PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files are also scanned, and any text is extracted.\n\nView the following table to see the objects that a data source can crawl and which data sources support crawling new and modified documents during a refresh:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The maximum bandwidth capacity is determined by the instance profile that you select during instance provisioning. For example, a bx2-2x8 balanced server profile allows a total instance bandwidth of 4,000 Mbps (4 Gbps). The initial storage and network bandwidth allocation depends on what you set by using the API or by the instance profile you selected.\n\nThe maximum bandwidth of a volume is the highest potential bandwidth that can be allocated to the volume when it is attached to an instance. In cases where the total maximum bandwidth of attached volumes exceeds the amount that is available on the instance, the bandwidth for each volume attachment is set proportionally. The bandwidth is allocated based on the corresponding volume's maximum bandwidth.\n\nFor example, for the bx2-2x8 profile you might have:\n\n\n\n* Volumes: 1,000 Mbps,\n* Network: 3,000 Mbps.\n\n\n\nTo ensure reasonable boot times, a minimum of 393 Mbps is allocated to the primary boot volume. In the example, the instance's total volume bandwidth is 1,000 Mbps and the remaining 607 Mbps is allocated to any secondary volumes that you attach, up to the maximum bandwidth of the volume. For example, if you have one data volume with 500 Mbps, you can expect to get that level of performance.\n\nEach volume has an IOPS and bandwidth limit set. The IOPS limit is always set to the maximum IOPS of the volume. The bandwidth for each attached volume is set proportionally based on the [volume size and profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles).\n\nFor optimal bandwidth to be realized, detach and reattach the volume after volume bandwidth allocation in the UI, CLI, or API.\n\n\n\n Adjusting volume bandwidth \n\nYou can change the volume/networking bandwidth ratio to meet your needs, but both volume and network bandwidth must be at least 500 Mbps each.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-bandwidth"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10774-3008-5059", "score": 14.353064, "text": "\nparameters The maximum size of the parameters that can be attached in MB.

Catalog syntax is compatible with Hive metastore syntax. See how to [work with the catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalogusage) and refer to the [Catalog management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterHiveCatalog) section of the SQL reference.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\nYou can explore, change, or discover structured data on [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/getting-started.htmlgetting-started-console) with Data Engine by using SQL syntax. To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog. Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-getting_started_catalog"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12868-2267-3850", "score": 19.34854, "text": "\n* Create an instance of [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage) and add your image to a bucket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Importing a version to your private catalog \n\nComplete the following steps to import a version of your software to your private catalog.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character.

If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-1659-3917", "score": 24.168016, "text": "\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03353-5263-7331", "score": 18.436346, "text": "\nItalian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English.

If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"}]}

It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi.

It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

For example, you can now expect the same confidence score for the following two inputs: ik ben een kleine krijger? and ik ben een kleine krijger. In this example, the question mark (?) doesn't affect the confidence score.\n\nImproved enhanced intent detection\n: The exact match in enhanced intent detection now better handles small differences between training examples and runtime utterances when the differences do not change the meaning of a sentence.\n\nFor example, suppose in your training examples, covid-19 is in the covid intent and @doctortype_facilitytype around Palm Beach is in the find_provide_master intent. In this example, the @doctortype_facilitytype direct entity reference contains entity values, including hospital. At run time, covid19 is predicted as 100% confident for the covid intent, and hospital around palm beach is predicted as 100% confident for the find_provide_master intent.\n\nThis update applies to the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, and the universal language model.

The model indicates the language in which the audio is spoken and the rate at which it is sampled. Next-generation models have higher throughput than the previous-generation models, so the service can return transcriptions more quickly. Next-generation models also provide noticeably better transcription accuracy.\n\nWhen you use next-generation models, the service analyzes audio bidirectionally. Using deep neural networks, the model analyzes and extracts information from the audio. The model then evaluates the information forwards and backwards to predict the transcription, effectively \"listening\" to the audio twice.\n\nWith the additional information and context afforded by bidirectional analysis, the service can make smarter hypotheses about the words spoken in the audio. Despite the added analysis, recognition with next-generation models is more efficient than with previous-generation models, so the service delivers results faster and with more accuracy. Most next-generation models also offer a low-latency option to receive results even faster, though low latency might impact transcription accuracy.\n\nIn addition to providing greater transcription accuracy, the models have the ability to hypothesize words that are not in the base language model and that it has not encountered in training. This capability can decrease the need for customization of domain-specific terms. A model does not need to contain a specific vocabulary term to predict that word.\n\n\n\n* For an overview of the next-generation models and their technology, see [Next-Generation Watson Speech to Text](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-speech-services/next-generation-watson-speech-to-text-650fd66d95d0).\n* For more information about the technology that underlies the next-generation models, see [Advancing RNN Transducer Technology for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09935).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng"}]}

An advanced authentication event happens when you issue tokens for advanced security features.\n\nBy default, advanced features are disabled. You incur an extra charge when you enable them. For example, if you obtain 10,000 access tokens, then you turn on password policy management and obtain 10,000 more.

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions. This is typically defined as a DR architecture.\n\nThe benefits of using a [DR orchestrator](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-cloud-resiliency-orchestrator) are covered in the context of a cloud environment and its fast changing behavior. You might require several integrations with management tools and services in IBM Cloud\u00ae.

We recommend that you verify possible changes or additional features that might apply to your environment.\n\n\n\n General disaster recovery strategy \n\nThe approach to defining your DR strategy needs to be systematic and start with the application or service, which is defined as a set of compute resources, for example Kubernetes apps, virtual machines, services, and more, that make up a business application.\n\nWhile a holistic approach might be wanted, the reality is that each business application (cloud service) is independent, with its own", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-dr"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07923-34167-35545", "score": 16.39153, "text": "\n12. Implement business continuity and disaster recovery \n\nRequirement: Implement a system for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR). Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) metrics for essential business functions. Implement your application so that the metrics are achieved.\n\nPurpose & value: Unfortunately, disasters occur that can make some or all of the data centers in a region unavailable. To avoid data loss, you must ensure all important data is backed up to a separate multizone region that can be used to restore service. However, your consumers must be able to opt out of having their data stored in the alternate region based on their data residency requirements.\n\nIn addition, you must follow best practices for BCDR as defined by the specific managed services that you use. For example, Direct Link, Hyper Protect Crypto Services, etc.\n\nImplementation guidance:\n\n\n\n* [VPC reference architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-bcdr)\n* [Satellite reference architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-bcdr)\n\n\n\nMost Relevant Controls:\n\n\n\nTable 12.

If you require historical metrics for auditing purposes, backup the metrics regularly by querying the metrics from the service and storing them at a remote backup site.\n\n\n\n Manual recovery of the service \n\nIf a regional disaster occurs, the recovery time of the service depends on the recovery time for the region. To minimize the downtime of the service and impact to your business, you could implement a manual failover to switch to another region while the region is being restored. To reduce the time to get up and running in a new location, consider using access groups to manage permissions working with the service, and backup the monitoring metadata of each instance. You should backup your alerts, notifications, dashboards and team definitions on a regular basis.\n\nHow to continue working while a DR site is rebuilt?\n\nIf the applications and services that you are monitoring through a monitoring instance are all co-located in the same region, then you must wait for the region to be available again for business.\n\nIf you have deployed monitoring agents on your systems, and those systems are not impacted by the regional failure, you may choose to redirect metrics to other instances of monitoring in a different region.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server. This capability allows you to decentralize the management of a large domain (such as ibm.com).\n\nA custom domain name server allows you to utilize the DNS provider's servers with the customized reference name of your own domain. For example, you can define your name server to be ns1.cloud.ibm.com instead of ns1.acme.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally 'sign' DNS data so you can be assured it is valid.

If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet.

For example, to allow more bandwidth for volumes, you can apportion the previous example in equal allocations:\n\n\n\n* Volumes: 2,000 Mbps.\n* Network: 2,000 Mbps.\n\n\n\nHowever, before you change the volume/networking bandwidth ratio, be sure to evaluate your instance's network bandwidth requirements. Make sure that the new bandwidth allocation does not have negative effects on your instance\u2019s network performance.\n\nExtending the example for multiple volumes, the bandwidth looks like this:\n\n\n\n* Total allocation for volumes is 2,000 Mbps,\n* Less boot volume minimum allocation, 393 Mbps,\n* Remaining bandwidth for data volumes: 1,607 Mbps.\n\n\n\nThe volume bandwidth that is available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes. For example, if you have an instance with four identical attached volumes but you are using only one volume, then that volume can get only the bandwidth that is assigned to it. The volume in use can't access extra bandwidth that is assigned to the unused volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n Unattached volume bandwidth versus attached volume bandwidth \n\nWhen you create a stand-alone (unattached) block storage data volume, the volume bandwidth is assigned based on volume capacity, IOPS, and volume profile. The API response for a GET /volume/{id} call shows the bandwidth for an unattached volume like the following example.\n\n{\n\"active\": true,\n\"bandwidth\": 640,\n\"busy\": false,\n\"capacity\": 500,\n\"created_at\": \"2021-08-08T06:26:17Z\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-bandwidth"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01232-4496-6574", "score": 18.975983, "text": "\nWhen the volume is canceled, the request is followed by a 24-hour reclaim wait period.

Said differently, two hosts connected to a volume with 6000 IOPS share that 6000 IOPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the volume need to be pre-warmed to achieve expected throughput? \n\nPre-warming is not needed. You can observe the specified throughput immediately upon provisioning the volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can more throughput be achieved if a faster Ethernet connection is used? \n\nThroughput limits are set at a per-volume level. That limit cannot be increased by using a faster Ethernet connection. However, with a slower Ethernet connection, your bandwidth can be a potential bottleneck.\n\n\n\n\n\n Do firewalls and security groups impact performance? \n\nIt's best to run storage traffic on a VLAN, which bypasses the firewall.

The maximum bandwidth capacity is determined by the instance profile that you select during instance provisioning. For example, a bx2-2x8 balanced server profile allows a total instance bandwidth of 4,000 Mbps (4 Gbps). The initial storage and network bandwidth allocation depends on what you set by using the API or by the instance profile you selected.\n\nThe maximum bandwidth of a volume is the highest potential bandwidth that can be allocated to the volume when it is attached to an instance. In cases where the total maximum bandwidth of attached volumes exceeds the amount that is available on the instance, the bandwidth for each volume attachment is set proportionally. The bandwidth is allocated based on the corresponding volume's maximum bandwidth.\n\nFor example, for the bx2-2x8 profile you might have:\n\n\n\n* Volumes: 1,000 Mbps,\n* Network: 3,000 Mbps.\n\n\n\nTo ensure reasonable boot times, a minimum of 393 Mbps is allocated to the primary boot volume.

For example, if you specified a context variable, such as \"color\":\"FFFFFF\", then the hex color code (FFFFFF) would be treated as an intent. Your assistant would check whether an intent named FFFFFF was detected in the user's input, and if not, would replace FFFFFF with false.

For example, We are the #1 seller of lobster rolls in Maine. You no longer need to escape the symbol in a text response.\n\nThis change does not apply to node or condtional response conditions. Any strings that begin with a number sign (#) which are specified in conditions continue to be treated as intent references.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

If you require backup capabilities, you need to configure your virtual server backup in your own responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n What is the purpose of the internal IP address? \n\nYou must use the internal IP address when you connect to a virtual server from another virtual server, which is in the same virtual LAN (VLAN).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I provide my applications in high availability? \n\nDo not rely on just one virtual server instance. Instead, run your application on multiple instances in combination with a load balancer to ensure high availability.\n\nIdeally, these virtual servers are spread across multiple regions and data centers. With Hyper Protect Virtual Servers, virtual servers are provided within three regions (us-south, eu-de, au-syd) and nine data centers (Dallas 10, Dallas 12, Dallas 13, Frankfurt 02, Frankfurt 04, Frankfurt 05,Sydney 01, Sydney 04, Sydney 05, Washington 04, Washington 06, and Washington 07).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I have more than five virtual servers within one data center? \n\nCurrently, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers supports only five virtual server instances per account in each data center. To provision more instances, you can use multiple accounts or data centers, or both.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is a virtual server available 24 / 7? \n\nThe virtual server is running on infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Before maintenance, stop the virtual servers. You are notified about maintenance schedules in advance. Service availability is defined within the [IBM Cloud\u00ae Service Description](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/pdf/6605-17/$file/i126-6605-17_06-2019_en_US.pdf).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does the data center have an impact on performance and reliability of a virtual server? \n\nNo, all of the data centers are of the same quality.

The core network services that are offered by NSX are:\n\n\n\n Logical switches \n\nA cloud deployment or a virtual data center might have various applications across multiple tenants. These applications and tenants require isolation from each other for security, fault isolation, and avoiding overlapping IP addressing issues. The NSX logical switch creates logical broadcast domains or segments (VXLAN vWires) to which an application or tenant virtual machine can be logically wired. This feature allows for flexibility and speed of deployment while still providing all the characteristics of a physical network's broadcast domains (VLANs) without physical Layer 2 sprawl. Logical switches allow for thousands of tenant networks to be provisioned onto a single IBM Cloud private network (VLAN). A logical switch is distributed and can span arbitrarily large compute clusters, even across pods within the same data center. This distribution allows for virtual machine mobility within the data center without limitations of physical Layer 2 (VLAN) boundaries across pods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logical routers \n\nDynamic routing provides the necessary forwarding information between Layer 2 broadcast domains (VXLAN, vWires, Logical Switches). This routing decreases Layer 2 broadcast domains and improve network efficiency and scale. NSX extends this intelligence where the workloads reside for providing East-West routing functions. This extension allows more direct virtual machine to virtual machine communication without the costly or timely need to extend hops. NSX also provides North-South connectivity inbound and outbound of IBM Cloud data centers, thus enabling tenants to access public networks securely and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logical firewall \n\nLogical firewall provides security mechanisms for dynamic virtual data centers. The Distributed Firewall component of an NSX Logical Firewall allows users to segment virtual data center entities (virtual servers), vCenter objects (data centers and hosts), and traditional networking attributes like IP addresses and VLANs.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmware?topic=vmware-nsx-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14480-2803-4773", "score": 16.94208, "text": "\nService Router Provides gateway services<br><br><br><br> * NAT<br> * Load Balancer<br> * Gateway firewall<br> * North-south routing<br> * VPN<br> * DNS Forwarding<br> * DHCP<br><br><br> \n\n\n\nSome key NSX-T concepts do not correspond to NSX-V functions. You need to review the following concepts so you can understand the NSX-T design implementation.\n\n\n\n* A gateway cluster is one or more VMs or physical machines that participate in an NSX-T virtual fabric. They are endpoints for the overlay network transport zones and VLAN backed transport zones. A gateway cluster can support a single T0 gateway instance.\n* A T0 gateway is a virtual router instance, but not a VM. Multiple T0 gateway instances can run within a gateway cluster each with its own routing table and functions. A gateway cluster must exist before you can create a T0 router instance.\n* A transport zone can span endpoints across different platforms and multiple vSphere vCenter instances. No cross-vCenter linked NSX is required. Transport zones can be excluded from specific endpoints.\n* Uplink failover order is created independent of a particular logical switch as they are created in profiles as \u201cUplink Profiles\u201d and are applied to a particular logical switch based on VLAN. It's possible to need a differing failover order or load balancing of physical uplinks for the same VLAN. Therefore, the uplink profile for a particular VLAN can contain multiple entries for \u201cTeaming\u201d with different a failover order and load balancing. When you assign the uplink profile to a logical switch, the specific teaming profile is chosen.\n* The manager VM and the controller VM function are combined, which results in three NSX-T manager VMs being deployed. If on the same subnet, they use an internal network load balancer. If across different subnets, an external load balancer is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Resource requirements \n\nIn this design, the NSX-T controller Manager VMs are deployed on the management cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-nsx-t-design"}]}

You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16295-7-1721", "score": 20.551758, "text": "\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "score": 22.78261, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 20.362698, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16375-2380-4419", "score": 20.302513, "text": "\nsetTimeout(function(){const t=document.createElement('script');t.src=\"https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/versions/\" + (window.watsonAssistantChatOptions.clientVersion || 'latest') + \"/WatsonAssistantChatEntry.js\";document.head.appendChild(t);});\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\nShow more\n\nIn your app, make sure you include logic to hide your web chat launching mechanism when the device is offline. If the device goes offline in the middle of a conversation, appropriate error messages and retries occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a JavaScript bridge \n\nIn some situations, your mobile application might need to communicate with the Watson Assistant web chat. For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16375-7-1735", "score": 20.206116, "text": "\nAdding the web chat to your mobile application \n\nIf you have a mobile application built on a mobile framework such as iOS, Android, or React Native, you can use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to communicate between your app and the Watson Assistant web chat.\n\nUsing WebViews with a JavaScript bridge is a common pattern with a similar implementation for all mobile frameworks.\n\n\n\n Including the web chat as a WebView \n\nYou can include the web chat interface as part of a page of your mobile app, or as a separate panel that your app opens. In either case, you must host an HTML page that includes the web chat embed script, and then include that page as a WebView in your app.\n\nIn the embed script, use the showLauncher option to hide the web chat launcher icon, and the openChatByDefault option to open the web chat automatically when the page loads. In most cases, you will also want to use the hideCloseButton option and use the native controls of your app to control how the web chat page or panel closes. For more information about the configuration options you can specify in the embed script, see the [Web chat API reference](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration).\n\nThe following example shows an embed script that includes these configuration options:\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n</head>\n<body>\n<script>\nwindow.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {\n// A UUID like '1d7e34d5-3952-4b86-90eb-7c7232b9b540' included in the embed code provided in Watson Assistant.\nintegrationID: \"YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID\",\n// Your assistants region e.g. 'us-south', 'us-east', 'jp-tok' 'au-syd', 'eu-gb', 'eu-de', etc.\nregion: \"YOUR_REGION\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-2916-4646", "score": 19.62515, "text": "\n// Returns a signed JWT signed with the RS256 algorithm.\nfunction createJWT() {\nconst payload = {\nsub: 'some-user-id', // Identifies user for billing purposes\n};\n// The \"expiresIn\" option adds an \"exp\" claim to the payload.\nreturn jwt.sign(payload,\nprocess.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY,\n{ algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '1h' });\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the web chat to include JWTs \n\nNow that you have implemented a function to generate a signed JWT, you must update your web chat instance to include the signed JWT with each message it sends. After you enable web chat security, any messages that are not signed with the proper private key are rejected.\n\nIn your website HTML, update the web chat embed script to specify a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever the existing JWT expires. The simplest way to do this is to subscribe to the [identityTokenExpired](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-eventsidentityexpired) event and generate a new JWT when that event is received. The identityTokenExpired event is fired in both of the following situations:\n\n\n\n* At the beginning of a new session, if no JWT was provided using the identityToken configuration option.\n* When the previously specified JWT expires.\n\n\n\nIn your onLoad event handler, use the [on()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodson) instance method to subscribe to the identityTokenExpired event.\n\nIn the callback, call the function on your server that you implemented to generate a new JWT. Then use the identityToken parameter of the event to specify the new JWT, as in this example:\n\ninstance.on({ type: 'identityTokenExpired',\nhandler: async function(event) {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16373-1375-3149", "score": 19.530373, "text": "\nCreate a handler for the [history:begin](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-eventshistorybegin) event, which is fired when the web chat is reloaded from the session history.

Create a function that converts the messages saved in the messages list to the format you want to provide in the downloaded file. Note that this conversion needs to accommodate any response types that the conversation might include (such as text, images, options, or transfers to a human agent).\n\nIn this example, we convert the messages into a CSV file format that can be opened with an application such as Microsoft Excel. The first column in each line is a label that indicates whether the message originated from the customer (You) or from the assistant (Lendyr).\n\nThis function relies on a helper function (createDownloadText) that formats the text for each line. You can see the implementation of this helper function in the [full example](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/webchat/examples/download-history).\n\nfunction createDownload() {\nconst downloadLines = [createDownloadText('From', 'Message')];\n\nmessages.forEach(message => {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-download-transcript"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16379-1535-3159", "score": 19.387234, "text": "\nThis handler modifies the payload of outgoing message events to assign a value to a context variable called User_Name.\n\nWe want to set the user name only once at the beginning of the conversation.

In a production assistant, you might retrieve the customer's name from a user profile on your website.\n\nfunction preSendHandler(event) {\n// Only do this on messages that request the welcome message.\nif (event.data.input && event.data.input.text === '') {\nevent.data.context.skills['actions skill'] = event.data.context.skills['actions skill'] || {};\nevent.data.context.skills['actions skill'].skill_variables = event.data.context.skills['actions skill'].skill_variables || {};\nevent.data.context.skills['actions skill'].skill_variables.User_Name = 'Cade';\n}\n}\n2.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n  Automatic retrain of old skills and workspaces \n\nWatson Assistant was released as a service in July 2016. Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version. If the version you had selected is no longer supported, Watson Assistant retrains using the version labeled as Previous. This means that your assistant will automatically have the supported technologies applied. Assistants that have been modified during the previous 6 months will not be affected. For more information, see [Algorithm version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version).\n\nIn most cases, this retraining will be seamless from an end-user point of view. The same inputs will result in the same actions, intents, and entities being detected. In some cases, the retraining might cause changes in accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-auto-retrain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16324-3229-5312", "score": 17.513462, "text": "\nChoose a narrow set of user goals first. If you start small and choose the goals with the highest impact first, you'll have room and time to grow the expertise of your assistant. After your assistant is live, the built-in metrics of active user conversations help you understand what your customers are asking about, how well your assistant is able to meet their needs, and what to focus on next.\n\n\n\n\n\n 3. Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Connect to content sources \n\nThe answer to common questions might already be documented somewhere in your organization's technical information. Plan whether you want to connect the assistant to existing content sources by taking an inventory of relevant help content (for example, product information, knowledge articles, FAQs) available to your customers.\n\nYou can give your assistant access to this information by adding a [search integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-search-add) to your assistant. The search integration uses IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery to return smart answers to natural language questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.

For example, you might need to migrate data from old instances to new instances or update the credentials that are used for your app if you delete the Cloud Foundry alias. Applications that make a direct call to the API of a service that is migrated need to update the API call to use either an IAM API key or access token.\n\n\n\n1. Open the More actions menu.\n2.

They teach your assistant to explicitly not answer utterances of this type.\n\nWhile testing your dialog, you can mark an intent as irrelevant directly from the Try it out pane.\n\n![Mark as irrelevant screen capture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/irrelevant.png)\n\nBe certain before you designate an input as irrelevant.\n\n\n\n* There is no way to access or change the inputs from the user interface later.\n* The only way to reverse the identification of an input as being irrelevant is to use the same input in a test integration channel, and then explicitly assign it to an intent.\n\n\n\nOften there are subjects that you expect customers to ask and that you want your assistant to address eventually, but that you aren't ready to fully implement yet. Instead of adding those topics as counterexamples which can be hard to find later, capture the customer input examples as new intents. But don't link dialog nodes to the intents until you're ready. If customers ask about one of these topics in the meantime, the anything_else node is triggered to explain that the assistant can't help with the current request, but can help them with other things.\n\n\n\n Irrelevance detection \n\nThe irrelevance detection feature helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore.

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\nTo learn more about creating intents, watch the following 2 1/2-minute video.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03109-4-2250", "score": 9.61824, "text": "\nThis documentation for the classic Watson Assistant experience has moved.
