Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents.

Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test?

Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When you place an object in the bucket, a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the time of the object write.\n\nIf your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and Retain Until Date, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.\n\nLike all other Object Lock settings, the Retain Until Date applies to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.\n\nImagine an object that is 60 days into a 90-day retention period, and you overwrite that object with the same name and a two year retention period. The operation will succeed and a new version of the object with a two year retention period is created. Meanwhile, after 30 more days the original version is eligible for deletion.\n\n\n\n\n\n Extending a retention period \n\nTo extend the retention period of an object, simply send a request to set a new, longer, retention period.

However, legal holds are more flexible and don't have a defined temporal component. Instead they simply remain in effect until removed. Legal holds can be freely placed and removed by any user who has the cloud-object-storage.object.put_object_lock_legal_hold and cloud-object-storage.object.put_object_lock_legal_hold_version actions.\n\nLegal holds have the additional benefit of acting as method for applying indefinite retention on an object.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04939-62476-64507","score":0.6740022898,"text":"\nThe retention period of an object can only be extended.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-updates"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08016-1485-3419","score":0.670787096,"text":"\n[Object Storage](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage) stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations. Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\nAll Object Storage buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by Hyper Protect Crypto Services. For more information, see [Encryption at rest](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-at-rest). In addition, a geographically separate region should be used as an [alternative storage site](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-bcdryour-workloads-requirements-alternate-storage-site). This means you should use [cross region resiliency](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpointsendpoints-geo) for all of your Object Storage buckets.\n\nTo start working with Object Storage, see the following instructions:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_15561-7-2436","score":0.6693097949,"text":"\nAbout instance storage \n\nInstance storage is a set of one or more solid-state drives (full or isolated partial storage spaces) attached to your virtual server instance when the instance is provisioned. Instance storage is close to the compute resources of the virtual server and on a high-speed communication channel independent from the network. An instance storage disk provides fast, affordable, temporary storage to improve the performance of cloud native workloads with scratch space, caching buffers, or a place for replicated data. The data that is stored on instance storage is ephemeral, which means that the data is tied directly to the instance lifecycle. The instance storage disk is automatically created and destroyed with the instance. Instance storage data is not lost when an instance is only rebooted.\n\nInstance storage is a complementary storage technology to the boot and block storage volumes for data offered with VPC. Some examples of use cases for instance storage disks are:\n\n\n\n* Distributed File Systems: Technologies such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which do triplication of the data across multiple servers. These technologies can improve read bandwidth and retain reliability by maintaining multiple copies of the data. It is recommended that at least three copies of the data, ideally across availability zones, are maintained when using Instance Storage for these workloads.\n* Transactional jobs: Transaction processing usually creates a significant amount of temporary files. Instance Storage is a great place to temporarily store that data while the transactions are processed, with the result stored persistently on a data volume.\n* Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Improve performance for large geographically distributed applications with instance storage for fast, low cost, local data caching.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lifecycle of instance storage \n\nThe lifecycle of instance storage is critical to understand. Without a proper understanding of its temporary nature, workloads could experience data loss.\n\nThe instance storage space is allocated and attached to the virtual server instance at the time of provisioning. It is an integral and inseparable element of the virtual server instance. If you reboot your instance (either from its operating system or through an IBM Cloud Management interface), the instance storage data is retained and the instance is reconnected to its original disks.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-instance-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14378-13964-14975","score":0.6690816283,"text":"\nYou can allocate and mount more file shares across all hosts for your workloads at the time of purchase or later within the console.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05166-7-1684","score":0.732961297,"text":"\nRelease notes for Object Storage \n\nNews on the latest releases from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage provide the updates you need on all things related to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\n\n\n 14 June 2023 \n\nNew location!\n: Buckets can now be created in a Regional (MZR) configuration in Madrid, Spain.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will create only one CA at a time.\n\nWatch the following video to learn about the process to create the peer's organization and the peer (for video tutorials on how to create an ordering service and a channel, see [video series](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/series\/ibm-blockchain-platform-console-video-series\/):\n\nVideo transcript\n\nHello everyone, and welcome to this demonstration of how to create a peer using the IBM Blockchain platform console. I\u2019ll be following the process from the IBM Blockchain platform documentation, which you can see here. At the end of this tutorial, you will have created this structure, representing the components related to org1. In our next video, we\u2019ll create an ordering service. And after that, a channel, to complete the infrastructure of our network.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll be using recommended values for the various fields in the UI. These are the same values you\u2019ll find in the docs, which are cataloged in tables for the various tasks. These values are not mandatory, but if you\u2019re using the console for the first time, we do recommended them. In cases where you have to reenter a value, for example an enroll ID and secret, which are not stored in the console, you will be able to refer to the tables in the documentation to remember what you entered. If you do choose different values, make sure to write them down somewhere.\n\nAlright, so let\u2019s get started creating that peer. If you're unfamiliar with Hyperledger Fabric, which the IBM Blockchain Platform is based on, you might not realize you have to create a Certificate Authority before you create a peer. This is because before we can create a peer, we have to create some identities. These identities allow a network entity, whether it\u2019s an admin or a node, to sign its actions using a certificate. Those certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, also known as a CA. Therefore, our first step in creating a peer is to create a CA and use it to register identities for the peer admin and for the peer itself.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12559-1521-3753","score":0.6555140018,"text":"\nTo create an enterprise, you must be the account owner or have the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nCreating an enterprise from an account and importing existing accounts cannot be undone. This tutorial is provided as an example of the steps you can follow to set up an enterprise by department, but you should carefully plan your enterprise structure around your organization's needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Create the enterprise \n\nEnterprises are created from an existing Subscription account. When you create the enterprise, the account is added to the enterprise hierarchy. Billing transitions to being managed by the enterprise, but its users and resources remain the same and are completely unaffected. For a complete description of account impacts, see [Creating an enterprise](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-create-enterprise).\n\n\n\n1. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Enterprise, and click Create.\n2. Enter the name of your company, such as Example Corp, to identify your enterprise.\n3. Enter your company's domain, such as examplecorp.com.\n4. Review the information about the impact to your account, and select I understand the impact to my account. Then, click Create. The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize). The second and third tier of the Example Corp. enterprise hierarchy contain the Marketing, Development, Sales, Design, and Engineering account groups.

So thank you for watching this video, and happy block chaining.\n\n\n\n Creating your peer organization's CA \n\nYour CA issues the certificates and private keys for your organization's admins, client applications, and nodes. These identities are not managed by IBM and the private keys are not stored in the console. They are only stored in your browser local storage. Therefore, make sure to export your identities and the MSP of your organization. If you attempt to access the console from a different machine or a different browser, you will need to import these identities and organization definitions.\n\nTo create the CA that will issue certificates for your first organization, perform the following steps in your console:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Nodes tab on the left and click Add Certificate Authority. The side panels will allow you to customize the CA that you want to create and the organization that this CA will issue keys for.\n2. In this tutorial, we're creating nodes, as opposed to importing them, so make sure the option to Create a Certificate Authority is selected. Then click Next.\n3. Use the side panel to give your CA a display name. Our recommended value for this CA is Org1 CA. Then give your CA admin credentials by specifying a CA administrator enroll ID of admin and a secret of adminpw. Again, these are recommended values.\n4.

This transition includes the following changes to the account.\n\n\n\n* For Subscription accounts that are added, the account type is changed to Pay-As-You-Go. This change reflects that the account does not have its own subscriptions, but it still has full access to production-ready, billable services.\n* Subscriptions and promotions from each account are moved to the enterprise account, where they become part of the credit pool.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

Figure to show the hierarchy of Products, Plans, and APIs. ![Figure to show the hierarchy of Products, Plans, and APIs.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/78bb71851d95d7580503eb9ba10cf3ae31490ade\/apiconnect\/images\/plan_product_hierarchy.png)\n\nYou can create Plans only within Products, and these Products are then published in a Catalog. A lifecycle manager can then control the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans through the API Manager. Through the Developer Portal, the customer is then able to subscribe to one of the Plans that is available to them, as determined in the API Manager. If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03268-3577-4942","score":0.6281985641,"text":"\n* [Disambiguation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-sms-actionsdialog-sms-actions-disambiguation)\n\n\n\n\n\n Options list \n\nThe dialog supports an option response type, which shows the customer multiple options to choose from.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02900-21167-22769","score":0.7183321714,"text":"\n* [Enabling disambiguation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambig-enable)\n* [Choosing nodes](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-choose-nodes)\n* [Handling none of the above](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-handle-none)\n* [Testing disambiguation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtimedialog-runtime-disambig-test)\n\n\n\n\n\n Disambiguation example \n\nFor example, you have a dialog that has two nodes with intent conditions that address cancellation requests.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09988-7-1841","score":0.6322788,"text":"\nQueries \n\n\n\n Recent queries \n\nOn the page, you can see the most recent 2000 queries.\n\nYou do not need to have the administrator privileges to view recent queries.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST \/{db}\/_find](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST \/{db}\/_index](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00460-34449-36370","score":0.7809543014,"text":"\nQuery (_find endpoint) improved\n: IBM Cloudant Query now uses a new method to select an index.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine\/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ra-5"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06063-53153-55320","score":0.6898739934,"text":"\nImage Vulnerability Scanner: By default, Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities.

Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI\/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07578-365833-367834","score":0.7118012309,"text":"\nThe images that are not eligible are still displayed, but they do not count toward the total number of images that is set in the retention policy and are not removed.\n* What regions are available?\n\n What regions are available? \n\nTo find out about the regions that are available for IBM Cloud Container Registry, see [Regions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewregistry_regions).\n* How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost?\n\n How much does Vulnerability Advisor cost? \n\nThe cost of Vulnerability Advisor is built into the pricing for IBM Cloud Container Registry.

For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor.

Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team. Enable [content trust](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontentregistry_trustedcontent) so that images must be approved by a trusted signer before they can be pushed to the container registry. Then, [install the open source Portieris project](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/portieris) admission controller to block container deployments from unsigned images.\n3. Regularly scan running containers:. Even if you deployed a container from an image that passes the vulnerability check, the operating system or binaries that run in the container might get vulnerable over time. To protect your app, you must ensure that running containers are regularly scanned so that you can detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Depending on the app, to add extra security, you can establish a job that takes down vulnerable containers after they are detected.\n\n\n\nYou can use the built-in container registry to automate the container image build process from your source code in an external source repository to your internal registry. However, images are not automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when they are pushed to the internal registry.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

For existing accounts, provisioning scripts are managed within the IBM Cloud\u00ae console. During the ordering process, you can manually enter scripts for new accounts or scripts that are not yet tracked.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a cloud-init enabled image and provide user data to automatically perform configuration tasks or run scripts.

After provisioning, an administrator must run the script manually on the device. Scripts that are associated with an HTTPS URL are downloaded and run automatically. Provisioning scripts are currently available on only Linux operating systems (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Debian, or Ubuntu), and Windows and FreeBSD.

The strongSwan VPN pod and the routes daemon set can be deployed into kube-system or any other namespace. If the strongSwan VPN is not deployed into the specified namespace, then the vpn-strongswan-ping-remote-ip-1 Helm test fails. This failure is expected and acceptable. The test pings the remote.privateIPtoPing private IP address of the on-premises VPN gateway from a pod which is not in the namespace that has direct access to the remote subnet. However, the VPN pod is still able to forward traffic to pods in the namespaces that do have routes to the remote subnet, and traffic can still flow correctly. The VPN state is still ESTABLISHED and pods in the specified namespace can connect over the VPN.\n* The Calico global network policies in the following steps don't prevent Kubernetes pods that use host networking from sending and receiving data over the VPN. When a pod is configured with host networking, the app running in the pod can listen on the network interfaces of the worker node that it is on. These host networking pods can exist in any namespace. To determine which pods have host networking, run oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide and look for any pods that don't have a 172.30.0.0\/16 pod IP address. If you want to prevent host networking pods from sending and receiving data over the VPN, you can set the following options in your values.yaml deployment file: local.subnet: 172.30.0.0\/16 and enablePodSNAT: false.

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

Follow the instructions on the Live agent tab in the web chat configuration for setting up those systems.

This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06004-15614-17542","score":0.65828228,"text":"\nSecrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.\n\nBoth resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.\n\nConfigmap\n: Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment.

Jane \u2013 our \"E dev\" here \u2013 needs again to have access to that development repo that she's referring to earlier. Let's go ahead and call this, maybe it's GitHub.

They're interacting with the development repo to do that. To gain that access again, coming back to the need, we have authorization and permission. How it's going to communicate, specifically in this circumstance, is by giving it user credentials.

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Deployment of Bare Metal Servers in a network environment with a PXE setup (usually involves running a DHCP and TFTP daemon) and configure the new servers BIOS to boot from the network adapter. For the no OS option to work properly, PXE setup needs to be in the same VLAN as the Bare Metal Servers, or DHCP forwarding needs to be used.\n\nIt might be necessary to open a support case to request that the switch ports be regrouped in basic mode for this option to work. This request is necessary because the PXE protocol doesn't require compatibility with link aggregation (LACP), which is now a standard capability to provide redundancy.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-no-os"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13993-0-451","score":0.6807230115,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Database tools \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae offers optional at-cost and no-cost database tool products for both Virtual Servers and Bare Metal Servers deployments.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00029-8568-9861","score":0.7101297975,"text":"\n\"spark.hive.metastore.client.auth.mode\":\"PLAIN\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.use.SSL\":\"true\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.stats.autogather\":\"false\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hive.metastore.client.plain.username\":\"<CHANGEME-CRN-DATA-ENGINE-INSTANCE>\",\n for spark 3.3\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"\/opt\/ibm\/jdk\/lib\/security\/cacerts\",\n for spark 3.1, spark 3.2\n\"spark.hive.metastore.truststore.path\":\"file:\/\/\/opt\/ibm\/jdk\/jre\/lib\/security\/cacerts\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars\":\"\/opt\/ibm\/connectors\/data-engine\/hms-client\/\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.version\":\"3.0\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.warehouse.dir\":\"file:\/\/\/tmp\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\":\"hive\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"spark.hadoop.metastore.catalog.default\":\"spark\"\n},\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"application\": \"cos:\/\/mybucket.ALIAS NAME\/select_query_data_engine.py\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\n}\nShow more\n\nParameter values:\n\n\n\n* ALIAS NAME: specify the data engine endpoint for your region.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":0.7063522935,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.6511025429,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Encouraging users to pick predefined options from a set of buttons is less like a real conversation, and decreases your ability to learn what users really want to do. When you let real users ask for things in their own words, you can use the input to train the system and derive better intents.\n* Avoid using a bunch of nodes when one node will do.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with \/cdn-cgi\/challenge-platform\/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action. Enter (cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed) into the Expression preview section as a singular rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations \n\n\n\n* If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n\n\n\n* Ensure

tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules.

With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":0.7201809883,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04175-0-1274","score":0.7018719316,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Machine learning models \n\nEnterprise customers can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.\n\nTo enable auto-updates:\n\n\n\n1.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16495-7-2129","score":0.7031123042,"text":"\nMaking machine learning model improvements \n\nAfter you determine areas in which the model is having trouble, take steps to improve its performance.\n\n\n\n Creating model versions \n\nAfter you create a machine learning model, you can take a snapshot to keep a backup version of the current resources in case you want to restore the resources in a future iteration.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nThe F1 score provides an indication of the quality of the model.

The universal language model uses a default algorithm.\n\n\n\n Automatic retraining \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nWatson Assistant was released as a service in July 2016. Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version. If the version you had selected is no longer supported, Watson Assistant retrains using the version labeled as Previous. This means that your assistant will automatically have the supported technologies applied. Assistants that have been modified during the previous 6 months will not be affected.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-algorithm-version"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary. Figure 1 shows how you can subdivide a virtual private cloud with subnets and each subnet can reach the public internet.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure showing how a VPC can be subdivided with subnets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/f02b9c9adcbb7328d95a45e105cec371d50f15eb\/vpc\/images\/vpc-experience-simple.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM VPC connectivity and security\n\n\n\n\n\n Terminology \n\nTo work with your VPC, review the basic concepts of region and zone as they apply to your deployment.\n\n\n\n Regions \n\nA region is an abstraction that is related to the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed. Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12170-1498-3591","score":0.7203510404,"text":"\nVPC VPC provides you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud. \n zones You must have one VPC subnet for each zone in your cluster.

You cannot change the number of IP addresses that a VPC subnet has. \n master node Controls and manages a set of worker nodes (workloads runtime) and resembles a cluster in Kubernetes. \n cluster A cluster contains a control plane and one or more compute machines, or nodes. Nodes run the applications and workloads. \n worker node Add the zone to your worker pool. When you add a zone to a worker pool, the worker nodes that are defined in your worker pool are provisioned in the zone and considered for future workload scheduling. \n\n\n\nYou can add worker nodes and pool to your VPC cluster by using a ibm_container_vpc_worker_pool provider resource.\n\nThe costs are incurred based on your resource usage.

If you have large amounts of confidential data, it is often helpful to use a Key Management System to assist in keeping your data secure. Key Protect uses the envelope encryption technique to keep your data resilient.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match. A third party cannot use the hash without a copy of the original data.\n\nIt is important to be aware with this option that while Orgs A and B cannot see the actual ledger data because it is hashed, they are still able to see that Orgs C and D are transacting and can see the volume of transactions that are occurring between them.\n\nAlso, consider that data inside a private data collection can be purged from the peers that store it.

By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07967-7-2108","score":0.7991157174,"text":"\nWorking with virtual servers in VPC reference architecture \n\nThe primary compute option for the VPC reference architecture is [Virtual Servers for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-advanced-virtual-servers).

Using subnet and VLAN networking in one pod works well until you must scale up or have large virtual resource demands that require resources to be created between pods. (Adding appliances for VLAN spanning can get expensive and complicated!)\n\nIBM Cloud VPC adds a network orchestration layer that eliminates the pod boundary, creating increased capacity for scaling instances. The network orchestration layer handles all of the networking for all virtual server instances that are within a VPC across regions and zones. With the software-defined networking capabilities that VPC provides, you have more options for multi-vNIC instances and larger subnet sizes.\n\nTo review and start deploying compute resources, see the following topics:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

An application that provides file sharing will put security concepts into practice.\n\nNo application architecture is complete without a clear understanding of potential security risks and how to protect against such threats. Application data is a critical resource which can not be lost, compromised or stolen. Additionally, data should be protected at rest and in transit through encryption techniques. Encrypting data at rest protects information from disclosure even when it is lost or stolen. Encrypting data in transit (e.g. over the Internet) through methods such as HTTPS, SSL, and TLS prevents eavesdropping and so called man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nAuthenticating and authorizing users' access to specific resources is another common requirement for many applications. Different authentication schemes may need to be supported: customers and suppliers using social identities, partners from cloud-hosted directories, and employees from an organization\u2019s identity provider.\n\n\n\n Objectives \n\n\n\n* Encrypt content in storage buckets with your own encryption keys\n* Require users to authenticate before accessing an application\n* Monitor and audit security-related API calls and other actions across cloud services\n\n\n\nThe tutorial features a sample application that enables groups of users to upload files to a common storage pool and to provides access to those files via shareable links.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois\/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

This is performed using Data Security Broker Manager to enumerate the data schema and enable an encryption key mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Tokenization: \n\nData Security Broker supports length preserving and data type preserving tokenization method to anonymize data at the field level databases or in semi-structured data files.\n\n\n\n\n\n Record Level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker can be configured for record level encryption to support multiple keys within a single column that are mapped to respective data owners or entities. This encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Masking: \n\nData Security Broker can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration to external parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deployment Plans in IBM Cloud Data Data Security Broker: \n\nWhen you assign and customize default Data Protection Policies with Data Security Broker Manager, there are three options that you can choose to implement your data encryption policy:\n\n\n\n Save Policy: \n\nSave Policy option is selected by default. This option saves your selected data, but does not execute encryption or data protection on your database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new policy is saved to overwrite it. You can use the saved policy to deploy or migrate it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n Deploy Policy: \n\nDeploy Policy option saves your policy and deploys your configured Data Security Broker Shield as a proxy for the configured database.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12678-7-2410","score":0.6662138104,"text":"\nKnown issues (Limitations) \n\nUse this topic to find the details of the limitations that are applicable to the Data Security Broker software.\n\n\n\n Application-level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker encryption gives database applications a no-code way to implement application-level encryption. Application-level encryption can be implemented by including a database proxy that intercepts and encrypts sensitive data in accordance with the pre-established data protection policy.\n\nData Security Broker encryption has some restrictions, like any other approaches to the application-level encryption implementation. The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16727-1068047-1069909","score":0.6620926857,"text":"\nIf you manage your invoices through the IBM Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking Manage > Billing and usage, and selecting Invoices.

For more information, see [Building actions from a template](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-templates).\n\nChannel name variable\n: The Channel name integration variable lets you add step conditions using these channels: web chat, phone, SMS, WhatsApp, Slack, or Facebook Messenger.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers. Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.7076066732,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

So thank you for watching this video, and happy block chaining.\n\n\n\n Creating your peer organization's CA \n\nYour CA issues the certificates and private keys for your organization's admins, client applications, and nodes. These identities are not managed by IBM and the private keys are not stored in the console. They are only stored in your browser local storage. Therefore, make sure to export your identities and the MSP of your organization. If you attempt to access the console from a different machine or a different browser, you will need to import these identities and organization definitions.\n\nTo create the CA that will issue certificates for your first organization, perform the following steps in your console:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Nodes tab on the left and click Add Certificate Authority. The side panels will allow you to customize the CA that you want to create and the organization that this CA will issue keys for.\n2. In this tutorial, we're creating nodes, as opposed to importing them, so make sure the option to Create a Certificate Authority is selected. Then click Next.\n3. Use the side panel to give your CA a display name. Our recommended value for this CA is Org1 CA. Then give your CA admin credentials by specifying a CA administrator enroll ID of admin and a secret of adminpw. Again, these are recommended values.\n4. The Advanced deployment options are only available in paid clusters and can be safely ignored for purposes of this tutorial. For more information about these options, see the links below.\n\n\n\n* [Database and replica sets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-ha-caibp-console-build-ha-ca-create) (Creating an HA CA) This option is only available on paid clusters.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03921-79392-81466","score":0.6271538138,"text":"\nThis is where channel creation and management are handled.\n\nWhen you first navigate to this tab, it will be empty except for the Create channel and Join channel buttons. This is because you haven't created a channel and joined a peer to it yet.\n\n\n\n Creating the channel \n\nPerform the following steps from your console:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Channels tab.\n2. Click Create channel. The create channel panel will open. From here, you will perform all of the steps to create your channel.\n3. On the Prerequisites panel, you can decide whether or not you want to specify any Advanced channel configuration options. For more information about these options, see [Advanced channel deployment and management](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-governibp-console-govern). For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll assume you don't want to specify any advanced channel configuration options, so click Next.\n4. On the Channel details page, give your channel a name and specify the ordering service the channel will be hosted on. In this tutorial, our channel is called channel1 while the ordering service is called Ordering Service. Note: you will not be able to change the channel name or the ordering service it is hosted on later. Click Next.\n5. On the Organizations page, select the organizations that will be part of this channel. As we have only created one organization, this will be Org1 MSP (org1msp). After clicking Add, you can assign the organization a role on the channel. Because each channel must have at least one operator, make Org1 MSP (org1msp) an Operator.\n6. Next, choose a Channel update policy for the channel. This is the policy that will dictate how many organizations will have to approve updates to the channel configuration. Because this tutorial only involves creating a single organization, this policy should be 1 out of 1. As you add organizations to the channel, you should change this policy to reflect the needs of your use case. A sensible standard in a five organization channel is to use a majority of organizations.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03921-12512-14656","score":0.6224147081,"text":"\nEach organization needs a CA to issue its certificates, therefore we need to create two CAs.

I\u2019ll be following the process from the IBM Blockchain platform documentation, which you can see here. At the end of this tutorial, you will have created this structure, representing the components related to org1. In our next video, we\u2019ll create an ordering service. And after that, a channel, to complete the infrastructure of our network.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll be using recommended values for the various fields in the UI. These are the same values you\u2019ll find in the docs, which are cataloged in tables for the various tasks. These values are not mandatory, but if you\u2019re using the console for the first time, we do recommended them. In cases where you have to reenter a value, for example an enroll ID and secret, which are not stored in the console, you will be able to refer to the tables in the documentation to remember what you entered. If you do choose different values, make sure to write them down somewhere.\n\nAlright, so let\u2019s get started creating that peer. If you're unfamiliar with Hyperledger Fabric, which the IBM Blockchain Platform is based on, you might not realize you have to create a Certificate Authority before you create a peer. This is because before we can create a peer, we have to create some identities. These identities allow a network entity, whether it\u2019s an admin or a node, to sign its actions using a certificate. Those certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, also known as a CA. Therefore, our first step in creating a peer is to create a CA and use it to register identities for the peer admin and for the peer itself.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02882-5559-7278","score":0.620664537,"text":"\n[More icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/kabob.png) icon.\n\n\n\n* To create a peer node that is checked next if the condition for the existing node is not met, select Add node below.\n* To create a peer node that is checked before the condition for the existing node is checked, select Add node above.\n* To create a child node to the selected node, select Add child node.

If you've watched our videos on creating a peer and an ordering service, you should have a deployment that looks similar to this one, with one peer org, two CAs and an ordering service.\n\nAs with our previous videos, the steps we'll be going through today are from our Build a network tutorial in the IBM Blockchain Platform documentation. This tutorial will complete the structure you see here, with Org1, which we created in our first video, creating a channel run on our ordering service, which we created in our second video.\n\nIf you don't know what channels are, they're the place where transactions involving assets happen in the IBM Blockchain Platform. And because channels can be created with a subset of the members of a network, channels are also a powerful tool to enable privacy. Only the members of a channel will know about that channel and have access to its ledger, enabling the related business partners who form networks a space to execute deals that only they know about. Whatever the reason, the process for creating a channel is the same.\n\nSince we\u2019re creating a channel, you might be tempted to click over to the channels tab. But there's actually a step we need to do first, which is to add org1 to the consortium. Now what is the consortium? A consortium is the list of organizations that are allowed to create channels on a particular ordering service. Once an organization is added to this list, which is maintained by the admins of the ordering service, an organization will be able to create a channel. To do that, we must click into the Ordering Service and click Add Organization under the Consortium members header. Then we must select the org1msp, as this is our peer organization. Then click submit. Easy as that.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02602-6886-8639","score":0.6090709567,"text":"\nThe tool displays a number of messages as it creates the project directory and adds a number of directories and files to it.It also runs npm install to install all the project dependencies, as specified in package.json.

It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. The name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

Chaining conditions helps to structure larger dialog trees.\n\nAvoid choosing this option when configuring a jump-to from a conditional response that goes to a node situated above the current node in the dialog tree. Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog. Your assistant will go to the next sibling or back to root to check the conditions on those nodes, and will likely end up triggering this node again, which means the process will repeat itself.\n* Response: If the statement targets the response section of the selected dialog node, it is run immediately.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03273-13172-14845","score":0.7430840731,"text":"\nPlan Dialog nodes per skill \n\n Enterprise 100,000 \n Premium (legacy) 100,000 \n Plus 100,000 \n Trial 25,000 \n Lite 25,000 \n\n\n\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding a dialog node by its node ID \n\nYou can search for a dialog node by its node ID.

For example, you might group nodes that address questions about user accounts in a User account folder and nodes that handle payment-related queries in a Payment folder.\n* To group together a set of nodes that you want the dialog to process only if a certain condition is met. Use a condition, such as $isPlatinumMember, for example, to group together nodes that offer extra services that should only be processed if the current user is entitled to receive the extra services.\n* To hide nodes from the runtime while you work on them. You can add the nodes to a folder with a false condition to prevent them from being processed.\n\n\n\nThese characteristics of the folder impact how the nodes in a folder are processed:\n\n\n\n* Condition: If no condition is specified, then your assistant processes the nodes within the folder directly.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-tasks"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02953-12940-14393","score":0.7396028042,"text":"\nThe welcome and anything_else dialog nodes that are prepopulated in the tree do count toward the total.\n\nTree depth limit: The dialog supports 2,000 dialog node descendants; the dialog performs best with 20 or fewer.\n\nYou can see the number of dialog nodes in a dialog skill from the assistant tile.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/home\/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05998-4600-6427","score":0.7158287168,"text":"\nThe Kubernetes master configures the resources and deploys containers into pods on the worker nodes with available capacity.\n: Define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time. When you perform a rolling update, the deployment checks whether the update is working and stops the rollout when failures are detected.\n: A deployment is just one type of workload controller that you can use to manage pods. For help choosing among your options, see [What type of Kubernetes objects can I make for my app?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_deployobject). For more information about deployments, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/workloads\/controllers\/deployment\/).\n\nPod\n: Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. Usually, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/workloads\/pods\/).\n\nApp\n: An app might refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You might deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate worker nodes. For more information, see [Planning app deployments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy) and [Developing Kubernetes-native apps](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-app).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06079-7417-9399","score":0.7111076117,"text":"\n: The Kubernetes network proxy is a daemon that runs on every worker node and that forwards or load balances TCP and UDP network traffic for services that run in the cluster.\n\nkube-dashboard\n: The Kubernetes dashboard is a web-based GUI that allows users to manage and troubleshoot the cluster and applications that run in the cluster.\n\nheapster\n: Heapster is a cluster-wide aggregator of monitoring and event data. The Heapster pod discovers all nodes in the cluster and queries usage information from each node's kubelet. You can find utilization graphs in the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nIngress ALB\n: Ingress is a Kubernetes service that you can use to balance network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to multiple apps in your cluster. To expose your apps over the public or private network, you must create an Ingress resource to register your apps with the Ingress application load balancer (ALB). Multiple apps can then be accessed by using a single URL or IP address.\n\nStorage provider\n: Every cluster is set up with a plug-in to provision file storage. You can choose to install other add-ons, such as block storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n ibm-system namespace \n\nLogging and metrics\n: You can use the IBM\u00ae Log Analysis and IBM Cloud\u00ae Monitoring services to expand your collection and retention capabilities when working with logs and metrics.

For more information, see [Service architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n\nNamespace\n: Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams. For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like kube-system or ibm-system. If you don't designate a namespace when you create a Kubernetes resource, the resource is automatically created in the default namespace. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/overview\/working-with-objects\/namespaces\/).\n\nService\n: A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/services-networking\/service\/).\n\nDeployment\n: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations. You document a deployment in a configuration YAML file, and then apply it to the cluster. The Kubernetes master configures the resources and deploys containers into pods on the worker nodes with available capacity.\n: Define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time.

related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06480-1160-2754","score":0.7192420363,"text":"\n[IBM Developer<br><br>Visit IBM Developer for technical articles, code patterns, tutorials, and more.<br><br>![112-Developer-tools.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/112-Developer-tools.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/depmodels\/cloud\/)[Architecture Center<br><br>Discover the architecture references available for this product.<br><br>![190-Application-Platform.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/190-Application-Platform.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture)[IBM Training<br><br>Build your skills with IBM Cloud training.<br><br>![83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/83-Elements-of-the-cloud.svg)](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/training\/cloud)[Community<br><br>Join the IBM Cloud community and collaborate with others.<br><br>![35-Connectivity.svg](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/media\/docs\/images\/homepage\/35-Connectivity.svg)](https:\/\/community.ibm.com\/community\/user\/publiccloud\/home)\n\n Latest updates \n\n[View more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/acme-test?topic=acme-test-release-notes)12 December 2022 | Point-in-time Recovery\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB Enterprise Edition offers PITR using any timestamp greater than the earliest available recovery point.\n\n19 October 2022 | Deploying and Connecting an IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases Instance Tutorial\n\nThis tutorial guides you through the process of deploying a Cloud Databases instance and connecting it to a web front end by creating a webpage that allows visitors to input a word and its definition.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06501-7-1686","score":0.7148670554,"text":"\nGetting Started \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases for MongoDB allows developers to take advantage of the latest MongoDB features: rich JSON documents, powerful query language, multi-document transactions, and authentic APIs.

For example, if 3 documents are uploaded from the same folder and their placement in the folder is significant to their meaning, you might want to retain the parent folder information.\n\nWhen you upload a document, no such information about its relationships to other documents is stored by default. To add the information, you can use the API to add the documents. When you add documents by using the API, you can specify metadata values. You might want to specify a metadata value, such as \"foldername\": \"company_a\", for each document.\n\nAlternatively, you can copy the document body of each document into a JSON file, where each document is an object in a single array. When the JSON file is ingested, each item in the array is added as a separate document with a seprarate document ID. Each document shares the same parent ID, which identifies the relationship between them.\n\nYou can quickly find documents that share the same parent ID or other common metadata value from the Manage data page. Customize the view to show the field, such as extracted_metadata.parent_document_id or extracted_metadata.foldername, that the documents share in common.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I customize Discovery to understand my data \n\nYes. Use the intuitive tools provided with the product to teach Discovery about the unique terminology of your domain.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog. By default, all services with a Lite plan are displayed with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1\/icons\/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service.

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for compute resources \n\nYou're charged for the time that your apps run and the memory that's used in GB-hours. GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03411-4781-6488","score":0.6645882726,"text":"\nTo achieve the same goal, you can use a saved version as the basis for a new version in which you incorporate any changes you want to make.

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03043-1537-3553","score":0.6574313641,"text":"\nTo train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.\n* [Dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-build): A dialog is a branching conversation flow that defines how your application responds when it recognizes the defined intents and entities. You use the dialog editor in the tool to create conversations with users, providing responses based on the intents and entities that you recognize in their input.\n\n![Diagram of a basic implementation that uses intent and dialog only.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e\/assistant-data\/images\/basic-impl.png)\n\n\n\nTo enable your dialog skill to handle more nuanced questions, define entities and reference them from your dialog.\n\n\n\n* [Entities](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-entities); An entity represents a term or object that is relevant to your intents and that provides a specific context for an intent. For example, an entity might represent a city where the user wants to find a business location, or the amount of a bill payment. In the tool, the name of an entity is always prefixed with the @ character.\n\nYou can train the skill to recognize your entities by providing entity term values and synonyms, entity patterns, or by identifying the context in which an entity is typically used in a sentence. To fine tune your dialog, go back and add nodes that check for entity mentions in user input in addition to intents.\n\n\n\n![Diagram of a more complex implementation that uses intent, entity, and dialog.]","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02900-24807-26597","score":0.6562419534,"text":"\nFrom the Skills menu of the dialog skill where you want to enable disabmiguation, click Options.2.

Some of these views are designated as output views, while others are non-output views. Non-output views can include some views that are imported into or exported from a module. It is important to note that output views and exported views are orthogonal. For example, a view that is exported does not qualify as a view that is output. In addition to these views, the unique Document view represents the input document that is annotated by this extractor.\n\n\n\n Document view \n\nAt the AQL module level, Document view is a special view that represents the current document that is being annotated by that module. When two or more modules are combined to form an extractor, the duplicate-free union of Document schemas of all modules is the required Document view.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16471-106006-108222","score":0.6683729887,"text":"\nAll other spans are left untouched.\n* LeftToRight\n\nThis policy processes the spans in order from left to right.

Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy.\n* <priority_order>\n\nSpecifies either ascending or descending order. Can be specified only with the LeftToRight consolidation policy. The ascending order ensures that if a tuple T1 has priority 1 and a tuple T2 has priority 2, T1 has a higher priority than T2. By contrast, if the priority order is descending, T2 has a higher priority. The default value of the priority order is ascending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes \n\n\n\n* When the priority clause is present, the semantics of consolidation follow this order:\n\n\n\n* Process spans from left to right, and when spans overlap, retain the leftmost spans.\n* If you have multiple overlapping spans that start at the same offset, retain the ones with the highest priority according to the priority order.\n* Break remaining ties by retaining the longest spans among those spans with the same priority.\n\n\n\n* Consolidate treats nulls as identical. All inputs with a null <consolidate target> result in a single output tuple, which is chosen randomly among those inputs. This behavior is similar to how tuples are consolidated with an identical span in the target column. The exception to resulting in a single output tuple is if the policy is ContainsButNotEqual. In that case, the null <consolidate target> outputs all inputs with null consolidate target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Examples \n\nExample 1: Consolidate on single column\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the field Person.name of all output tuples and to use the ContainedWithin consolidation policy to resolve overlap.\n\nconsolidate on Person.name\nusing 'ContainedWithin'\n\nExample 2: Consolidate on expression, involving multiple columns\n\nThis example directs the system to examine the result of applying the CombineSpans scalar function to fields Person.firstname and Person.lastname in each output tuple.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03268-5869-7269","score":0.6558870077,"text":"\nYou might want to define the customization in the welcome node or another node that is triggered early in the conversation so it is applied any time disambiguation is triggered.\n\n{\n\"output\": {\n\"generic\": [\n]\n},\n\"context\": {\n\"smsAction\": {\n\"command\": \"smsActSetDisambiguationConfig\",\n\"parameters\": {\n\"prefixText\": \"%s.\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\n\nWhen displayed, the assistant shows the introductory text that is configured for disambiguation, such as Did you mean?.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time. They can change topics, follow a dialog flow about the unrelated topic to its end, and then return to where they were before.

For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03218-6464-8324","score":0.6650515199,"text":"\nYou can change the settings that are applied automatically to disambiguation from the Options page.To edit the disambiguation settings, complete the following steps:<-- <ol> -->1.

After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service.

Therefore, the version in cache is considered valid again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 2: For event-driven content, purge your cache \n\nFor example, every time a new post is added to your blog, you could easily purge the CIS cache. It is common to see event-driven content, and CIS makes it easy to guarantee that no stale content is reaching your users. The commands to purge the cache immediately across the entire global network are:\n\n\n\n* Purge all files\n* Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by hostnames (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by tags (Enterprise only)\n* Purge by URLs\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge all files \n\nYou have the option to force the entire cache to revalidate. You can reset all of the objects stored in the cache so that every request is routed to the origin server.\n\n\n\n\n\n Purge by prefixes (Enterprise only) \n\nEnterprise plan users can purge the cache by URL prefix or path separators in the URL. For example, valid purge requests for a URL such as https:\/\/www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg include:\n\n\n\n* www.example.com\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/\n* www.example.com\/foo\/bar\/baz\/qux.jpg\n\n\n\nPurging by prefix is useful when you want to purge everything within a directory, or increase control over cached objects in a particular path.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

However, information about the key (such as its metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an active state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a \"soft delete\" in that the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data it has encrypted. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.\n\nAs part of a testing and development process, it is normal to create and delete keys often. These keys are not gone forever; rather they are \"soft deleted\" and moved to a destroyed state. This does not mean they have been destroyed in the sense that they are gone forever. Instead, it simply means they cannot be used as part of any key actions such as using the key to encrypt or decrypt data. The key data can only be looked at, and, if the key was deleted in error, it might be possible to restore the key to an active state.\n\nThis intermediate period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Can restore? \n\n One-30 days Destroyed Yes Yes \n 30-90 days Destroyed Yes No \n After 90 days Purged* No No \n\n\n\nNote: because purged keys are completely inaccessible and \"destroyed\" in the common usage of the word, there is technically no \"purged\" key state. Purged keys are simply gone and therefore don't have a \"state\" one way or another.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-restore-keys"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_05045-6187-8076","score":0.750524044,"text":"\nIf a key is disabled, and then re-enabled quickly, requests made to that bucket may be rejected for up to an hour before cached key information is refreshed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Deleting keys and cryptographic erasure \n\nIt isn't possible to delete a root key associated with a bucket that has a [retention policy](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cloud-object-storage\/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutable) in place.

For more information, [see the Key Protect documentation](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-delete-purge-keysdelete-purge-keys-considerations).\n\nCryptographic erasure (or crypto-shredding) is a method of rendering encrypted data unreadable by [deleting the encryption keys](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-compliancedata-deletion) rather than the data itself. When a [root key is deleted in Key Protect](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/key-protect?topic=key-protect-delete-keys), it will affect all objects in any buckets created using that root key, effectively \"shredding\" the data and preventing any further reading or writing to the buckets.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match. A third party cannot use the hash without a copy of the original data.\n\nIt is important to be aware with this option that while Orgs A and B cannot see the actual ledger data because it is hashed, they are still able to see that Orgs C and D are transacting and can see the volume of transactions that are occurring between them.\n\nAlso, consider that data inside a private data collection can be purged from the peers that store it. While data is stored on a channel forever, collections allow members to specify how many blocks are committed to a channel before the [private data is purged](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.2\/private_data_tutorial.htmlpd-purge). Once data is removed from the private data collection, the hash on the channel can no longer be used to verify the transaction that created it.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there.

Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14639-1516-2901","score":0.7619762421,"text":"\nEnsure that you do not have any NSX objects that are expanded into the secondary instance that you want to delete.\n3.

All files are imported and exported as .txt files in BIND format. Learn more about [BIND format](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zone_file). Click the overflow menu and select to import or export records.\n\nImport records - By default, a total of 3500 DNS records are allowed (imported and created on CIS). You can import multiple files, one at a time, as long as the total number of records is under the max limit. After importing, you are shown a summary with the number of records successfully added and the number that failed, along with the reason why each record failed.\n\nExport records - Use Export records to create a backup of your zone file, or export it to use with another DNS provider. When this menu option is clicked, the records are downloaded to the location specified by your browser settings (typically the Downloads folder). To select another folder location, change your browser's settings to prompt you for a location with each download.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring and managing your secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally sign DNS data so you can be assured it is valid. To eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-set-up-your-dns-for-cis"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04149-3050-4970","score":0.7899522781,"text":"\nSelect Let's get started from the welcome page to begin setting up CIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

CIS does not store any customer data. Configuration data about your specific CIS configuration is encrypted in transit and at rest. CIS configuration data is deleted on your request through the UI, CLI, or API.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Protecting your sensitive data in CIS \n\nAll data related to CIS configuration is not considered sensitive data.

Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there.

The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-faq"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08438-4499-6203","score":0.7310069203,"text":"\nAfter you set the crypto units to imprint mode, you can choose to delete your service instance through the IBM Cloud console resources page, the instance details page, or the CLI.\n\n\n\n Deleting instances from the IBM Cloud console resources page \n\nYou can delete an instance of Hyper Protect Crypto Services from the IBM Cloud console resources page by completing the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

This choice is best for fields with unique or specialized terminology because this pre-annotator does not analyze the context in which the term is used in the way a machine learning pre-annotator does; it instead relies on the term being distinct enough to have a decipherable meaning regardless of the context in which it is used. For example, it is easier to recognize asbestos as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of squash, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.\n\nDictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-preannotation"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16507-3099-4772","score":0.7612171769,"text":"\nIt can incorporate some of the function of the dictionary pre-annotator if you enable it, by identifying class types for dictionary terms that it finds in the documents also.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can upload already-annotated documents, and use them to start training the machine learning model.

A pre-annotator is a Knowledge Studio dictionary, rule-based model, or machine learning model that you can run to find and annotate mentions automatically.\n\nPre-annotation makes the job of human annotators easier because it covers the straightforward annotations, and gets the job of annotating the documents underway.\n\nThe method that you use to pre-annotate documents in no way restricts the ways that you can use the resulting model. For example, just because you use the Natural Language Understanding service to pre-annotate documents does not mean you must deploy the final machine learning model that you build to the Natural Language Understanding service.\n\n\n\n Pre-annotation methods \n\nThe following pre-annotators are available:\n\n\n\n* Dictionary\n\nUses a dictionary of terms that you provide and associate with an entity type to find mentions of that entity type in the documents. This choice is best for fields with unique or specialized terminology because this pre-annotator does not analyze the context in which the term is used in the way a machine learning pre-annotator does; it instead relies on the term being distinct enough to have a decipherable meaning regardless of the context in which it is used. For example, it is easier to recognize asbestos as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of squash, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.\n\nDictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes. Human annotators can specify entity subtypes for each pre-annotated mention by working on an [annotation task](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask) with the pre-annotated document.\n* Machine learning\n\nUses a machine learning model to automatically annotate documents.

Two types of metrics are calculated from the CDN's usage: those that show the metrics over a time period as a graph, and those that are shown as aggregate values.\n\nFor metrics that display the change over a period of time as a graph, you can see three line graphs and a pie chart. The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/). Both categories can display metrics for 7-, 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-day periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Object storage origin support \n\nIBM Cloud CDN can be configured to serve content from an object storage endpoint by providing the endpoint, the bucket name, protocol, and port. Optionally, you can specify a list of file extensions to allow caching for files only with those extensions. All objects in the bucket must be set with anonymous read or public read access.\n\nFor more information, see [Accelerate delivery of static files using a CDN](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-static-files-cdn).\n\n\n\n\n\n Path-based CDN mappings","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09920-7689-8996","score":0.6538122296,"text":"\nCorrelate documents from different sources \n\nCorrelate content across documents by using the Python NLTK and IBM Data Science Experience.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/patterns\/watson-document-correlation\/)\n* [Get the Code ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/watson-document-co-relation?cm_sp=Developer-_-watson-document-correlation-_-Get-the-Code)\n* [View the Demo ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/youtu.be\/vDCaBPhAr64?cm_sp=Developer-_-watson-document-correlation-_-View-the-Demo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Discover hidden Facebook usage insights \n\nHarness the power of cognitive data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook with PixieDust.\n\n\n\n* [Learn more ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/patterns\/discover-hidden-facebook-usage-insights\/)\n* [Get the Code ![External link icon](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/icons\/launch-glyph.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/IBM\/pixiedust-facebook-analysis?cm_sp=IBMCode-_-discover-hidden-facebook-usage-insights-_-Get-the-Code)\n* [View the Demo !","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-sample-apps"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13406-6795-8870","score":0.6495501399,"text":"\nThe metrics indicate the progress and complexity of the engine's processing:\n\n\n\n* seen_by_engine is audio that the service has read and passed to the engine at least once.\n* received - seen_by_engine is audio that has been buffered at the service but has not yet been seen or processed by the engine.\n* The relationship between the times is received >= seen_by_engine >= transcription >= speaker_labels.\n\n\n\nThe following relationships can also be helpful in understanding the results:\n\n\n\n* The values of the received and seen_by_engine fields are greater than the values of the transcription and speaker_labels fields during speech recognition processing.

The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response.

The dialog has always supported the user's ability to change subjects. If none of the nodes in the dialog branch that is being processed match the goal of the user's latest input, the conversation goes back out to the tree to check the root node conditions for an appropriate match. The digression settings that are available per node give you the ability to tailor this behavior even more.With digression settings, you can allow the conversation to return to the dialog flow that was interrupted when the digression occurred. For example, the user might be ordering a new phone, but switches topics to ask about tablets. Your dialog can answer the question about tablets, and then bring the user back to where they left off in the process of ordering a phone. Allowing digressions to occur and return gives your users more control over the flow of the conversation at run time.

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports\/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-cm-7"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16030-3224-5225","score":0.6842523813,"text":"\nSix different types of virtual server instance data packet flows occur in a VPC.

Each packet is tagged with the proper VNI (virtualized network identifier) to maintain data isolation. The flows are then sent to the destination hypervisor that hosts the destination virtual server instance. The destination hypervisor strips off the VNI and forwards the data packet to the destination virtual server instance.\n\nInter-subnet, intra-zone data flows - These flows involve packets that use the VPC's implicit router function, which connects all subnets that are created in the VPC. It routes the data packet to the correct destination hypervisor. If the destination hypervisor is different from the source hypervisor, the data packet is tagged with the proper VNI and sent to the destination hypervisor.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_13875-2836-4661","score":0.6679276824,"text":"\n* [Virtual Network Functions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha) in combination with a Network Load Balancers to support a high availability and scalability.\n* Virtual private endpoint gateways.\n* DNS resolution.\n\n\n\nA layered architecture will introduce resources and demonstrate connectivity.

With IBM Cloud VPC, you can provision VNF devices to gain better and more affordable scalability than you would by purchasing physical network devices.\n\nTraffic destined for servers in IBM Cloud VPC must be delivered to healthy VNF devices; otherwise, traffic disruption occurs. You can use network load balancers with routing mode to perform health checks and to ensure that workloads only travel through healthy VNF devices. Because of this, network load balancers with routing mode support only VNF devices as back-end targets.\n\nFor detailed examples of various ways you can deploy your NLB with routing mode, refer to [HA VNF deployments](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf-ha&interface=ui).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites for NLB with routing mode \n\nTo support routing mode, you must first create a service-to-service authentication policy for your NLB.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16387-7-1890","score":0.7008894086,"text":"\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public\/private key pair.

Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"><\/div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02855-1612-3501","score":0.6325901747,"text":"\nSets the color of interactive elements, including:\n\n\n\n* Chat launcher button that is embedded in your web page\n* Send button associated with the input text field\n* Input text field border when in focus\n* Marker that shows the start of the assistant\u2019s response\n* Border of a button after it is clicked\n* Border of the drop-down list field as the user chooses an option\n* Typing indicator that is shown to repesent a pause response\n\n\n\n* Assistant image: This image is displayed in the web chat header along with the assistant name to represent your assistant or organization.

Create a RS256 private\/public key pair.\n\nYou can use a tool such as the OpenSSL command line or PuTTYgen.\n\n\n\n* For example, to create the key pair: openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\n\n\n\n2. Use your private key to sign a JSON Web Token (JWT). You will pass the token with the messages that are sent from your website as proof of their origin.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify values for the following claims:\n\n\n\n* iss: Represents the issuer of the JWT. This value is a case-sensitive string.\n* sub: Represents the principal that is the subject of the JWT. This value must either be scoped to be locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique. The value you specify for sub is used as the user_id.\n\nThe user ID that is specified in the sub claim is also sent in the customer_id section of the X-Watson-Metadata HTTP header. The customer_id can be used to make requests to delete user data. Because the ID is sent in a header field, the syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7230section-3.2) (all visible ASCII characters). For more information about deleting user data, see [Labeling and deleting data](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-information-securityinformation-security-gdpr-wa).\n* exp: Represents the expiration time on or after which the JWT cannot be accepted for processing.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":0.6844683886,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

Choose the tone and language of your assistant \n\nBefore you build your assistant, it can also be helpful to choose the tone with which your assistant communicates. Is your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Write conversations that reflect your assistant's personality. Don't overdo it by sacrificing usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. Strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe that the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chatbots to identify themselves as chatbots.\n\nDecide whether and how you want to handle more than one spoken language.

Watson Assistant prepares the data for Analytics in the background.\n\nAfter the numbers in metrics hit the 3,000 and above range, the totals are approximated to prevent performance lags in the page.\n\n\n\n Scorecards \n\nThe scorecards give you a quick view of your metrics. Scroll to see full interactive graphs later in the page.\n\n![Shows the scorecards that are displayed at the start of the Analytics page](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/scorecard.png)\n\n\n\n* Total conversations: The total number of conversations between active users and your assistant that occur during the selected time period. The total conversations metric and the User conversations page only include conversations in which both the assistant and customer participate. Conversations that only have welcome messages from the assistant, or that only have user messages of zero length, are not included. This metric is not used for billing purposes. An exchange with a user is not considered a billable conversation until the customer submits a message.\n* Avg. msg. per conversation: The total messages received during the selected time period divided by the total conversations during the selected time period, as shown in the corresponding graph.\n* Max. conversations: The maximum number of conversations for a single data point within the selected time period.\n* Weak understanding: The number of individual messages with weak understanding.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-logs-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03354-4-1897","score":0.6954821348,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

You can use this history to improve how your assistants understand and respond to user requests.\n\nTo open a list of individual messages between customers and the assistant that uses this dialog skill, select User conversations in the navigation bar.\n\nWhen you open the User conversations page, the default view lists inputs that were submitted to the assistant for the last day, with the newest results first. The top intent (#intent) and any recognized entity (@entity) values used in a message, and the message text are available. For intents that are not recognized, the value shown is Irrelevant. If an entity is not recognized, or has not been provided, the value shown is No entities found.\n\n![Logs default page](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/logs_page1.png)\n\nThe User conversations page displays the total number of messages between customers and your assistant. A message is a single utterance that a user sends to the assistant. A conversation typically consists of multiple messages.

It uses a dictionary lookup approach to match a word from the user input to an existing entity value or synonym in the skill's training data. For example, if the user enters boook, and your training data contains a @reading_material entity with a book value, then fuzzy matching recognizes that the two terms (boook and book) mean the same thing.\n\nIn dialog, when you enable both autocorrection and fuzzy matching, the fuzzy matching function runs before autocorrection is triggered. If it finds a term that it can match to an existing dictionary entity value or synonym, it adds the term to the list of words that belong to the skill, and does not correct it.\n\nFor example, if a user enters a sentence like I wnt to buy a boook, fuzzy matching recognizes that the term boook means the same thing as your entity value book, and adds it to the protected words list. Your assistant corrects the input to be, I want to buy a boook. Notice that it corrects wnt but does not correct the spelling of boook. If you see this type of result when you are testing your dialog, you might think your assistant is misbehaving. However, your assistant is not. Thanks to fuzzy matching, it correctly identifies boook as a @reading_material entity mention. And thanks to autocorrection revising the term to want, your assistant is able to map the input to your buy_something intent.

If you only want to connect to a client application or messaging channel over the private network, then you must build your own custom client application or channel integration.\n* Before you can use a search integration or search skill, you must create a Discovery instance with a private network endpoint. The list of Discovery instances that are displayed for you to connect to includes only instances with private network endpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related topics \n\n\n\n* [Security architecture](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/architecture\/architecture\/practices\/watson-security-architecture\/): Describes the security components that are needed for secure cloud development, deployment, and operations.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-securing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03071-1627-3396","score":0.6708330512,"text":"\nIt has no example user utterances associated with it yet.\n3.

By defining entities, you can help your assistant identify references in the user input that are related to intents of interest. In this step, you will enable system entities that can recognize references to time, date, and numbers.\n\n\n\n1. Click Entities to open the Entities page.\n2. Enable system entities that can recognize date, time, and number references in user input. Click the System entities tab, and then turn on these entities:\n\n\n\n* @sys-time\n* @sys-date\n* @sys-number\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have successfully enabled the @sys-date, @sys-time, and @sys-number system entities. Now you can use them in your dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 3: Add a dialog node with slots \n\nA dialog node represents the start of a thread of dialog between your assistant and the user. It contains a condition that must be met for the node to be processed by your assistant. At a minimum, it also contains a response.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial-slots"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-86555-88392","score":0.6698186398,"text":"\nFrench language beta support added for contextual entities\n: You can add contextual entities to French-language dialog skills.

The following change was made with this version:\n\n\n\n* An integrations property was added to the V2 \/message context. The service now expects the context.integrations property to conform to a specific schema in which the allowed values are as follows:\n\n\n\n* chat\n* facebook\n* intercom\n* liveengage\n* salesforce\n* slack\n* service_desk\n* text_messaging\n* voice_telephony\n* zendesk\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your app uses a context.integrations property that does not conform to the schema, a 400 error code will be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n 31 March 2020 \n\nThe web chat integration was updated\n: The update adds an isTrackingEnabled parameter. You can add this parameter and set it to false to add the X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out header to each \/message request that originates from the web chat. For more information about the header, see [Data collection](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/assistant\/assistant-v2data-collection).
