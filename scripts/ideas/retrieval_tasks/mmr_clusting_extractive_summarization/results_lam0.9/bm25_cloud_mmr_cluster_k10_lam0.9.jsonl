The service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events. If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number.

Following are the three key concepts in RAID:\n\n\n\n* Mirroring: copying data to more than one disk\n* Striping: splitting data across more than one disk\n* Error correction (fault tolerance): redundant data is stored to allow problems to be detected and possibly fixed.\n\n\n\nAlthough many different levels of RAID exist, IBM chooses to support the most common RAID types: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10. The different RAID levels use one or more of the following techniques, depending on the system requirements. The main purpose of using RAID is to improve reliability by using either 3Ware 9550SX Raid SATA or an Adaptec SA-SCSI RAID controller for all RAID solutions deployed.\n\nRAID is not a backup solution. Rather, RAID creates a single usable data disk, where several physical disks are combined into an array for better speed and fault tolerance.\n\nRAID 0 (Striped set without parity / Non-Redundant Array) Implements data striping, where file blocks are written across multiple disks in fragments that require a minimum of two disks. The advantage of a RAID 0 is that the read/write speed is dramatically increased. The more disks that are in the array, the greater the bandwidth. The disadvantage to a RAID 0 is that it has no fault tolerance. If a single drive fails, the array is broken. Also, RAID 0 does not implement error checking. So, any error is also unrecoverable. A common solution for fault tolerance is to have a drive outside of the array that is used as backup storage in a hardware failure.\n\nRAID 1 (Mirrored set without parity) Implements data mirroring. Data is duplicated on 2 or 4 disks through a hardware raid controller and provides some fault tolerance. The array is recoverable if at least one drive does not fail. It provides faster read performance than a single drive and provides drive redundancy if a drive failure occurs. Write speed is slightly reduced.\n\nRAID 5 (Striped set with dual distributed parity) Implements data striping at a block level and distributes parity among the disks.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05138-7979-9034", "score": 21.25385124092189, "text": "\nAfter your bucket is created with Activity Tracker and Monitoring, it may take a few minutes for the rules to take effect.\n\nYou are now ready to store data in a secure content store with encryption, monitoring, and audit observability!\n\n\n\n\n\n Get started by uploading data \n\n\n\n* See [uploading data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Add capabilities \n\nAdd capabilities to protect objects from ransomware and accidental deletion such as [versioning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning) and [immutable retention polices](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-ol-overview) for supporting immutable storage, and immutable backup and archive data.\n\n\n\n\n\n Library of Object Storage tutorials \n\nCheck out the IBM Cloud Tutorials library for more tutorials when deploying solutions with [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=tutorials&page=1&pageSize=20&tags=cloud-object-storage).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-secure-content-store"}]}

A private load balancer is a load balancer only accessible from within the VPC network and/or where the client has reachability to the VPC network (for example, through Direct Link or Transit Gateway).\n\nFor private load balancers, you must have a dedicated subnet with no custom routes configured for the subnet.\n\nNetwork load balancers with route_mode set to true are private load balancers that support only VNF (virtual network function) devices as back-end targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Load-balancing methods \n\nThree load-balancing methods are available for distributing traffic across back-end application servers: round-robin, weighted round-robin, and least connections.\n\n\n\n Round-robin \n\nRound-robin is the default load-balancing method. With this method, the load balancer forwards incoming client connections in a round-robin fashion to the back-end servers. As a result, all back-end servers receive roughly an equal number of client connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n Weighted round-robin \n\nWith this method, the load balancer forwards incoming client connections to the back-end servers in proportion to the weight assigned to these servers. Each server is assigned a default weight of 50, which can be customized to any value in the range 0 - 100.\n\nFor example, if application servers A, B, and C have the weights 60, 60, and 30, then servers A and B receive an equal number of connections, while server C receives half that number of connections.\n\nSetting a server weight to 0 means that no new connections are forwarded to that server, but any existing traffic continues to flow. Using a weight of 0 can help bring down a server gracefully and remove it from service rotation.\n\nThe server weight values are applicable only with the weighted round-robin method. They are ignored with the round-robin and least connections load-balancing methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Least connections \n\nWith this method, the back-end server instance that serves the least number of connections at a given time receives the next client connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Use case 1: High traffic volume", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-network-load-balancers"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-26901-28959", "score": 10.308916275902874, "text": "\nIf we want to fetch a single document back from the database, then documents sit one level beneath the database in the hierarchy of the URL.\n\nSo acurl $URL/books/id means \"get document ID from the database books from the IBM Cloudant service at the supplied URL\".\n\nNotice the hierarchy: service, database, and document.\n\nSo far we only used the GET HTTP method, which is the default one for curl and the one used when you enter a URL into your web browser.\n\nIBM Cloudant's API often uses the HTTP method as a verb to describe the action that is asked of the database: GET for fetching data.\n\nWith curl, we can specify the method that we want to use with the -X command-line option.\n\nSo to write a new document to our books database that uses the API, we're going to use the POST method, massing a document as the body of the HTTP request.\n\nacurl -X POST specifies we're using the POST HTTP method. -d specifies the document that we want to write, which is sent as the body of the request, and finally, the URL we are writing to which is $URL/books - the books database.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the PUT method, if we are supplying the ID of the document that is being written.

No passages are chosen from the remaining 70 documents.\n\n\n\nIf your goal is to get the best 10 short answers, a good approach is to give the answer-finding feature various passages from more documents than just the top 10.

When find_answers and per_document are both set to true, the document search results and the passage search results within each document are reordered by using the answer confidences. The goal of this reordering is to place the best answer as the first answer of the first passage of the first document. Similarly, if the find_answers parameter is set to true and per_document parameter is set to false, then the passage search results are reordered in decreasing order of the highest confidence answer for each document and passage.\n* Both v1 and v2 support custom stop words. However, there are a few differences in how custom stop words are used:\n\n\n\n* There is no default custom stop words list for Japanese collections in v2.\n* When you define custom stop words in v1, your stop words list replaces the existing stop words list. In v2, your list augments the default list. You cannot replace the list, which means you cannot remove stop words that are part of the default list in v2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Update how your application handles query results \n\nThe way that your application shows query results might need to be updated due to the following differences between the query results document syntax between the v1 and v2 queries:\n\n\n\n* At the entity enrichment level, the following information is not supported in v2:\n\n\n\n* Disambiguation\n* Emotion\n* Sentiment\n\n\n\nThe Part of Speech enrichment is applied automatically to documents in most project types in v2, but the index fields that are generated by the enrichment are not displayed in the JSON representation of the document.\n\nZoom\n\n![Difference in entities data structure](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/discovery-data/images/compare-result-syntax.png)\n\nFigure 1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-migrate-to-v2"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07086-6808-9095", "score": 23.93345943883915, "text": "\nFor relevancy training to be used, you must successfully train the project either programmatically ([Create training query method](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery-datacreatetrainingquery)) or by using the product user interface.\n\nQPP\n: A Query Performance Prediction algorithm that, given a query and a list of top results, produces a score that determines how relevant a document is.

Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.\n\nYou can check your usage by going to Manage > Billing and usage in the IBM Cloud console, and selecting Usage.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service.

These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}]}

The IBM Cloud platform interacts with service brokers to create and manage service instances and service bindings. Service bindings are the representation of an association between an application and a service instance, which often include the credentials that the application uses to communicate with the service instance. Providing valid metadata values creates a successful REST API response when a request is performed.\n\nIBM Cloud uses the Open Service Broker API (OSB) version 2.12 specification. Read through and familiarize yourself with the [Open Broker API spec](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.12/spec.md), and use the readme file as a guide to learn more.\n\nWhen the resource controller receives a request to create a resource, it calls your OSB to validate the service type, product, plans, and regions availability. The resource controller also validates the visibility of the plan that is associated with the customer account. IBM Cloud provides broker samples and API docs that extend the OSB spec. You can find more details about developing and hosting your broker as you walk through the detailed integrated billing onboarding development steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud metering service \n\nIf a service offers a metered plan, IBM Cloud users are charged based on the amount of resources that they use.

Any existing subscriptions from accounts that are imported into the enterprise are moved to the enterprise account and added to the enterprise [credit pool](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprisecredit-pool).\n\n\n\n1. Go back to the Enterprise dashboard by clicking Dashboard. In the Billing section, you can view available credit, remaining credit, and subscription expiration dates.\n2. To view details about all subscriptions in the enterprise, click View subscriptions.\n\nIn the Platform subscription section, you can view the subscription start date, end date, starting credit and available credit. To add more credit, you can purchase additional subscriptions and apply the subscription code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 6: Invite users to manage your enterprise \n\nIn a large organization like Example Corp., there are likely other people who you want to give access to manage the enterprise so they can do their jobs. In this case, you want to give department leads of the Marketing, Development, and Sales account groups access to manage their accounts and resource usage, and you want the Example Corp. financial officer to have access to view the entire enterprise's billing and usage. To give other users access, you invite them to the enterprise account and assign them the appropriate access.\n\nFirst, invite the department leads and assign them access.\n\n\n\n1.

Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place. This unified view of your credit spending means you can right-size your subscriptions across all of your usage to make sure you're getting the best deal. And there's no juggling multiple invoices - your enterprise billing administrator gets a single invoice with the details of any charges.

The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response.

Instead of adding those topics as counterexamples which can be hard to find later, capture the customer input examples as new intents. But don't link dialog nodes to the intents until you're ready. If customers ask about one of these topics in the meantime, the anything_else node is triggered to explain that the assistant can't help with the current request, but can help them with other things.\n\n\n\n Irrelevance detection \n\nThe irrelevance detection feature helps your dialog skill recognize subjects that you do not want it to address, even if you haven't explicitly taught it about what to ignore.

This feature also validates the SQL query. The output results can be visualized in different formats, which can be rendered into a graph or a flow chart. Data exchange happens between single or multiple nodes within a fragment. Each fragment has a set of data that is distributed between the nodes.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can run the query and show the output in a distributed environment. You can output the results in different formats. When queries are run, they scan through the database. The queries retrieve table metadata to fetch the correct output.\n\nWith this visual explain feature, you can visualize the query in a graphical representation. When a query is run in the SQL editor and selects the Explain option, watsonx.data uses an EXPLAIN SQL statement on the query to create a corresponding graph. This graph can be used to analyze, fix, and improve the efficiency of your queries by saving time and cost.\n\nTo view the execution plans for a query that is run in watsonx.data SQL editor, follow the steps:\n\n\n\n1.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

To query data on Object Storage without a table in the catalog, you need to specify the data location (the corresponding Object Storage URI) and the data format in your SELECT statement. During query execution, data and schema are dynamically discovered as part of the SQL compilation process. This process, called inference, derives column names, data types, the list of partitions, and individual objects on Object Storage that together make up the table data.\n\nInferring all this information and doing it repetitively with every query imposes latency to your queries. The inference process can take up a significant amount of time, especially for text formats (for example, CSV and JSON), or when thousands of objects exist in different table partitions. In some cases, the inference process even accounts for the largest part of the overall query execution time. So, if you are either familiar with the schema, or want to repetitively use the data for queries, create a table in the catalog.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore.

Data skipping indexes apply to structured data sets in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage and store summary metadata for each object in the data set. The indexes are stored in Cloud Object Storage in a user-provided bucket, similarly to the data. SQL queries benefit from an index by skipping over all objects whose metadata indicates that they are not relevant to the indicated query.\n\n\n\n Benefits \n\n\n\n* Boosts performance of your queries\n* Reduces cost of your queries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Overview \n\nFor each of the columns in an object, summary metadata can include minimum and maximum values, a list or bloom filter of the appearing values, or other metadata that represents the data in that column. The summary metadata is then used during query evaluation to skip over objects that do not contain any relevant data. All formats are supported, including Parquet, ORC, CSV, and JSON. Data skipping is used for performance optimization. Data skipping does not affect the content of query results. IBM Cloud\u00ae Data Engine currently supports metaindexes only. Metaindexes are indexes on a higher level, thus they index objects instead of rows.\n\nAs Data Engine charges on a per-query basis based on the amount of data scanned, reducing the number of bytes scanned per query, reduces cost while it improves performance. For data skipping to work well and for good performance overall, use the [best practices for data layout](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout), such as using the Parquet format and adopting Hive-style partitioning. Ideally, create tables by using the [Cloud Object Storage catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-hivemetastore). Data skipping complements these best practices and provides significant cost savings and performance benefits.\n\nTo use this feature, you must create indexes on one or more columns of the data set. Start by indexing columns that you query most often in the WHERE clause. A full stop (\".\") in any column name is not supported.\n\nThe following four index types are supported:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-index_management"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-67367-68536", "score": 22.53106259252388, "text": "\n* [fullselect](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencefullselect)\n* [functionOrAggregate](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencefunctionOrAggregate)\n* [groupByClause](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencegroupByClause)\n* [groupingSet](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencegroupingSet)\n* [lateralView](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencelateralView)\n* [predicate](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencepredicate)\n* [primaryExpression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceprimaryExpression)\n* [resultColumn](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceresultColumn)\n* [sample](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencesample)\n* [sortItem](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencesortItem)\n* [tableValuedFunction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencetableValuedFunction)\n* [valuesClause](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencevaluesClause)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-13973-15274", "score": 22.480578362688973, "text": "\nFor more information about clauses that are used in a query, see the following topics:\n\n\n\n* [COSURI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceCOSURI)\n* [CRN_URI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceCRN_URI)\n* [DB2_TABLE_URI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceDB2_TABLE_URI)\n* [fullselect](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencefullselect)\n* [identifier](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceidentifier)\n* [namedQuery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencenamedQuery)\n* [query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencequery)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Related references - query \n\nA query is referenced by the following clauses:\n\n\n\n* [booleanExpression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencebooleanExpression)\n* [namedQuery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencenamedQuery)\n* [predicate](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencepredicate)\n* [primaryExpression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceprimaryExpression)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fullselect clause \n\n\n\n\n\n fullselect \n\nA fullselect is the core component of a query.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-76137-77641", "score": 22.310169182408274, "text": "\n* [columnReference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecolumnReference)\n* [expression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceexpression)\n* [functionOrAggregate](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencefunctionOrAggregate)\n* [identifier](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceidentifier)\n* [number](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencenumber)\n* [query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencequery)\n* [STRING](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceSTRING)\n* [valueExpression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencevalueExpression)\n* [timeSeriesExpression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencetimeSeriesExpression)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Predicates \n\n\n\n predicate \n\nThe BETWEEN ...

By providing custom identifiers, you can control the column names that are used in the result data set written to Cloud Object Storage.

Both the dialog and the client application can read and write context variables.\n\nYou can choose whether you want the context to be maintained by your application or by the Watson Assistant service:\n\n\n\n* If you use the stateful v2 message API, the context is automatically maintained by the assistant on a per-session basis. Your application must explicitly create a session at the beginning of each conversation. The context is stored by the service as part of the session and is not returned in message responses unless you request it. For more information, see the [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2message).\n* If you use the stateless v2 message API (or the legacy v1 message API) your application is responsible for storing the context after each conversation turn and sending it back to the service with the next message. For a complex application, or an application that needs to store personally identifiable information, you might choose to store the context in a database.\n\nA session ID is automatically generated at the beginning of the conversation, but no session data is stored by the service. With the stateless message API, the context is always included with each message response. For more information, see the [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2messagestateless).\n\n\n\nImportant: One use of the context is to specify a unique user ID for each user who interacts with the assistant.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-4-2366", "score": 35.74146097124232, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing image security with Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor is provided as part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}]}

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01533-3131-4993", "score": 22.674945115244288, "text": "\n* Applies exemption policies to reports at an account, [namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_namespace), [repository](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_repository), or [tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_tag) level to mark when issues that are flagged do not apply to your use case.\n\n\n\nThe following functions are available in version 4:\n\n\n\n* Scans images for issues.\n* Provides an evaluation report that is based on security practices that are specific to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n* Provides instructions about how to fix a reported [vulnerable package](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-va_indexpackages) in its reports.\n* Applies exemption policies to reports at an account, [namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_namespace), [repository](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_repository), or [tag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overviewoverview_elements_tag) level to mark when issues that are flagged do not apply to your use case.\n\n\n\nThe Security status column in the Images tab of the Container Registry dashboard displays the number of issues that are associated with each image.

Annotate the entity types, relation types, and coreference the entities as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Guideline Notations \n\n\n\n* Square brackets [ ] indicate the extent to be annotated when less than the entire quoted text is annotated.\n\nInclude negations as appropriate, for example [no injuries]ACCIDENT_OUTCOME. The type system is not using entity class to represent negation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Entity Types \n\nThe type system does not use entity sub-types or roles, nor mention types or classes.\n\n\n\n Entity types Guidelines Examples \n\n ACCIDENT_OUTCOME A consequence of an accident. Applies to both humans (e.g., death) and cars (e.g., dented). Can include \"towed\" and \"air bag deployment\" as indicators of severity of damage, and \"transported to hospital\" (but not funeral home) as indicators of severity of injury. Can include negation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotate-documents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16468-14825-17168", "score": 19.329846506357306, "text": "\nTo connect the ground truth editor and adjudication tool to your annotation guidelines:\n\n\n\n1.

The system connects the ground truth editor and adjudication tool to your annotation guidelines. Depending on the access permissions granted to users when you created the guidelines, human annotators and workspace administrators might be able to update the guidelines after opening them, for example, to add clarifications and examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotation guidelines \n\nThere is no prescribed format for how to document the guidelines, but it is important that the guidelines include detailed examples. Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced. Changes that you make in one area must be evaluated and coordinated with changes that you make in another area.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotate-documents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16417-3559-5683", "score": 18.51206057752644, "text": "\nTo help you identify areas that require investigation, scores that fall below the value that you specified for the inter-annotator agreement threshold are highlighted in red.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08259-0-511", "score": 19.040177573996324, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift for HPC \n\nUse these release notes to learn about the latest updates to Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae for HPC that are grouped by date.\n\n\n\n  March 2022 \n\n\n\n  24 March 2022 \n\nIntroducing Red Hat OpenShift for HPC solutions\n:   You can now take advantage of automated deployment of a Red Hat OpenShift cluster along with a deployer virtual server instance, which allows you to easily assemble, compile, and deploy your HPC applications to the Red Hat OpenShift cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hpc-openshift?topic=hpc-openshift-release-notes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10283-0-1125", "score": 18.022933716683863, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Why can't I use the Red Hat annotations to restrict access to the Red Hat OpenShift Console? \n\nVirtual Private Cloud\n\nClassic infrastructure\n\n  What\u2019s happening \n\nWhen you use the Red Hat ip_whitelist allowlist annotation to allow only certain source IP addresses to access the Red Hat OpenShift Console, it does not work as expected.\n\n  Why it\u2019s happening \n\nBy default, the source IP address is not preserved from the client (console web browser) through the load balancer and to the router pod.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller takes into consideration the priority of a pod and can even preempt (remove) pods with lower priority to make room on a worker node for higher priority pods. For more information, see the [Red Hat OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html).\n\nWhy do I set pod priority?\n: As a cluster administrator, you want to control which pods are more critical to your cluster workload.

The Red Hat OpenShift controller can even preempt (remove) lower priority pods that are running so that pending higher priority pods can be scheduled.\n\nBy setting pod priority, you can help prevent lower priority workloads from impacting critical workloads in your cluster, especially in cases where the cluster starts to reach its resource capacity.\n\nMake sure that you have [set up proper user access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-usersusers) to your cluster, and if applicable, [security context constraints (SCCs)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_sccoc_sccs).

As such, app deployments that run in community Kubernetes clusters might need to be modified to run in Red Hat OpenShift.\n\n\n\n Customizing security context constraints \n\nTo create, edit, list, delete, and otherwise manage security context constraints, see the [Red Hat OpenShift docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html). You can also authorize users or groups to the default security context constraints by using role-based access control such as clusterroles, clusterrolebindings, roles, and rolebindings.

The oc version is the same as that of the cluster being managed.\n\nGuidelines for assigning access to SCCs:\n\n\n\n* Authorize specific service accounts to the SCC that is to be used by pods running under that service account.\n* If a service account needs access to multiple SCCs, consider creating additional service accounts so that all pods running under a service account are expected to use the same SCC.\n* Do not authorize all users or all service accounts to use any SCC other than the restricted (4.10 and earlier) or restricted-v2 (4.11 and later) SCCs.\n* Do not change SCC authorization for service accounts in the openshift- namespaces.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces.

If the callback URL was already successfully allowlisted, the service sends status code 200 in response to the initial POST request.\n\n\n\n Security considerations \n\nWhen you successfully use the POST /v1/register_callback method to register a callback URL, the service allowlists the URL to indicate that it is verified for use with callback notifications.

Specifying a user secret provides authentication and data integrity for requests that use the callback URL with the asynchronous HTTP interface.\n\nThe service uses the user secret to compute an HMAC-SHA1 signature over the payload of every callback notification that it sends to the URL. The service sends the signature via the X-Callback-Signature header with each notification. The client can use the secret to compute its own signature of each notification payload. If its signature matches the value of the X-Callback-Signature header, the client knows that the notification was sent by the service and that its contents have not been altered during transmission.

'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace.

In general, they depend on running multiple instances of the application and managing how the various instances are updated. You can pre-configure the following common deployment strategies in Continuous Delivery:\n\nBasic\n: Deploys the new release by stopping and updating all of the running instances simultaneously, causing downtime. For rollback, you must deploy the previous version again, which causes extra downtime. Although this strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements, it is the riskiest and causes downtime. The Basic deployment strategy is not recommended for critical apps that must be highly available.\n\nRolling update\n: Similar to the Basic strategy, this deployment strategy is simple, fast, and has low runtime resource requirements. However, because each running instance is taken down and updated individually, avoiding downtime, rollback requires you to deploy the previous release again. This time consuming approach might cause issues if the current version of the app in production is broken.\n\nBlue-Green deployment\n: Creates two separate, permanent production environments (blue and green), and only one of those environments receives traffic at a time. The current release is always deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched to it after deployment completes, with no downtime. Because you need to switch only the traffic to the unchanged environment, rollback does not cause downtime. Because this strategy requires two full production environments, the resource requirements are higher. However, this strategy enables powerful Developer flows, such as the ability to test new app versions in the production environment before it allows customer traffic. Blue-Green deployment also supports fast rollback.\n\nCanary release\n: Deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment (similar to Blue-Green), with no downtime. The amount of traffic that is sent to both the updated and original instances is managed so that the new version is available to a controlled subset of users while the deployment proceeds.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes"}]}

There should be no obvious error messages in the logs and the resources are reported in the logs as created. Manually verify these resources exist in the namespace and then delete the Job. This will cause the install to continue.\n* Some documents may show two html fields when applying an enrichment.

For the created objects in Object Storage, the question arises if this operation is transaction safe and ACID compliant? In other words, if you create an object in Object Storage by using Data Engine, can you assume that this creation is transaction safe? If anything happens before the creation is done, it is rolled back?\n\nThe answer is IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage does not support transactions. However, an object is rolled back if you create it with a single SQL query job on a nonpartitioned object on Object Storage because Object Storage itself does object write in an atomic fashion. If you want to write complex hierarchies of objects with a single SQL job, two scenarios can happen: 1) the job fails half way through and only part of the objects are written, or 2) during job execution some objects are already visible while others are still in process to be written. For the latter scenario, use Hive-style partitioned tables, which means that the SQL job writes a new set of objects into a new Object Storage prefix location. This method does not affect anything in the Hive-style partitioned table. Only when you then also issue an ALTER TABLE \u2026 ADD PARTITION with the newly written object location, the data is made available in the Hive-style partitioned table. That ALTER TABLE DDL is in fact also an atomic operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n How to handle large time series data sets? \n\nWhen you use time-series queries, in general, the more time series that exist, the better the parallelism.\n\nThe following example query creates one time series per key, and partitions the data based on the key. Anytime a query is run against \"ts\", it is run in parallel across time series.\n\nselect\nkey,\nts\nfrom table\nusing time_series_format(key=\"key\", timetick=\"time_tick\", value=\"amount\") in ts\n\nThe issue arises if \"ts\" is large and thus does not fit in the memory of one machine. To mitigate this issue, modify your key as follows.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-faq"}]}

For the complete list of parameters, see the [Query reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-referenceparameter-descriptions).\n\nSearch parameters\n\nSearch parameters enable you to search your collection, identify a result set, and perform analysis on the result set.\n\nThe results set is the group of documents identified by the combined searches of the search parameters. The results set might be significantly larger than the returned results. If an empty query is performed, the results set is equal to all the documents in the collection.\n\n\n\n query \n\nA query search returns all documents in your data set with full enrichments and full text in order of relevance. A query also excludes any documents that don't mention the query content. These queries are written using the [Discovery Query Language](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-operators).\n\n\n\n\n\n filter \n\nA cacheable query that excludes any documents that don't mention the query content. Filter search results are not returned in order of relevance. These queries are written using the [Discovery Query Language](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-operators).\n\n\n\n Differences between the filter and query parameters \n\nIf you test the same search term on a small data set, you might find that the filter and query parameters return very similar (if not identical) results. However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07178-6197-7974", "score": 14.587107471263938, "text": "\n[Example query structure](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ded4adc3ea0bd2a81b113c579f2b1183926da211/discovery/images/query_structure2.png)\n\nOperators that evaluate a field (<= , >=, <, >) require a number or date as the value.

See [Understanding the difference between Entities, Concepts, and Keywords](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-configserviceudbeck).\n\n\n\nAfter you click Run query and open the JSON tab, query highlighting is turned on, by default. The setting adds a highlight field to your query results. Within the highlight field, the words that match your query are wrapped in HTML <em> (emphasis) tags. For more information, see the [Query parameters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parametershighlight).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Building combined queries \n\nYou can combine query parameters together to build more targeted queries.

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more.

To differentiate between engine and network stalls, results are periodic rather than event-based.\n\n\n\nThe metrics can also help you estimate response jitter by examining the periodic arrival times. Metrics are generated at a constant interval, so any difference in arrival times is caused by jitter.\n\n\n\n Requesting processing metrics \n\nTo request processing metrics, use the following optional parameters:\n\n\n\n* processing_metrics is a boolean that indicates whether the service is to return processing metrics. Specify true to request the metrics. By default, the service returns no metrics.\n* processing_metrics_interval is a float that specifies the interval in seconds of real wall-clock time at which the service is to return metrics. By default, the service returns metrics once per second. The service ignores this parameter unless the processing_metrics parameter is set to true.\n\nThe parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds. The level of precision is not restricted, so you can specify values such as 0.25 and 0.125. The service does not impose a maximum value.\n\n\n\nHow you provide the parameters and how the service returns processing metrics differ by interface:\n\n\n\n* With the WebSocket interface, you specify the parameters with the JSON start message for a speech recognition request. The service calculates and returns metrics in real-time at the requested interval.\n* With the asynchronous HTTP interface, you specify query parameters with a speech recognition request. The service calculates the metrics at the requested interval, but it returns all metrics for the audio with the final transcription results.\n\n\n\nThe service also returns processing metrics for transcription events. If you request interim results with the WebSocket interface, you can receive metrics with greater frequency than the requested interval.\n\nTo receive processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic intervals, set the processing interval to a large number.

When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07067-26099-28206", "score": 13.305914496840167, "text": "\nIf false, ranks the passages from all of the documents by passage quality regardless of the document quality and returns them in a separate passages field in the response.\n* When passages are returned for a query, you can also enable answer finding. When true, answer objects are returned as part of each passage in the query results. When find_answers and per_document are both set to true, the document search results and the passage search results within each document are reordered by using the answer confidences. The goal of this reordering is to place the best answer as the first answer of the first passage of the first document. Similarly, if the find_answers parameter is set to true and per_document parameter is set to false, then the passage search results are reordered in decreasing order of the highest confidence answer for each document and passage.\n* Both v1 and v2 support custom stop words. However, there are a few differences in how custom stop words are used:\n\n\n\n* There is no default custom stop words list for Japanese collections in v2.\n* When you define custom stop words in v1, your stop words list replaces the existing stop words list.

For more information, see [Advantages of the WebSocket interface](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-featuresfeatures-websocket-advantages). For more information about the WebSocket interface and its parameters, see the [API & SDK reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n Managing a WebSocket connection \n\nThe WebSocket recognition request and response cycle has the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. [Open a connection](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-websocketsws-open)\n2. [Initiate a recognition request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-websocketsws-start)\n3.

The return code can also indicate that the input text was too large.\n\n\n\nIf the socket closes with an error, the service sends the client an informative message of the form {\"error\": \"Specific error message\"} before closing. The service can also send non-fatal warning messages for unknown parameters. For more information about WebSocket return codes, see the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [Request for Comments (RFC) 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).\n\nThe WebSocket implementations of the SDKs can return different or additional response codes.\n\n\n\n Example error and warning messages \n\nThe following examples show error responses. They include a JSON text message and a formatted message from the client's onClose() callback method. The formatted messages begin with the boolean true because the connection is closed. They also include the WebSocket error code that caused the closure.\n\n\n\n* This example shows error messages for an invalid argument for the accept parameter:\n\n{\n\"error\": \"Unsupported mimetype.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-usingWebSocket"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10833-0-1231", "score": 16.440628006422482, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  WebSocket \n\nThe preinstalled /whisk.system/websocket package for IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions offers a convenient way to post messages to a WebSocket.\n\nThe package includes the following actions.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For any language, the pronunciation also depends on the length and context of the string, as well its composition in terms of the positions and grouping of its characters\n\n\n\n* Alphabetic strings are pronounced as words if they are pronounceable in the language of the voice. Otherwise, the characters are spelled out individually. Whether a string is pronounced or spelled out can also depend on the case of the letters.\n* Numeric strings can be pronounced as cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, dates, or in other ways, including as individual digits.\n* Alphanumeric strings that contain both letters and numbers can be pronounced in different ways depending on the characteristics of the string. For example, they might be pronounced as combinations of words, cardinal numbers, or digits. But as mentioned previously, the pronunciation depends largely on the string and its composition.\n\n\n\nThe best means of controlling how a specific string is pronounced is to use the <say-as> element of the SSML. The element allows you to specify exactly how a string is synthesized. You use the interpret-as attribute of the <say-as> element to indicate that a string of characters is to be pronounced as letters, digits, or in some other way. The available values differ by language.\n\nIf you use the letters or digits attributes, all letters and numbers of the string are pronounced individually.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-synthesis-params"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16242-7-2224", "score": 28.080499210114446, "text": "\nResponse modes \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nYou can choose a response mode for each action to set how it behaves. The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16242-1610-3614", "score": 27.35057576320519, "text": "\nFor example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

Or, if you prefer, you can connect the assistant to your existing infrastructure by configuring an existing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk.\n\nA SIP trunk is equivalent to an analog telephone line, except it uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to transmit voice data and can support multiple concurrent calls. The trunk can connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or your company's on-premises private branch exchange (PBX). If you choose to generate a free phone number for your assistant, a SIP trunk is automatically provisioned from IntelePeer. You can also choose to use an existing SIP trunk from a provider such as IntelePeer, Genesys, or Twilio.\n\nGenerating a free phone number is available only with new phone integrations. If you have an existing phone integration and you want to switch to a free phone number, you must delete the existing integration and create a new one.\n\nWhen your customer makes a phone call using the telephone number connected to your assistant, the phone integration answers. The integration converts output from your assistant into voice audio by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service. The audio is sent to the telephone network through the SIP trunk. When the customer replies, the voice input is converted into text by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service.\n\nThis feature is available only to Plus or Enterprise plan users.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-phone"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03158-2940-4987", "score": 19.96159851093908, "text": "\nIn the Integrations section on the main page for your assistant, click Add integration.\n2.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service.

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 27.56998170710024, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 24.03308739625832, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04170-1738-2974", "score": 22.866861271023176, "text": "\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced. Changes that you make in one area must be evaluated and coordinated with changes that you make in another area.

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced. Changes that you make in one area must be evaluated and coordinated with changes that you make in another area. For example, if you add an entity type, review the guidelines for annotating relation types and specify how the new entity type can relate to other entity types.\n\n\n\n\n\n Annotation guidelines example \n\nMost annotation guidelines will need a lot of detail and examples to ensure that human annotators consistently annotate text.\n\nThe example presented here is a simple guideline that was created for a small domain that contains traffic incident reports.\n\n\n\n Task Goals \n\n\n\n* As project members, become familiar with the iterative process of manual annotation and machine learning model refinement.\n* Annotate documents in the automotive domain with the ground truth editor and use the annotations to train a machine learning model.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16507-1455-3632", "score": 29.768752111776966, "text": "\nThis choice is best for fields with unique or specialized terminology because this pre-annotator does not analyze the context in which the term is used in the way a machine learning pre-annotator does; it instead relies on the term being distinct enough to have a decipherable meaning regardless of the context in which it is used.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 22.3383281176868, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03164-1607-3518", "score": 20.476204911340133, "text": "\nFor more information about it, read the [Slack blog post](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/more-precision-less-restrictions-a3550006f9c3) about it.\n8.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

This happens when the integration or client application starts the session with an empty message and then waits for the assistant to greet the user, as in the following situations:\n\n\n\n* Preview for the assistant\n* \"Try it out\" pane\n* Web chat integration with home screen disabled\n\n\n\nHowever, the Welcome node is skipped in situations when the user initiates the conversation by sending a message, such as with the Slack and Facebook integrations. It is also skipped when using the Web chat integration with the home screen enabled, because in this situation the home screen provides the greeting. (Note that the home screen is enabled by default.)\n\nUnlike the welcome special condition, the conversation_start special condition is always triggered at the start of a conversation. You can use a combination of nodes with these two special conditions (welcome and conversation_start) to manage the start of your dialog in a consistent way.\n\nFor more information, see [Special conditions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-special-conditions).\n\n\n\n Setting initial context \n\nIf you need to set initial context variables at the beginning of each conversation, make sure you do so in a way that works with all of the integrations you plan to use. Do not use the Welcome node to set initial context variables unless you are certain your dialog will only be accessed in situations where the welcome special condition is triggered.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-start"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16261-12076-14011", "score": 22.121453797042264, "text": "\nBecause we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.\n\nIn addition to maintaining our place in the conversation, the context can also contain action variables that store any other data you want to pass back and forth between your application and the assistant. This can include persistent data you want to maintain throughout the conversation (such as a customer's name or account number), or any other data you want to track (such as the contents of a shopping cart or user preferences).\n\n\n\n* Python\n* Node\n\n\n\n Example 3: Preserves context to maintain state.\n\nfrom ibm_watson import AssistantV2\nfrom ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator\n\n Create Assistant service object.\nauthenticator = IAMAuthenticator('{apikey}') replace with API key\nassistant = AssistantV2(\nversion = '2021-11-27',\nauthenticator = authenticator\n)\nassistant.set_service_url('{url}') replace with service instance URL\nassistant_id = '{environment_id}' replace with environment ID\n\n Initialize with empty message to start the conversation.\nmessage_input = {\n'message_type:': 'text',\n'text': ''\n}\ncontext = {}\n\n Initialize with empty message to start the conversation.\nmessage_input = {\n'message_type:': 'text',\n'text': ''\n}\ncontext = {}\n\n Main input/output loop\nwhile message_input['text'] != 'quit':\n\n Send message to assistant.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03233-10023-12075", "score": 21.391067429755005, "text": "\nFor more information about the methods available for you to use, see [Expression language methods](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methods).\n\n\n\n\n\n Deleting a context variable \n\nTo delete a context variable, set the variable to null.\n\n\n\nNulling a context variable\n\n Variable Value \n\n order_form null \n\n\n\nAlternatively you can delete the context variable in your application logic.

By calling an extension from an action, your assistant can send requests to the external service and receive response data it can use in the conversation.\n\nFor example, you might use an extension to interact with a ticketing or customer relationship management (CRM) system, or to retrieve real-time data such as mortgage rates or weather conditions. Response data from the extension is then available as action variables, which your assistant can use in the conversation.\n\nFor information about how to build a custom extension, see [Build a custom extension](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-build-custom-extension).\n\n\n\n Calling the extension from a step \n\nTo call a custom extension from an action:\n\n\n\n1.

Optional: In the Assistant says field, type a message to be shown to the customer before the extension is called (for example, Please wait while I retrieve your account balance...).\n\nThe output from this step is sent to the channel with the global context variable skip_user_input set to true. This variable tells the channel to display the message but not to prompt the customer for a reply. Instead, the channel sends an empty message, enabling the assistant to proceed with the call to the extension.\n\nAll built-in channel integrations (such as the web chat) respect the skip_user_input context variable.

If the customer wants bring-your-own-key (BYOK) encryption, then the customer is required to use Key Protect to store the customer-managed encryption key. The customer must select an appropriate key management service instance, and select a disk encryption key option during provisioning of an IBM Cloudant Dedicated Hardware plan instance. \n Make data unreadable to IBM Cloudant Operators None, IBM does not render data unreadable to IBM Cloudant Operators. If you intend to store sensitive information in an IBM Cloudant database, you must use client-side encryption to render data unreadable to IBM Cloudant operators. For example, for PCI DSS compliance, you must encrypt the Primary Account Number (PAN) before sending a document that contains it to the database. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery \n\nDisaster recovery includes the following tasks:\n\n\n\n* Provide dependencies on disaster recovery sites.\n* Provision disaster recovery environments.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-responsibilities"}]}

Please rephrase your question.\n>> I want to make an appointment.\nWhat day would you like to come in?\n>> Thursday\nI'm afraid I don't understand.

And if you tell it you want to make an appointment, the correct action is triggered; but once again, it doesn't understand when you answer the follow-up question.\n\nThis is happening because we are using the stateless message method, which means that it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain state information for the conversation. Because we are not yet doing anything to maintain state, the assistant sees every round of user input as the first turn of a new conversation. Because it has no memory of asking a question, it tries to interpret your answer as a new question or request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Maintaining state \n\nState information for your conversation is maintained using the context. The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16471-192768-195041", "score": 10.300513867691429, "text": "\n* deterministic/not deterministic\n\nThe optional deterministic/not deterministic specifies whether the function is stateless. A deterministic function always returns the same value for the same set of input values.\n* return null on null input\n\nThe optional return null on null input specifies the function behavior when one or more of the input values are null. If return null on null input is specified, the system returns null on null input without invoking the UDF. If called on null input is specified, the UDF is invoked even for null input values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage notes for UDFs implemented in PMML \n\nFunctions that are created from PMML files take a single table that is called params as their argument and output a table. The implementation of the function maps input fields between the input and output schema declared in the create function statement and the schema that is specified in the PMML file. In other words, the DataDictionary section that describes the names and types of fields that can appear in the input and output records that the model produces and consumes, the MiningSchema section that tells which named files defined in the DataDictionary section are in each tuple that represents a feature vector ,and the Output section that tells which named fields defined in the DataDictionary section are present in each tuple of the external representation of the output of the model. These functions must be table functions; each row in the table is passed to the PMML model and produce an output row.\n\nThis schema information is necessary because the PMML and AQL type systems do not match perfectly. For example, PMML has several types to represent timestamps, while AQL currently requires users to encode timestamps as string values. The schema information also allows developers who know AQL but not PMML to understand the AQL rule set.\n\nThe AQL compiler checks the input schema against the input schema of the PMML file to ensure that the two schemas are compatible. If the two schemas contain fields with the same name but incompatible types, compilation fails with an appropriate error message. If the function\u2019s input or output schemas contain extra or missing columns, the resulting function ignores these columns and does not generate an error.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-annotation-query-language-reference"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00432-7609-8368", "score": 10.174642015335076, "text": "\nEdit topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nFocus sentinel\n\n Give us your feedback \n\nTell us about your experience0/1500\n\n\n\nDon't include any sensitive or personal information.\n\nHow satisfied are you with your experience?\n\nHow satisfied are you with your experience?\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\ninfo icon\n\nYour feedback is carefully reviewed, but you won't be contacted in response.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key.

Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers.

If you associated an identity without administrative privilege on the ordering service node, you will not be able to view or manage ordering service details.\n\n Why it\u2019s happening \n\nThis problem can be caused by a [bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1006243) introduced by the Chrome browser Version 77.0.3865.90 (Official Build) (64-bit) that causes actions from the browser to fail.\n\n How to fix it \n\nTo resolve this problem, open the console in a new browser tab in Chrome. Any identities that you saved in your console wallet will persist in the new browser tab. To avoid this problem you can upgrade your Chrome browser version.

If the node is a CA and the status has been gray for more than a few minutes, then it is likely that the deployment process has failed. Peers and ordering nodes take longer to deploy, but this condition can also occur when the health checker that runs against the peer or ordering nodes cannot contact the node.

Many cloud customers find the Level-3 VPN approach more palatable than ACLs to their auditors and compliance officers.\n* IBM Cloud customers can extend or migrate the reach of their network significantly, due to addition of new sites or applications throughout the IBM network.\n* Tenant-specific routing tables narrow the aperture for IP address overlap, without the risk of overlap with other tenants' subnets or other parts of the network that are not applicable.\n\n\n\nCompared to the older ACL model, there are a few minor tradeoffs to take into account:\n\n\n\n* Converting to a customer VRF requires a maintenance window, which causes a brief disruption of backbone traffic flows.\n* Remote access by using the managed VPN services (SSL, IPsec) is limited to just SSL VPN into a data center; however, the shared ACL over the backbone allows global access from any entry point from either service.\n* VLAN spanning is a feature of the shared tenancy model and is not available in a VRF; this will be disabled upon conversion to the Customer VRF.\n* IPsec VPN managed service on IBM Cloud classic infrastructure remote access is not available.\n\n\n\nMany IBM Cloud customers currently operate with a shared tenancy model on the IBM Cloud network.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

You can use the /dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the /dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog. You can make a backup copy of the current dialog by exporting the conversational skill in which it resides.

However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values.

The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type.

An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}]}

Purchase a plan with higher artifact limits.\n2. Create a service instance in the new plan.\n3. Upload the skill to the new service instance.\n4.

You successfully created an assistant that can answer questions about Discovery by retrieving information from the product documentation by way of the NeuralSeek service.\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nIn this tutorial, you created a Watson Discovery Document Retrieval project with uploaded PDF files that contain the Discovery product documentation. Separately, you created a Watson Assistant virtual assistant with a single action that can recognize user questions about Discovery. You added a custom extension to your assistant that connects to a third-party service called NeuralSeek that gets the correct answer from Discovery and rewords the response.

Next, you can publish your assistant to a production environment and deploy it. You can deploy the assistant in various ways.

However, because the user's input includes the word tomorrow and the reservation node with slots is being processed, your assistant assumes the user is providing or updating the reservation date instead. The current node always gets priority. If you define a clear confirmation statement, such as, Ok, setting the reservation date to tomorrow, the user is more likely to realize there was a miscommunication and correct it.\n\nConversely, while filling slots, if the user provides a value that is not expected by any of the slots, there is a chance it will match against a completely unrelated root node that the user never intended to digress to.\n\nBe sure to do lots of testing as you configure the digression behavior.\n* When to use digressions instead of slot handlers: For general questions that users might ask at any time, use a root node that allows digressions into it, processes the input, and then goes back to the flow that was in progress. For nodes with slots, try to anticipate the types of related questions users might want to ask while filling in the slots, and address them by adding handlers to the node.\n\nFor example, if the node with slots collects the information required to fill out an insurance claim, then you might want to add handlers that address common questions about insurance. However, for questions about how to get help, or your stores locations, or the history of your company, use a root level node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Disambiguation \n\nWhen you enable disambiguation, you instruct your assistant to ask users for help when it finds that more than one dialog node can respond to their input. Instead of guessing which node to process, your assistant shares a list of the best node options with the user, and asks the user to pick the correct one.\n\n![Shows a sample conversation between a user and the assistant, where the assistant asks for clarification from the user.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/disambig-demo.png)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-runtime"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03185-6701-8694", "score": 28.539187520587152, "text": "\n[A sample dialog tree with example content](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/dialog-depiction-full.png)\n\nThe dialog tree in this diagram contains two root dialog nodes. A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-55745-57714", "score": 28.52577508099005, "text": "\nIf your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.\n\n![Screen capture of the field in the node edit view where you add the node purpose summary.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/disambig-node-purpose.png)\n\nEvery dialog branch can be processed by the assistant while it chats with a customer, including branches with root nodes in folders.\n4. If a child node in any dialog branch conditions on a request or question that you do not want the assistant to handle, add a Connect to human agent response type to the child node.\n\nAt run time, if the conversation reaches this child node, the dialog is passed to a human agent at that point.\n\n\n\nYour dialog is now ready to support transfers from your assistant to a service desk agent.\n\nFor more information about different service desk solutions, see the following resources:\n\n\n\n* [Adding service desk support to the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-haa)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03113-6206-7586", "score": 18.3185271944047, "text": "\n[Example dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/dialog_api_1.png)\n\nWe can create a new node by making a POST request to /dialog_nodes with the following body:\n\n{\n\"dialog_node\": \"node_8\"\n}\n\nThe dialog now looks like this:\n\n![Example dialog 2](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/dialog_api_2.png)\n\nBecause node_8 was created without specifying a value for parent or previous_sibling, it is now the first node in the dialog.

After defining the intent, you can add a root-level dialog node that conditions on the intent. As the dialog node response, add a Connect to human agent response type. At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person.

Containment is the rate at which your assistant is able to satisfy a customer's request without human intervention per conversation.\n\nTo measure containment accurately, the metric must be able to identify when a human intervention occurs. The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type. If you use an alternate method to deliver additional support, you must take additional steps to register the fact that the customer's need was not fulfilled by the assistant.

Click Add response to add another response type to the current response.\n\nYou might want to add multiple response types to a single response to provide a richer answer to a user query. For example, if a user asks for store locations, you could show a map and display a button for each store location that the user can click to get address details. To build that type of response, you can use a combination of image, options, and text response types. Another example is using a text response type before a pause response type so you can warn users before pausing the dialog.\n\nYou cannot add more than 5 response types to a single response. Meaning, if you define three conditional responses for a dialog node, each conditional response can have no more than 5 response types added to it.\n\nA single dialog node cannot have more than one Connect to human agent or more than one Search skill response.\n3.

Use this approach to address multiple scenarios in a single node.\n\nThe node still has a main condition, which is the condition for using the node and processing the conditions and responses that it contains.\n\nIn this example, your assistant uses information that it collected earlier about the user's location to tailor its response, and provide information about the store nearest the user.

By using this API, you can develop a user-facing client that can be deployed for production use, an application that brokers communication between an assistant and another service (such as a chat service or back-end system), or a testing application.\n\nBy using the v2 runtime API to communicate with your assistant, your application can take advantage of the following features:\n\n\n\n* Automatic state management. The v2 runtime API manages each session with an end user, storing and maintaining all of the context data your assistant needs for a complete conversation.\n* Ease of deployment using assistants. In addition to supporting custom clients, an assistant can be easily deployed to popular messaging channels such as Slack and Facebook Messenger.\n* Versioning. With dialog skill versioning, you can save a snapshot of your skill and link your assistant to that specific version. You can then continue to update your development version without affecting the production assistant.\n* Search capabilities. The v2 runtime API can be used to receive responses from both dialog skills and search skills. When a query is submitted that your dialog skill cannot answer, the assistant can use a search skill to find the best answer from the configured data sources. (Search skills are a beta feature available only to Plus or Premium plan users.)\n\n\n\nFor details about the v2 API, see the Watson Assistant [v2 API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v2).\n\nNote: The Watson Assistant v1 API still supports the legacy /message method that sends user input directly to the workspace used by a dialog skill.

When specified in combination with PARTITIONED INTO, the same is done, which is often referred to as clustering the rows by the specified columns into the fixed number of partitions specified by PARTITIONED INTO. When specified without the PARTITIONED clause, it is equivalent to an ORDER BY clause specified at the top level of the SQL SELECT statement. If PARTITIONED INTO is specified, the ORDER BY clause is ignored.\n\n\n\n Partition by columns \n\nWhen you use the PARTITIONED BY (column-list) clause without specifying INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS, you can store the query result by using Hive-style partitioning, which is to create partitions that contain only rows that have certain values for one or more columns. Choose this physical layout if the stored object is further analyzed by using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.\n\nFor example, a result object that contains worldwide order data has a column country to represent the country that the order is initiated from. Partitioning the result object by the column PARTITIONED BY (country), would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.\n\nWhen the result object is stored this way on Cloud Object Storage, each SQL query that contains a predicate, such as country = 'USA' or country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY'), benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during SQL query execution partitions must be read only if they contain data for the countries of interest. This layout tremendously cuts down the I/O traffic of the SQL query.\n\nSee the following extra remarks on Hive-style partitioning.\n\n\n\n* Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme because the column names that are used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, /order/COUNTRY=USA/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet.\n* Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are stored in the object prefix of the partition.

This statement removes the table definition from the catalog without affecting the actual data on Object Storage:\n\nDROP TABLE customers\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned tables \n\nYou can manage a table in the catalog that references data that is organized in multiple partitions on Object Storage.

The column must be a column name that is included in the schema definition of the CREATE TABLE statement.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET /db/id) or a range of _ids (GET /db/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing.

The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings. For more information, see [Global settings for actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-actions-global-settings).\n\nYou can choose what mode to use when you create a new action. Clarifying mode is the default and is designed for use with new, untested actions that need training.\n\nThe settings are:\n\nClarify when one action matches: If an assistant prioritizes one action that it thinks matches the customer's request, it can clarify the match by asking the customer to confirm. This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification. Instead of guessing which action to use, your assistant shows a list of the possible actions to the customer and asks the customer to pick the right one.\n\nOffer support option when asking a clarifying question: The assistant can include a choice to connect to other support.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-action-response-modes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16242-1610-3614", "score": 22.914953156945415, "text": "\nFor example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

It's important to distinguish how each action is triggered. When a user enters a question or request, the phrase is evaluated across all the Customer starts with examples in every action. If two actions have similar phrase examples, then the wrong action might get triggered by your user's question.\n\n\n\n Confidence scoring \n\nBehind the scenes, Watson Assistant determines a confidence score for each phrase. The score is absolute, meaning that a confidence score is assigned based on a predetermined scale, and not relative to other customer phrases.

For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

The unexpected line breaks can impact the efficiency of enrichments, such as custom rule recognition.\n\nCause: As part of their ingestion into Discovery, such files are converted from Office format to PDF format. When the conversion happens, textual content is sometimes lost due to the nature of a PDF file. While the new lines appear to be added at random, they typically get inserted in areas where text wraps in the original document, such as in narrow text boxes or to accommodate other inline elements, such as images or diagrams.\n\nSolution: To avoid new line insertions, increase the width of text boxes in the original document. If the original document has a section where text wraps to accommodate an inline element, such as an image, move the image so that it is situated in its own section and the nearby text doesn't need to wrap around it. To test whether your fixes address the issue, you can convert the original file to a PDF file to check for unexpected carriage returns in the text.\n\nAfter applying a pretrained Smart Document Understanding model to a PPT file, table boundaries are not recognized properly\n: During the conversion process, text that is extracted from the table is confused with text that is outside the table in some PPT pages. This issue is more likely to occur in tables with a lot of text and that have footnotes displayed just outside the table border. If you encounter this issue, export the PPT file as a PDF file, and then upload the PDF file instead. Apply a user-trained Smart Document Understanding (SDU) model to the document, and then use the SDU tool to identify the tables in the document.

The initial volume and network bandwidth allocation depends on the [instance profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles) and the bandwidth ratio that you selected for your instance.\n\nThe allocation of the instance's total bandwidth can be adjusted, balancing between network bandwidth and volume bandwidth. If you do not specify the initial volume and network bandwidth allocation, then 25% of total instance bandwidth is allocated to volume bandwidth and 75% is allocated to network bandwidth.\n\nThe maximum volume bandwidth is the highest potential bandwidth that can be allocated to the volume when it is attached to an instance. In cases where the total maximum bandwidth of attached volumes exceeds the amount that is available on the instance, the bandwidth for each volume attachment is set proportionally. The bandwidth is allocated based on the corresponding volume's maximum bandwidth.\n\nThe volume bandwidth available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes.\n\nFor more information, see [Bandwidth allocation for instance profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bandwidth-allocation-profiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n How block size affects performance \n\nIOPS value is based on a 16 KB block size (for all the tiers) with a 50-50 read/write random workload. Each 16 KB of data read/written counts as one read/write operation; a single write of less than 16 KB counts as a single write operation.\n\nBaseline throughput is determined by the number of IOPS multiplied by the throughput multiplier. The throughput multiplier is 16 KB for 3 IOPS/GB or 5 IOPS/GB tiers, or 256 KB for 10 IOPS/GB or custom IOPS tiers. The higher the IOPS that you specify, the higher the throughput. Maximum throughput is 1024 MBps.\n\nThe application I/O size directly impacts storage performance. If the application I/O size is smaller than the throughput multiplier that is used by the profile to calculate the volume\u2019s bandwidth limit, the IOPS limit is reached before the throughput limit.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-capacity-performance&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01234-7-2066", "score": 18.09259117957987, "text": "\nGetting started with File Storage for Classic \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae File Storage for Classic is persistent, fast, and flexible network-attached, NFS-based File Storage for Classic. In this network-attached storage (NAS) environment, you have total control over your file shares function and performance. File Storage for Classic shares can be connected to up to 64 authorized devices over routed TCP/IP connections for resiliency.\n\nFor more information about using File Storage for Classic with the IBM Cloud\u00ae Kubernetes Service, see [Storing data on classic IBM Cloud File Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nFile Storage for Classic volumes can be provisioned from 20 GB to 12 TB with two options:\n\n\n\n* Provision Endurance tiers that feature pre-defined performance levels and other features like snapshots and replication.\n* Build a high-powered Performance environment with allocated input/output operations per second (IOPS).\n\n\n\nFor more information about the File Storage for Classic offering, see [What is IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/products/file-storage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Provisioning considerations \n\n\n\n Block size \n\nThe IOPS value for both Endurance and Performance is based on a 16-KB block size with a 50/50 read and write, 50/50 random and sequential workload. A 16-KB block is the equivalent of one write to the volume.\n\nThe block size that is used by your application directly impacts the storage performance. If the block size that is used by your application is smaller than 16 KB, the IOPS limit is realized before the throughput limit. Conversely, if the block size that is used by your application is larger than 16 KB, the throughput limit is realized before to the IOPS limit.\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows examples of how block size and IOPS affect the throughput.

The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nThe actions skill is available as a beta feature. For more information, see [Adding an actions skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-actions-add).\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance. For more information, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\nText messaging integration was renamed\n: The Twilio messaging integration was renamed to SMS with Twilio.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9 October 2020 \n\nSearch skill update", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02998-1325-2715", "score": 40.0552478252944, "text": "\nName the assistant My first assistant.\n3.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Adding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03027-4976-6968", "score": 24.04242843512782, "text": "\nEnglish (en) GA Deprecated \n Arabic (ar) GA Deprecated \n Chinese (Simplified) (zh-cn) GA Deprecated \n Chinese (Traditional) (zh-tw) GA Deprecated \n Czech (cs) GA Deprecated \n Dutch (nl) GA Deprecated \n French (fr) GA Deprecated \n German (de) GA Deprecated \n Italian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English. All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing a skill language \n\nOnce a skill has been created, its language cannot be modified. If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-language-support"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03027-7-1946", "score": 24.0279182231382, "text": "\nSupported languages \n\nWatson Assistant supports individual features to varying degrees per language.\n\nWatson Assistant has classifier models that are designed specifically to support conversational skills in the following languages:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

You can verify if a cluster does or does not use a system channel by clicking the cluster's tile and looking near the Orderer Type text.\n\nJoining an orderer to an application channel will make it either a follower or a consenter. It will be a consenter if the node is found in the the channel's config block in the consenters section. Otherwise the orderer will be a follower. Both types of orderers will receive transaction/block data, but only a consenter can vote and play a role in the consensus algorithm. A node can be promoted from a follower to a consenter by first joining it to the channel, and then editing the channel's config to add it as a consenter. Similarly these steps can be reversed to demote an orderer and unjoin it completely if need be.\n\nJoining an orderer to the application channel can be started by clicking the cluster's tile.

If it is, you will not be able to delete the node until it has been removed as a consenter from all channels. After removing the node as a consenter from all channels, you will be able to delete the node by clicking the trash can icon.

It provides a single, standardized method for failover detection at any protocol layer over any media. BFD also provides a way for network administrators to detect forwarding-path failures at a uniform rate, rather than the variable rates of different routing protocol hello mechanisms. Network profiling and planning is easier, and reconvergence time is predictable, consistent, and significantly faster.\n\nBFD support comes pre-enabled with your direct link. However, BFD doesn\u2019t start working until you activate the feature during direct link creation, or on an existing direct link. No prerequisites are required. Simply configure this feature with the following values:\n\n\n\n*  Interval \u2013 The interval is the minimum time (in milliseconds) expected to occur between when the local routing device sends BFD hello packets and the reply from its neighbor. This value can range from 300 to 255,000 milliseconds.\n*  Multiplier \u2013 The multiplier is the number of times that a hello packet is missed before BFD declares the neighbor down. This value can range from 1 to 255. The default multiplier value is 3.\n\n\n\nWhen using BFD, avoid using graceful restart on the Direct Link BGP session. Graceful restart helper is configured on the Direct Link router. If the customer side of the BGP session is configured with graceful restart, then the routes that the IBM router receives remain in the routing table for 300 seconds, even if BFD is triggered.\n\n\n\n  Related link \n\n[Activating and deactivating Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-activate-deactivate-bfd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-bfd"}]}

To use dual authorization, be sure to identify a user who can set the key for deletion and another who can delete the key. Users with a Writer or Manager role can set keys for deletion, but only users with a Manager role can delete keys.\n* Plan to delete the key within a seven day authorization period. When the first user authorizes a key for deletion, it remains in the [Active state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-states) for seven days, during which all key operations are allowed on the key. To complete the deletion, another user with a Manager role can use the Key Protect GUI or API to delete the key at any point during those seven days, at which time the key will be moved to the Destroyed state.

Unless a custom domain is specified, IBM Cloud uses a default shared domain in the route to your app. You can create and use a custom domain by using either the IBM Cloud console or the command-line interface.\n\nThe default shared domain is mybluemix.net, but appdomain.cloud is another domain option that you can use. For more information about migrating to appdomain.cloud, see [Updating your domain](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-update-domain).\n\nTo use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain on a public DNS server, and then configure the custom domain in IBM Cloud. Next, you must map the custom domain to the IBM Cloud system domain on the public DNS server. After your custom domain is mapped to the system domain, requests for your custom domain are routed to your app in IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\n Adding a custom domain from the IBM Cloud console \n\nComplete these steps to add a custom domain for your org by using the console:\n\n\n\n1.

The internet has a large suite of protocols to cover many situations. In creating web-based applications and programming interfaces, software developers commonly use three of these communication protocols to describe the state of the network and the ways that data packets are moved across the network:\n\n\n\n*  ICMP, Internet Control Message Protocol, part of the internet protocol suite defined in RFC 792.\n*  TCP, Transmission Control Protocol\n*  UDP, User Datagram Protocol\n\n\n\nThe protocols that are used for a particular implementation of, say, an API call, can influence the overall behavior of your network. So it is worthwhile to understand the basic differences between them. If you need more information, many good articles are available on the internet with detailed descriptions of the protocols.\n\n\n\n  ICMP \n\nICMP is a control protocol, meaning that it is designed to carry information about the status of the network itself. It is essentially a network layer (OSI layer 3) error-reporting and error-control protocol for the network. The best-known examples of ICMP in practice are the ping and traceroute utilities. The ping utility uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. The traceroute utility uses ICMP to discover and trace network routes that the ICMP packets take when they travel to their destination.\n\nWhat developers need to know is that ICMP packets have no TCP or UDP port numbers that are associated with them because port numbers are a layer 4 (transport layer) construct.\n\n\n\n\n\n  TCP and UDP \n\nBoth Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are OSI layer 4 transport protocols. These protocols are used to pass the actual data. The main difference between TCP and UDP, from a developer's perspective, is how they handle packet order.\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it guarantees that all sent packets reach the destination in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, UDP is a connection-less protocol. Communication is datagram-oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach a destination and can arrive out of order, or possibly they don't arrive at all.\n\nTypically, UDP is used for real-time communication, where a little percentage of the packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-understanding-icp"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16242-7-2224", "score": 23.32501594496159, "text": "\nResponse modes \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nYou can choose a response mode for each action to set how it behaves. The modes are clarifying and confident.\n\nClarifying mode: Start here. In the clarifying mode, your assistant is eager to ask questions so you can ensure that your customer gets to the action they need. An assistant is more likely to ask questions to be sure an action matches what a customer is asking. A new or untested action gets the training that it needs.\n\nConfident mode: Take the next step. After you use analytics to improve your assistant, use the confident mode. Your assistant solves customer issues with authority and accuracy. An assistant is less likely to ask questions and is more likely to trigger actions that match. Use confident mode after you test and train actions.\n\nResponse modes are a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes on IBM Cloud only.\n\n\n\n Settings \n\nSettings for the two modes are in the global settings.

This clarification helps you ensure that the action is the right one and allows the customer to give input before proceeding. For example, if the assistant thinks that a single action named Pay Bill is the right one, it can clarify the choice by asking the customer Did you mean: Pay Bill.\n\nClarify when more than one action matches: When your assistant finds that more than one action might fulfill a customer's request, it can automatically ask for clarification.

In zone-based firewall operation an interface is assigned to a zone (only one zone per interface) and firewall rule sets are assigned to the boundaries between zones with the idea that all interfaces within a zone have the same security level and are allowed to route freely. Traffic is only scrutinized when it is passing from one zone to another.

The second rule discards and logs any traffic destined for the telnet port (tcp/23) from the address group named network-group2. The default-action indicates that anything else is accepted.\n\n\n\n\n\n Allowing data center access \n\nIBM\u00a9 offers several IP subnets to provide services and support to systems running within the data center. For example, DNS resolver services are running on 10.0.80.11 and 10.0.80.12. Other subnets are used during provisioning and support. You can find the IP ranges used in the data centers in [this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).\n\nYou can allow data center access by placing the proper SERVICE-ALLOW rules at the beginning of the firewall rule sets with an action of accept. Where the rule set must be applied depends on the routing and firewall design being implemented.\n\nIt is recommended that you place the firewall rules in the location which causes the least duplication of work.

This suggests that you might need to add types that capture the missing concepts or relationships. Be careful not to try to define a type for every concept in a field, or every entity that occurs in domain documents; the type system should be limited to only the most fundamental types.\n* An existing type is being consistently misused by human annotators. If a type consistently causes confusion, then you might need to rename it or eliminate it if it is redundant.\n* An existing type is never used by human annotators because it is never referenced in the documents. If the type is unlikely to ever be used in literature from this domain, then remove it from the type system.\n* Two types are often interchanged when human annotators annotate documents. Consider whether the two types could be consolidated into one type that accurately represents the concept or relationship. For example, if the type system contains both PERSON and PEOPLE, which are often used interchangeably, it might be best to use one type named PERSONPEOPLE that covers both cases instead of two separate types.\n\n\n\nUse caution when you update the type system.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-evaluate-ml"}]}

An example for the first type is a high change rate database. An example for the second type is a VMware\u00ae datastore.\n\nIf you take 12 hourly snapshots of 500 GB of actual data, and the change rate is 1 percent between each snapshot, you end up with 60 GB for snapshots.\n\n(5-GB Rate of Change) x (12 hourly snapshots) = (60 GB of used space)\n\nConversely, if that 500 GB of actual data, with 12 hourly snapshots, saw 10 percent of change every hour, the snapshot space that is used is 600 GB.\n\n(50-GB Rate of Change) x (12 hourly snapshots) = (600 GB of used space)\n\nSo when you determine how much Snapshot space you need, consider the rate of change carefully. It's a huge influence on how much snapshot space you need. A bigger volume is more likely to change more often. However, a 500-GB volume with 5 GB of change and a 10-TB volume with 5 GB of change use the same amount of snapshot space.\n\nAdditionally, for most workloads, the larger a volume is the less space needs to be set aside initially.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-ordering-snapshots"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05568-21632-22880", "score": 15.554638839380988, "text": "\n- name: pvmount\nmountPath: /test\nvolumes:\n- name: pvmount\npersistentVolumeClaim:\nclaimName: wasliberty\n---\n\napiVersion: policy/v1beta1\nkind: PodDisruptionBudget\nmetadata:\nname: wasliberty\nspec:\nmaxUnavailable: 1\nselector:\nmatchLabels:\napp: wasliberty\n---\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\nname: wasliberty\nlabels:\napp: wasliberty\nspec:\nports:\n- port: 9080\nselector:\napp: wasliberty\ntype: NodePort\n---\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\nname: wasliberty\nlabels:\napp: wasliberty\ndata:\nVERSION: \"1.0\"\nLANGUAGE: en\n---\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\nname: wasliberty\nlabels:\napp: wasliberty\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\nusername: dXNlcm5hbWU=\npassword: cGFzc3dvcmQ=\n---\n\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\nname: wasliberty\nannotations:\nvolume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: \"ibmc-file-bronze\"\nlabels:\nbillingType: \"hourly\"\napp: wasliberty\nspec:\naccessModes:\n- ReadWriteMany\nresources:\nrequests:\nstorage: 24Gi\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n Packaging apps for reuse in multiple environments with Kustomize \n\nAs part of a [twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/), cloud-native app, you want to maintain dev-to-prod parity by setting up a continuous development and delivery pipeline that uses a common, version-controlled code base source.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-app"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06004-1305-3196", "score": 15.522929394670026, "text": "\nStateful apps\n: Stateful apps are more complicated than stateless apps to set up, manage, and scale because the pods require persistent data and a stable network identity.

This includes the vSRX 18.4 1G SR-IOV offering. The older vSRX 18.4 1G Standard offering is based on Linux Bridging and has different network configurations on the Ubuntu host, the KVM hypervisor, and in the vSRX configuration. The host and KVM settings do not require any special migration steps, as the automation process handles the configuration changes. However, if you want to import the vSRX configuration from the legacy architecture into the current vSRX configuration, you likely need to refactor some of the configuration.\n\n\n\n Migrating 1G vSRX standalone configurations \n\nThere are some steps you potentially need to convert vSRX configuration settings on a Standalone 18.4 1G Public+Private Linux Bridge (legacy architecture) instance to a Standalone 18.4 1G Public+Private SR-IOV (current architecture) instance.\n\nYou can find a sample default configuration for SR-IOV based current architecture [in this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vsrx?topic=vsrx-understanding-the-vsrx-default-configurationdefault-configuration-of-a-sample-standalone-vsrx-gateway).\n\nThe following is a sample default configuration for the Linux Bridge (legacy architecture).

For example, an IBM Cloud\u00ae API key performs basic pipeline tasks, such as logging in to IBM Cloud. Similarly, the service ID API key writes evidence to the bucket in Cloud Object Store instance.\n\nFor security reasons, these secrets must not belong to or be affiliated with a person's identity or account because people often have greater access permissions than the toolchain automation requires. Affiliation with a person's identity or account would also violate the security principle of [least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). Also, people often change roles or even companies and their credentials must be removed which might break the toolchain automation. By using an identity that is affiliated specifically for automation purposes provides a separation of duties between automation and people who use the automation.\n\nInstead, the secrets that are used for non-IBM Cloud resources (such as GitHub Enterprise) must be affiliated with a functional ID within your enterprise with only the appropriate access that is needed by the toolchains. Likewise, secrets for IBM Cloud resources must be affiliated with an [IAM service ID API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys) that is affiliated with an [IAM service ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids). The IAM service ID access permissions should be scoped to the least privilege required by the toolchains.\n\nManaging credentials like these must be done securely and in compliance with secrets management best practices. In particular, this means vaulting the required secrets by using an approved in-boundary vault provider, such as IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager, IBM\u00ae Key Protect, or [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) and then linking your toolchain secrets to those resources.\n\nThe secrets management capabilities that are provided in the toolchain setup and pipeline user interfaces enable selection of vaulted secrets by using secrets integrations for IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager, IBM\u00ae Key Protect, or HashiCorp Vault.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-cd-devsecops-toolchains-secrets"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16456-11449-13552", "score": 25.036921782234224, "text": "\nIf annotation guidelines were previously connected to the workspace, and you want help with choosing the correct annotation to apply, click View Guidelines.

This choice is best for fields with unique or specialized terminology because this pre-annotator does not analyze the context in which the term is used in the way a machine learning pre-annotator does; it instead relies on the term being distinct enough to have a decipherable meaning regardless of the context in which it is used. For example, it is easier to recognize asbestos as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of squash, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.\n\nDictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes. Human annotators can specify entity subtypes for each pre-annotated mention by working on an [annotation task](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask) with the pre-annotated document.\n* Machine learning\n\nUses a machine learning model to automatically annotate documents.

The human annotator can change or remove the pre-annotated entity types and assign entity types to unannotated mentions. Pre-annotation by a dictionary does not annotate relations, coreferences.

However, you are not sure how to correlate what you see on your Linux\u00ae host with what you see in the console. Another example might be that you have multiple Block Storage for Classic volumes that are attached to an esxi server. You want to expand the volume size of one of the LUNs, and you need to know the correct LUN ID of the storage to do that. For OS-specific instructions, click one of the following links.\n\n\n\n* [Viewing LUN information in Linux\u00ae](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-identifyLUNidentifyLUNLin)\n* [Viewing LUN information in Windows\u00ae](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-identifyLUNidentifyLUNWin)\n* [Viewing LUN information in VMWare\u00ae](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-identifyLUNidentifyLUNVMware)\n\n\n\n* Can I get storage performance metrics (IOPS or latency) from the Support teams?\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae does not provide storage performance IOPS and latency metrics. Customers are expected to monitor their own Block Storage for Classic devices by using their choice of third-party monitoring tools.\n\nThe following examples are utilities that you might consider to use to check performance statistics.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs?tab=faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13464-7165-8908", "score": 14.745543520306477, "text": "\nTS_CROSS_CORRELATION(DoubleTimeSeries, DoubleTimeSeries)\n: Output: DoubleArray\n: Use a [cross correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) algorithm to return a measure of the similarity of two time series.\n\nTS_SEG_CROSS_CORRELATION(DoubleSegmentTimeSeries, DoubleSegmentTimeSeries)\n: Output: DoubleArrayTimeSeries\n: Use a [cross correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) algorithm to return a measure of the similarity of each pair of corresponding segments in the two input time series.

Your assistant can learn from these user decisions.\n\nFor example, a customer might ask a question that the assistant isn't sure it understands. The assistant asks a clarifying question so the customer can choose the right action from a list. If customers most often click the same action (option #2, for example), your assistant can learn that option #2 is the best answer.\n\nNext time, the assistant can list option #2 as the first choice, so customers can get to it more quickly. If the pattern persists over time, it can change its behavior even more. Your assistant can return option #2 immediately, rather than asking a clarifying question.\n\nAs your assistant learns over time, your customers get the best answer more often and in fewer clicks.\n\n\n\n How autolearning works \n\nBefore your assistant can learn from customer behavior, it must observe a significant amount of real conversation data. The conversations take place in a channel such as the web chat, or in a custom application.\n\nLogs of conversations and user decisions from your live environment are the data source for observation. Your assistant analyzes the logs to gain insights. (It doesn't watch real-time clicks during a conversation.)\n\nWhen the assistant observes enough real conversation data from the live environment, it gains insights to help improve your assistant, providing a better customer experience.\n\nWhen you publish your assistant to the live environment, autolearning starts training the assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Applying autolearning \n\nYou can apply autolearning when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n* Ask clarifying questions is enabled in global settings. For more information, see [Asking clarifying questions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-understand-questionsunderstand-questions-ask-clarifying-question).\n* You publish a version of your assistant to the live environment.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-autolearn"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03312-1841-4150", "score": 23.987980613531914, "text": "\nWatson Assistant analytics provide overview statistics on the number of interactions with users and containment rates.

To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload, such as by [resizing your worker pools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workersresize_pool).\n\nWhat happens to my worker node during an update?\n: Your VPC worker node is replaced by removing the old worker node and provisioning a new worker node that runs at the updated patch or major.minor version. The replacement worker node is created in the same zone, same worker pool, and with the same flavor as the deleted worker node. However, the replacement worker node is assigned a new private IP address, and loses any custom labels or taints that you applied to the old worker node (worker pool labels and taints are still applied to the replacement worker node).\n\nWhat if I replace multiple worker nodes at the same time?\n: If you replace multiple worker nodes at the same time, they are deleted and replaced concurrently, not one by one. Make sure that you have enough capacity in your cluster to reschedule your workloads before you replace worker nodes.\n\nWhat if a replacement worker node is not created?\n: A replacement worker node is not created if the worker pool does not have [automatic rebalancing enabled](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-auto-rebalance-off).\n\n\n\n Prerequisites", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11770-5930-7773", "score": 14.767517709741849, "text": "\nYou can also perform a rolling update of your worker node hosts with a ConfigMap.\n\nBefore you begin\n\n\n\n* Verify that all your worker nodes are in a healthy state.\n* If you are using persistent block storage volumes, you must detach these volumes from the node before you start your updates.

These services, called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), are packaged as virtual machines (VMs) on commodity hardware, which allows service providers to run their networks on standard servers instead of proprietary ones. This third-party software interacts with the IBM Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller to offer easy configuration, centralized management, and lower operational costs.\n\nWorking along with IBM Cloud\u00ae Schematics (Infrastructure as Code) and the IBM Content catalog, customers are able to instantiate best-in-network solutions to manage their workload.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n\n\n*  Instantiating virtual network services and modifying configurations without the need to deploy new network hardware.\n*  Rapid service delivery with the agility to scale well above physical hardware.\n*  Centralized policy control.\n*  Using the same routers, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs in IBM Cloud that were used in physical hardware or other cloud providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vnf"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16030-7-2126", "score": 17.354973425989584, "text": "\nVPC behind the curtain \n\nThe following information presents a detailed conceptual picture of what's happening \"behind the curtain\" in VPC networking. Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16026-0-358", "score": 16.479052726526444, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  VNF limitations \n\nHigh Availability (HA) Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployments have the following known limitations.\n\n\n\n*  The Virtual Network Function (VNF) must share one subnet with the Network Load Balancer (NLB).\n*  Routing public internet \"ingress\" traffic to a VNF is not supported.\n*  Auto-scaling with the VNF is not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vnf-limitations"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07953-7-2429", "score": 15.706912046680525, "text": "\nEnsuring isolation between Satellite management functions and workload functions \n\nA key aspect of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services is to separate user workloads from system management functions and isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.

Place control plane hosts into a separate network segment. Control plane hosts support various management and security-related components of the Satellite location. To facilitate effective network flow restrictions within the Satellite location, it is recommended to place control plane hosts into a separate network segment (whether physical or virtual) that can enable clear identification of source or destination of the network flows related to control plane functionality. The control plane hosts can be deployed to different physical locations, but the address space they are assigned to should provide an easy way to identify this group of hosts (for example, CIDR blocks).\n2. Designate a separate network segment for each group of Satellite hosts assigned to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud workload clusters. Satellite hosts that are assigned to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud workload clusters (workload hosts) should use their own network segments that would enable network flow control and monitoring between workload hosts, control plane, and other components outside of the Satellite location. It is recommended to designate a separate network segment (virtual subnet, VLAN, or a similar entity) for each group of Satellite hosts assigned to the same workload cluster.\n3.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-connectivity-management-isolation"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16030-4758-6868", "score": 15.683874973851204, "text": "\nInter-subnet, inter-zone data flows - For these flows, the implicit router function removes the VNI and forwards the packet in the VPC's MPLS VPN for transit across the cloud backbone. At the destination zone, the implicit router function tags the data packet with the appropriate VNI. Then, the packet is forwarded to the destination hypervisor, where the VNI is stripped off again so that the data packet can be forwarded to the destination virtual server instance.\n\nExtra-vpc service data flows - Packets that are destined for IaaS or IBM Cloud Service Endpoint (CSE) services use the VPC's implicit router function. They also use a network address translation (NAT) function. The translation function replaces the virtual server instance address with an IPv4 address that identifies the VPC to the IaaS or CSE service that is requested.\n\nExtra-vpc internet data flows - Packets that are destined for the internet are the most complex. In addition to using the VPC's implicit router function, each of these flows also rely on one of the implicit router's two network address translation (NAT) functions.\n\n\n\n* An explicit one-to-many NAT through a public gateway function that serves all subnets that are connected to it.\n* One-to-one NAT assigned to individual virtual server instances.\n\n\n\nAfter NAT translation, the implicit router forwards these internet-destined packets to the internet, by using the cloud backbone.\n\n\n\n\n\n Life cycle of external IP addresses that are associated with public gateway functions \n\nAs both external IP addresses and PGWs are bound to an availability zone.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16298-6367-7794", "score": 33.96413346268509, "text": "\nFor more information see [Securing the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security).\n2.

This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

For more information about the preview link, see [Copying a link to share](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-preview-sharepreview-share-link).\n\nTo enable security, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16375-1468-2933", "score": 26.501693730061973, "text": "\n// A UUID like '1d7e34d5-3952-4b86-90eb-7c7232b9b540' included in the embed code provided in Watson Assistant.\nintegrationID: \"YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID\",\n// Your assistants region e.g. 'us-south', 'us-east', 'jp-tok' 'au-syd', 'eu-gb', 'eu-de', etc.\nregion: \"YOUR_REGION\",\n// A UUID like '6435434b-b3e1-4f70-8eff-7149d43d938b' included in the embed code provided in Watson Assistant.\nserviceInstanceID: \"YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID\",\n// The callback function that is called after the widget instance has been created.\nonLoad: function(instance) {\ninstance.render();\n},\nshowLauncher: false, // Hide the web chat launcher, you will open the WebView from your mobile application\nopenChatByDefault: true, // When the web chat WebView is opened, the web chat will already be open and ready to go.\nhideCloseButton: true // And the web chat will not show a close button, instead relying on the controls to close the WebView\n};\nsetTimeout(function(){const t=document.createElement('script');t.src=\"https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/versions/\" + (window.watsonAssistantChatOptions.clientVersion || 'latest') + \"/WatsonAssistantChatEntry.js\";document.head.appendChild(t);});\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\nShow more\n\nIn your app, make sure you include logic to hide your web chat launching mechanism when the device is offline.

If you want to change the size or position of the web chat, you can specify a custom element as the host location for the web chat. This host element is used as the location for both the main web chat interface and for the web chat launcher (unless you are using a custom launcher).\n\nWhen you use a custom element, you also take control of showing and hiding the web chat when it is opened or closed (such as when the customer clicks the launcher icon or the minimize button). This gives you the opportunity to apply additional effects, such as opening and closing animations. You can control showing and hiding the main window by using the [addClassName() and removeClassName()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodselements-get-main-window) functions.\n\nTo use a custom element, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. In your website code, define the custom element where you want the web chat to be rendered. There are many ways of doing this, depending on the framework you are using. A simple example is to define an empty HTML element with an ID:\n\n<div id=\"WebChatContainer\"></div>\n2. Get a reference to your custom element so you can reference it in the web chat configuration. To get a reference, use whatever mechanism makes sense for the library you are using. For example, you can save the reference returned from document.createElement(), or you can use a query function to look up the element in the DOM.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-size-position"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-25179-26743", "score": 26.316154793121648, "text": "\nfunction mockLogin() {\nconst payload = {\n/\n* Even if this is an unauthenticated user, add a userID in the sub claim that can be used\n* for billing purposes.\n* This ID will help us keep track \"unique users\".

After you enable web chat security, any messages that are not signed with the proper private key are rejected.\n\nIn your website HTML, update the web chat embed script to specify a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever the existing JWT expires. The simplest way to do this is to subscribe to the [identityTokenExpired](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-eventsidentityexpired) event and generate a new JWT when that event is received. The identityTokenExpired event is fired in both of the following situations:\n\n\n\n* At the beginning of a new session, if no JWT was provided using the identityToken configuration option.\n* When the previously specified JWT expires.\n\n\n\nIn your onLoad event handler, use the [on()](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodson) instance method to subscribe to the identityTokenExpired event.\n\nIn the callback, call the function on your server that you implemented to generate a new JWT.

You can skip this step as long as you perform the next step where you add the identityTokenExpired event. The event is fired when the web chat is first opened, and if a token wasn't provided, it obtains one from your handler at that time.\n\nFor example:\n\n<script>\nwindow.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {\nintegrationID: 'YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID',\nregion: 'YOUR_REGION',\nserviceInstanceID: 'YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE',\nidentityToken: 'YOUR_JWT',\nonLoad: function(instance) {\ninstance.render();\n}\n};\nsetTimeout(function(){\nconst t=document.createElement('script');", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16377-1361-3020", "score": 26.204786441098992, "text": "\nTo create a post-chat form, follow the same steps, but subscribe to the window:pre:close event instead of the window:open event.\n\nTo display a pre-chat form, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

It uses a dictionary lookup approach to match a word from the user input to an existing entity value or synonym in the skill's training data. For example, if the user enters boook, and your training data contains a @reading_material entity with a book value, then fuzzy matching recognizes that the two terms (boook and book) mean the same thing.\n\nIn dialog, when you enable both autocorrection and fuzzy matching, the fuzzy matching function runs before autocorrection is triggered. If it finds a term that it can match to an existing dictionary entity value or synonym, it adds the term to the list of words that belong to the skill, and does not correct it.\n\nFor example, if a user enters a sentence like I wnt to buy a boook, fuzzy matching recognizes that the term boook means the same thing as your entity value book, and adds it to the protected words list.

And thanks to autocorrection revising the term to want, your assistant is able to map the input to your buy_something intent. Each feature does its part to help your assistant understand the meaning of the user input.\n\n\n\n\n\n How autocorrection works \n\nNormally, user input is saved as-is in the text field of the input object of the message. If, and only if the user input is corrected in some way, a new field is created in the input object, called original_text. This field stores the user's original input that includes any misspelled words in it. And the corrected text is added to the input.text field.\n\nIf you want to ask users to confirm the assistant's understanding of their meaning, you can do so in a way that takes into account that their input might have been corrected.

Peers and ordering nodes take longer to deploy, but this condition can also occur when the health checker that runs against the peer or ordering nodes cannot contact the node.

These features are available for both the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.\n\nThe features involve the use of elements of the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). The descriptions of the features provide information about how they interact with related SSML elements and attributes.\n\n\n\n Using speaking styles \n\nThe expressive neural voices determine the sentiment of the text from the context of its words and phrases. The speech that they produce, in addition to having a very conversational style, reflects the mood of the text. The expressive voices naturally express gratitude, thankfulness, happiness, empathy, confusion, and other sentiments by default, with no explicit additional tagging.\n\nHowever, you can embellish the voices' natural tendencies by using the <express-as> element with the required style attribute to indicate that all or some of the text is to emphasize specific characteristics. These characteristics are referred to as speaking styles:\n\n\n\n* cheerful - Expresses happiness and good news. The style is upbeat, welcoming, and conveys a positive message.\n* empathetic - Expresses empathy and compassion. The style has sympathetic undertones, but it is not excessively sorrowful.\n* neutral - Expresses objectivity and evenness. The style strives for less emotion, and instead conveys a more even and instructional tone.\n* uncertain - Expresses uncertainty and confusion. The style conveys the feeling of being unsure or in doubt.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the effect of the styles is very subtle. In such cases, the differences might not be readily discernible from the default expressive tone. But there are instances where the style can audibly enhance the voices' inherent ability to detect and express emotion. The differences are often detectable only on certain words and phrases.\n\nTable 1 provides examples of each available style for the <express-as> element. To demonstrate the effect of the styles, the table provides two samples for each example.

As such, both accented and non-accented versions of words might be treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.\n\nHowever for some languages, like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity might implicitly have an accent, your assistant can also match the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score.\n\nFor example, for the word \"barri\u00f3\", which has an accent and corresponds to the past tense of the verb \"barrer\" (to sweep), your assistant can also match the word \"barrio\" (neighborhood), but with a slightly lower confidence.\n\nThe system will provide the highest confidence scores in entities with exact matches. For example, barrio will not be detected if barri\u00f3 is in the training set; and barri\u00f3 will not be detected if barrio is in the training set.\n\nYou are expected to train the system with the proper characters and accents. For example, if you are expecting barri\u00f3 as a response, then you should put barri\u00f3 into the training set.\n\nAlthough not an accent mark, the same applies to words using, for example, the Spanish letter \u00f1 vs. the letter n, such as \"u\u00f1a\" vs. \"una\".

A custom model is a dictionary of words and their translations for a specific language. Each word/translation pair in a model tells the service how to pronounce a word when it occurs in input text.\n\nYou can use custom models to create application-specific translations for unusual words for which the service's regular pronunciation rules might yield imperfect pronunciations. For example, your application might routinely encounter domain-specific terms, special terms with foreign origins, personal or geographic names, or abbreviations and acronyms.

What questions or tasks will it help customers with? To make an informed decision, review any support call logs that you have access to.\n\nStart small. Pick one or a handful of customer issues that will deliver the highest value to start.\n\nIt might be valuable for your assistant to answer a simple question that is asked all the time. Or maybe there's a task, such as scheduling appointments, that can be offloaded to the assistant to tackle 30% of all incoming customer requests.\n\nChoose a narrow set of user goals first.

The web chat serves as the client interface for your assistant. If, in the course of a conversation with your assistant, a customer asks to speak to a person, you can transfer the conversation directly to a Zendesk agent.\n\nZendesk Chat lets you help customers in real time, which increases customer satisfaction. And satisfied customers are happier customers. To learn more about this service desk solution, see the [Zendesk website](https://www.zendesk.com/chat/).\n\nZendesk Chat is an add-on to Zendesk Support. Zendesk Support puts all your customer support interactions in one place, so communication is seamless, personal, and efficient, which means more productive agents and satisfied customers.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\n\n\n1. You must have a Zendesk account. If not, create one.\n\nA Zendesk Chat Enterprise plan is required.\n2. Decide whether you want to enable security.\n\nIf you choose to enable security in Zendesk, you must collect the name and email address of each user. This information must be passed to the web chat so it can be provided to Zendesk when the conversation is transferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting up the Zendesk service desk connection \n\nTo set up a Zendesk service desk integration, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Create a web chat integration. For more information, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n2.
