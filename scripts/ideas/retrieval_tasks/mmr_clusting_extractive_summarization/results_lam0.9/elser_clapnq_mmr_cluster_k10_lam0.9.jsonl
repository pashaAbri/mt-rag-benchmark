Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . After a series of league mergers and folds , it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 .", "title": "Stanley Cup", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "798029343_451-1065-0-614", "score": 16.193016, "text": "America's Cup\nThe America 's Cup , affectionately known as the `` Auld Mug '' , is a trophy awarded to the winner of the America 's Cup match races between two sailing yachts .

Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) .

Although proper use of glycerine reduced bacterial contamination considerably the crude starting material , scraped from the skin of infected calves , was always heavily contaminated and no vaccine was totally free from bacteria . A survey of vaccines in 1900 found wide variations in bacterial contamination . Vaccine issued by the Government Vaccine Establishment contained 5,000 bacteria per gram , while commercial vaccines contained up to 100,000 per gram . The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1925 set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram , and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections . Unfortunately glycerolated vaccine soon lost its potency at ambient temperatures which restricted its use in tropical climates . However , it remained in use into the 1970s where a satisfactory cold chain was available . Animals continued to be widely used by vaccine producers during the Smallpox Eradication Campaign . A WHO survey of 59 producers , some of whom used more than one source of vaccine , found that 39 used calves , 12 used sheep and 6 used water buffalo , whilst only 3 made vaccine in cell culture and 3 in embryonated hens ' eggs . English vaccine was occasionally made in sheep during World War I but from 1946 only sheep were used .", "title": "Smallpox vaccine", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "855533381_55716-57147-0-1431", "score": 17.50007, "text": "Virus\nVaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses . Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses . Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity ( illness ) and mortality ( death ) associated with viral infections such as polio , measles , mumps and rubella . Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_38877-39736-0-859", "score": 17.431429, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases .

They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis , since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria . Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which , like humans and other primates , can not synthesize vitamin C , but must obtain it from their diet , they are ideal for researching scurvy .

One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea , leading people to think they had originated there . `` Guinea '' was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far - off , unknown country , so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal 's exotic appeal . Another hypothesis suggests the `` guinea '' in the name is a corruption of `` Guiana '' , an area in South America . A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin ; this hypothesis is untenable , because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663 , and William Harvey used the term `` Ginny - pig '' as early as 1653 .

This derives from the Middle High German name merswin . This originally meant `` dolphin '' and was used because of the animals ' grunting sounds ( which were thought to be similar ) . Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) . The Chinese refer to them as \u8c5a\u9f20 ( t\u00fansh\u01d4 , ' pig mouse ' ) , and sometimes as Netherlands pig ( \u8377\u862d \u8c6c , h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b ) or Indian mouse ( \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 , ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4 ) . The Japanese word for guinea pig is `` \u30e2\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8 '' ( morumotto ) , which derives from the name of another mountain - dwelling rodent , the marmot ; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843 .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_588-1089-0-501", "score": 25.737766, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also known as cavy or domestic cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_1090-1588-0-498", "score": 24.686296, "text": "Guinea pig\nThe domestic guinea pig plays an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean groups , especially as a food source , but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner .

This changed with the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 , which provided for comprehensive planning , technical services , research , and financial assistance by the federal government to state and local governments for sanitary infrastructure . The Act was amended in 1965 , establishing a uniform set of water quality standards and creating a Federal Water Pollution Control Administration authorized to set standards where states failed to do so . Comprehensive federal regulations for water supply and sanitation were introduced in the 1970s , in reaction to an increase in environmental concerns . In 1970 EPA was created by the Richard Nixon administration , and authority for managing various environmental programs was transferred to the new agency . In 1972 , Congress passed the Clean Water Act , requiring industrial plants and municipal sewage plants to proactively improve their waste treatment practices in order to limit the effect of contaminants on freshwater sources . In 1974 , the Safe Drinking Water Act was adopted for the regulation of public water systems . This law specified a number of contaminants that must be closely monitored and reported to residents should they exceed the maximum contaminant levels allowed . From then on , drinking water systems were closely monitored by federal , state , and municipal governments for safety and compliance with existing regulations . The Clean Water Act set the unprecedented goal of eliminating all water pollution by 1985 and authorized massive expenditures of $24.6 billion in research and construction grants for municipal sewage treatment .

The need for irrigation led the Sumerians , and later the Akkadians , to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers . Major cities , such as Ur and Uruk , took root on tributaries of the Euphrates , while others , notably Lagash , were built on branches of the Tigris . The rivers provided the further benefits of fish ( used both for food and fertilizer ) , reeds , and clay ( for building materials ) . With irrigation , the food supply in Mesopotamia was compabale to the Canadian prairies . The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the Fertile Crescent , which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile . Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops , portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable . This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia . Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts . Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley , onions , grapes , turnips , and apples . Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine . As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian , farmers did not depend on slaves to complete farm work for them , but there were some exceptions . There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical ( i.e. the escape / mutiny of the slave ) . Although the rivers sustained life , they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities . The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers ; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept .

She did not appear to be angered at this . After an awkward silence , Toby announces his move to Costa Rica . In `` Goodbye , Toby '' Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her ( because she took the picture herself ) for when he leaves for Costa Rica . Toby , unsatisfied by the lack of her presence , shouts at the office staff asking for a camera ( possibly the loudest he 's ever spoken ) . When no one responds , he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together .

At the end of the episode , Pam comments ( though not to Toby ) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot . In `` Niagara '' Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding . He is later disappointed when the wedding is called back on but is seen smiling and clapping after they 're married and run down the aisle . During `` Roy 's Wedding '' , while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there 's anything they do n't know about each other , Toby correctly answers facts about Pam .

There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby offered his help and notably in `` Paper Airplane '' after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing ( to which Toby apologizes ) . Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporally blinding Toby . In the series finale , while dancing with Pam , Toby began sobbing . Pam questions Toby with `` Is it me ? Is it Nellie ? '' Toby shakes his head , and responds with `` It 's everything .

A syndicated edition of Jeopardy ! , distributed by Metromedia and featuring many contestants who were previously champions on the original series , aired in the primetime during the 1974 -- 1975 season . The NBC daytime series was later revived as The All - New Jeopardy ! , which premiered on October 2 , 1978 and aired 108 episodes , ending on March 2 , 1979 ; this revival featured significant rule changes , such as progressive elimination of contestants over the course of the main game , and a bonus round instead of Final Jeopardy !", "title": "Jeopardy!", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "854629410_40317-41141-0-824", "score": 16.719307, "text": "Jeopardy!\nIn 1989 , Fleming expressed dissatisfaction with the daily syndicated Jeopardy ! series in an essay published in Sports Illustrated .

Fleming believed that , in contrast to New Yorkers who Fleming considered to be more intelligent and authentic , moving the show to Hollywood brought both an unrealistic glamour and a dumbing - down of the program that he disdained . He also disliked the decision to not award losing contestants their cash earnings ( believing the parting gifts offered instead to be cheap ) and expressed surprise that what he considered to be a parlor game had transformed into such a national phenomenon under Trebek .", "title": "Jeopardy!", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "854629410_49721-54856-3050-5134", "score": 16.654137, "text": "Jeopardy!\n, in which the host and two of the three contestants are stereotypical black Americans and the categories and clues likewise reflect black American culture .

Jeopardy ! is featured in a subplot of the 1992 film White Men Ca n't Jump , in which Gloria Clemente ( Rosie Perez ) attempts to pass the show 's auditions . She succeeds , and ends up appearing on the show , winning over $14,000 . The Univision Deportes program F\u00fatbol Club features a segment similar to Jeopardy ! named `` Yoperdy !

In the David Foster Wallace short story `` Little Expressionless Animals '' , first published in The Paris Review and later reprinted in Wallace 's collection Girl with Curious Hair , the character Julie Smith competes and wins on every Jeopardy ! game for three years ( a total of 700 episodes ) and then uses her winnings to pay for the care of her brother , who has autism . The Ellen 's Energy Adventure attraction at Epcot 's Universe of Energy pavilion featured a dream sequence in which Ellen DeGeneres plays a Jeopardy ! game entirely focused on energy .

On January 16 , Daniels revealed that Carell would not appear in the finale in any capacity , a decision that Carell later reiterated . Three months later , however , the producers for The Office mounted `` an 11th - hour effort last month '' to get Carell to make a cameo in the show 's final episode , according to TVLine . Carell 's personal representative confirmed that Carell was on the set for the final episode , but that he did not film any scenes . However , an anonymous source close to the show cryptically said `` do n't rule anything out '' . TVLine later reported on May 6 , that Carell would appear in a cameo , although NBC declined to comment and Carell 's representatives continued to deny the reports . Carell , however , did end up returning for the finale ; his character , Michael Scott , becomes Dwight 's best man at his wedding . A month after the episode aired , Carell explained in an interview with TVLine that he `` lied for months to the press , to almost everyone , really '' . He noted that he `` felt terribly for the cast and for ( executive producer ) Greg Daniels , because they all lied , too . '' Krasinski , on the other hand , explained that `` It was so thrilling . We all just flat - out lied ... It was just one of those things that we all vowed and had to protect '' .

Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income , and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large - scale municipal fairs . Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol , and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken . The animal may be served fried ( chactado or frito ) , broiled ( asado ) , or roasted ( al horno ) , and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .", "title": "Guinea pig", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "850931827_2155-2640-0-485", "score": 18.411852, "text": "Guinea pig\nBiological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV / AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_32203-33897-0-1694", "score": 15.813336, "text": "Infertility\nHigh costs may also be a factor and research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology , in Belgium , claimed a much lower cost methodology ( about 90 % reduction ) with similar efficacy , which may be suitable for some fertility treatment .

Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible . Additionally , counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment , and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well . While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations ( such as sub-Saharan African countries ) , a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention . The lack of fertility treatment is problematic , and high birth and population rates are every reason to implement treatment options rather than reject them .", "title": "Infertility", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "836413300_4807-5241-0-434", "score": 15.596212, "text": "Infertility\nThese time intervals would seem to be reversed ; this is an area where public policy trumps science .

Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies .

The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over-running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 -- 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( \u6210 \u5468 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 -- 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1,400 metres ( 4,600 feet ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in Hancheng , Shaanxi .

More positions were set up in the years up Hongwu 's death in 1398 , and watchtowers were manned from the Bohai Sea to Beijing and further onto the Mongolian steppes . These positions , however , were not for a linear defence but rather a regional one in which walls did not feature heavily , and offensive tactics remained the overarching policy at the time . In 1421 , the Ming capital was relocated from Nanjing in the south to Beijing in the north , partly to better manage the Mongol situation . Thus defenses were concentrated around Beijing , where stone and earth began to replace rammed earth in strategic passes . A wall was erected by the Ming in Liaodong to protect Han settlers from a possible threat from the Jurched - Mongol Oriyanghan around 1442 .

At around 1,530,000 square kilometres ( 590,000 sq mi ) , India has the second - largest amount of arable land , after the US , with 52 % of total land under cultivation . Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China . However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate . The average size of land holdings is very small , with 70 % of holdings being less than one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) in size . Irrigation facilities are inadequate , as revealed by the fact that only 46 % of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016 , resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall , specifically the monsoon season , which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country . In an effort to bring an additional two crore hectares ( 20 million hectares ; 50 million acres ) of land under irrigation , various schemes have been attempted , including the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme ( AIBP ) which was provided \u20b9 80,000 crore ( \u20b9 800 billion ) in the union budget .

The introduction of high - yielding varieties of seeds after 1965 and the increased use of fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green Revolution , which provided the increase in production needed to make India self - sufficient in food grains . The program was started with the help of the United States - based Rockefeller Foundation and was based on high - yielding varieties of wheat , rice , and other grains that had been developed in Mexico and in the Philippines . Of the high - yielding seeds , wheat produced the best results . Production of coarse grains -- the staple diet of the poor -- and pulses -- the main source of protein -- lagged behind , resulting in reduced per capita availability . The total area under the high - yielding - varieties program was a negligible 1.9 million hectares in FY 1960 . Since then growth has been spectacular , increasing to nearly 15.4 million hectares by FY 1970 , 43.1 million hectares by FY 1980 , and 63.9 million hectares by FY 1990 . The rate of growth decreased significantly in the late 1980s , however , as additional suitable land was not available ( see table 32 , Appendix ) . The major benefits of the Green Revolution were experienced mainly in northern and northwestern India between 1965 and the early 1980s ; the program resulted in a substantial increase in the production of food grains , mainly wheat and rice . Food - grain yields continued to increase throughout the 1980s , but the dramatic changes in the years between 1965 and 1980 were not duplicated . By FY 1980 , almost 75 percent of the total cropped area under wheat was sown with high - yielding varieties . For rice the comparable figure was 45 percent . In the 1980s , the area under high - yielding varieties continued to increase , but the rate of growth overall was slower . The eighth plan aimed at making high - yielding varieties available to the whole country and developing more productive strains of other crops . The Green Revolution created wide regional and interstate disparities . The plan was implemented only in areas with assured supplies of water and the means to control it , large inputs of fertilizers , and adequate farm credit . These inputs were easily available in at least parts of the states of Punjab , Haryana , and western Uttar Pradesh ; thus , yields increased most in these states .", "title": "Green Revolution in India", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "846588693_3711-4082-0-371", "score": 18.661802, "text": "Green Revolution in India\nThe production of wheat has produced the best results in fueling self - sufficiency of India .

Reviewing a production of Macbeth in Beijing in 1980 , one Chinese critic , Xu Xiaozhong praised Macbeth as the story of `` how the greed for power finally ruined a great man '' .

By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .", "title": "Celts", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "852484941_59328-59737-0-409", "score": 19.739223, "text": "Celts\nLike other European Iron Age tribal societies , the Celts practised a polytheistic religion .

Equivalent to exchanging vows in the west , the couple would pay respect to the Jade Emperor , the patron family deities ( or patron buddhas and bodhisattvas ) , paying respect to deceased ancestors , the bride and groom 's parents and other elders , and paying respect to each other . Then , the new couple would go to their bridal chamber and guests would be treated to a feast . Wedding banquets In Chinese society , the wedding banquet is known as x\u01d0 - j\u01d0u ( \u559c\u9152 , lit . joyful wine ) , and is sometimes far more important than the actual wedding itself .

One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal , built to link the Midwest to the Port of New York , a significant seaport during that time . The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West , allowing settlers to travel west , send goods to markets in frontier cities , and export goods via the Hudson River and New York City . The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation , surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts . After the completion of the Erie Canal , smaller canals were built to connect it with the new system . The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain . This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway , and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City . Another major canal was the Oswego Canal , which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario , and could be used to bypass Niagara Falls . The Cayuga - Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake . Farther south , the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale , Pennsylvania , and the Hudson River at Kingston , New York .

Another theory sees the rhyme as connected to Mary , Queen of Scots ( 1542 -- 1587 ) , with `` how does your garden grow '' referring to her reign over her realm , `` silver bells '' referring to ( Catholic ) cathedral bells , `` cockle shells '' insinuating that her husband was not faithful to her , and `` pretty maids all in a row '' referring to her ladies - in - waiting -- `` The four Maries '' . In Disney 's The Truth About Mother Goose the `` silver bells '' are said to `` refer to the elaborate decoration on her dresses '' , the `` cockle shells '' to her love of exotic food such as cockles , with the `` pretty maids all in a row '' referring to her ladies - in - waiting .

These units were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914 , but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915 . Aerial photography was attempted during 1914 , but again , it only became effective the following year . In August 1915 , General Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson . The British use of air power evolved during the war , from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of the air above the trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind the line . The early aircraft of the RFC were inferior to their German rivals ; in April 1917 , ( known as Bloody April ) , the RFC lost over 300 aircrew and 245 aircraft .
