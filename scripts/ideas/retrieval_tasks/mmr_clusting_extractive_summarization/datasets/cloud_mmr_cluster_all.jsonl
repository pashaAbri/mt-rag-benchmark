Data Integrity: Immutable Object Storage maintains data integrity in a WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) manner, ensuring that objects can't be modified until the end of their retention period and the removal of any legal holds.\n2. Long-term Data Retention: This feature can be used by any user that needs long-term data retention in their environment, including but not limited to organizations in industries like Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives.\n3. Legal Compliance: Immutable Object Storage is useful for organizations that deal with financial records management, such as broker-dealer transactions, and might need to store data in a non-rewritable and non-erasable format due to legal or compliance reasons.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Regional Availability: Immutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only, which might limit its accessibility for some users.\n2. Pricing: It requires a Standard pricing plan, which might be more expensive than other storage options.\n3. No Aspera High-speed Transfer: It isn't possible to use Aspera high-speed transfer with buckets with a retention policy.\n4. Inalterability: Once a retention period is set, it cannot be altered until the period expires, which could potentially cause issues if changes need to be made before the retention period ends.\n\nPlease note that the actual advantages and disadvantages might vary depending on the specific use case and requirements."}

You can also use the `*` symbol to select all columns in a table.\n3. `FROM` keyword: indicates the table(s) from which you want to retrieve data.\n4. Optional constraints: such as `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses. These constraints allow you to filter, aggregate, and sort the data.\n\nHere is an example of a basic SQL query definition:\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2\nFROM table_name\nWHERE condition;\n```\nIn addition, the documents provided also mention the use of common table expressions (CTEs) in queries. A CTE is a temporary result set that is defined within a single execution of a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. It can be used to simplify complex queries or to improve query performance.

Use appropriate indexing: Indexes can significantly improve query performance. However, adding too many indexes can have a negative impact on data insertion and updates. Therefore, it's important to find a balance.\n2. Optimize query logic: Avoid using subqueries when possible, as they can slow down query performance. Instead, use joins or temporary tables. Also, try to minimize the use of the `DISTINCT` keyword, as it can also affect performance.\n3. Limit the number of rows returned: If you only need a specific number of rows, use the `LIMIT` keyword to limit the number of rows returned by the query.\n4. Use the `EXPLAIN` statement: The `EXPLAIN` statement can provide information about how the SQL server optimizes your query. This can help you identify performance issues and optimize your query.\n5. Avoid using wildcard characters at the beginning of a search term: Wildcard characters at the beginning of a search term can slow down query performance. If possible, try to rewrite the query to avoid using wildcard characters at the beginning of a search term.\n\nRegarding your specific query, without knowing the details of the query and the database schema, it's difficult to provide specific advice.

However, I can provide you with some general details about using APIs with SQL queries.\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) allows for programmatic access to a service or application. In the context of SQL queries, an API enables you to submit queries and retrieve results using code. Commonly, SQL query APIs provide endpoints for running queries, managing database schema, and handling authentication and authorization.\n\nTo use a SQL query API, you typically need to send HTTP requests to the API's endpoints. These requests may include parameters for query definition, input data, and output settings. The API will then process the query and return the results, often in a structured format like JSON or CSV.\n\nFor the IBM Cloud Data Engine, you can use the Data Engine REST API to run queries and retrieve information about their status. This is especially helpful when writing code that automatically queries data. To get started with the Data Engine REST API, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/sql-query/sql-query-v3).\n\nKeep in mind that each SQL query API may have its specific authentication, authorization, and usage requirements. Make sure to consult the relevant documentation for detailed information.\n\nIn summary, while the provided documents do not contain specific details about a query API for IBM Cloud Data Engine or SQL queries, you can use the Data Engine REST API to run queries and retrieve information about their status.

It is a centralized repository that allows for the storage and analysis of large volumes of structured and unstructured data from various sources. Data lakes often use object storage as a scalable and cost-effective solution for storing raw data files. Once the data is stored, data analysts can query data where it lies using Structured Query Language (SQL) with the help of services such as Data Engine. This approach enables data analysts to refine and analyze data while allowing non-technical users to access data through application(s). Ultimately, data lakes provide a flexible and efficient way for organizations to manage and derive insights from their data. The provided document, \"Build a data lake using object storage,\" offers a tutorial on creating a data lake for your organization using IBM Cloud Object Storage and Data Engine."}

It is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the `firstname` is \"Charles\" and the `surname` is \"Dickens\":\n```json\n{\n  \"selector\": {\n    \"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n    \"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n  },\n  \"limit\": 10\n}\n```\nTo create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query, you can call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body. For example, to create an index for the `firstname` and `surname` fields, you can use the following JSON index definition:\n```json\n{\n  \"index\": {\n    \"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n  },\n  \"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\"\n}\n```\nIf you need to access objects within documents, you can use standard dot notation for example, `address.zipcode` to access a postal code string inside an `address` object. Additionally, you can specify the `fields`, `sort`, and `limit` parameters to define the document attributes you want returned, how the data is to be sorted, and the number of documents to return.\n\nIf you are from a relational database background, you can think of the `WHERE` clause as the equivalent of the `selector` in IBM Cloudant Query, `ORDER` as the equivalent of `sort`, and `LIMIT` as the equivalent of `limit`. The IBM Cloudant Query `FIELDS` list is equivalent to the comma-separated list of attributes after the `SELECT` keyword in an SQL query."}

To grant access to your resources, you can configure IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for IBM Cloud Container Registry. For more information, see the [Granting access to IBM Cloud Container Registry resources tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iam_access) and [Managing IAM access for Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iam).\n\nIf you have specific questions about granting access to the Container Registry, I am here to help. Here are some frequently asked questions:\n\n* How can I share an image with many users? You can create an IBM Cloud account and invite all the users to it. They can then all have access to any namespace that is created in the account. You can create a subset of the users and set an IAM access policy to differentiate access at the namespace level. Users can be members of many accounts, but you can't give access outside the account, that is, you can't share a namespace to multiple accounts.\n* Do I have any untagged images? To find out whether you have any untagged images, list your images by running the [ibmcloud cr image-digests](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-containerregclibx_cr_image_digests) command. Untagged images have a hyphen (-) in the Tags column.\n* Do I need untagged images? If you have active containers that are running untagged images, you must retain the untagged images. If you delete untagged images that are in use, you can cause problems with scaling or automated restarts.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please let me know."}

Make sure you have the Manager role at the account level to add or remove namespaces. You can check your access roles in [Access roles for configuring Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamaccess_roles_configure).\n2. Namespaces must be unique across all IBM Cloud accounts in the same region, have 4-30 characters, start and end with a letter or number, and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. Do not put personal information in your namespace names.\n3. You can create namespaces using the IBM Cloud console or the IBM Cloud CLI. To create a namespace in the IBM Cloud console, navigate to the IBM Cloud Container Registry page and click 'Create namespace.' To create a namespace using the IBM Cloud CLI, run the command `ibmcloud cr namespace-add <namespace_name>`, replacing `<namespace_name>` with the desired unique namespace name.\n\nNamespaces allow you to divide up cluster resources and set resource quotas, default limits, and RBAC policies to control access.

For example, in the Text to Speech service, the synthesize parameter is used to specify the Text to Speech service configuration when synthesizing audio. The update\\_strategy parameter is also a message parameter and is used to specify the update strategy for the speech configuration.\n\nSimilarly, in the Speech to Text service, narrowband\\_recognize and broadband\\_recognize parameters reflect the parameters that are made available by the Speech to Text WebSocket interface.\n\nWebSocket API allows the client to continue to use the connection to send further recognition requests with new audio. By default, the service continues to use the parameters that were sent with the previous start message for all subsequent requests that are sent over the same connection. To change the parameters for subsequent requests, the client can send another start message with the new parameters after it receives the final recognition results and a new {\"state\":\"listening\"} message from the service.\n\nWebSocket API also allows the client to define the following query parameters for the phone integration's connection to the Speech to Text service, such as model, acoustic\\_customization\\_id, version, x-watson-learning-opt-out, base\\_model\\_version, and language\\_customization\\_id.\n\nIn summary, WebSocket API allows sending two types of parameters in real-time communication between a client and a server, and it allows the client to continue to use the connection to send further requests with new audio, change parameters for subsequent requests, and define specific query parameters for the phone integration's connection to the Speech to Text service."}

This typically involves creating a WebSocket object in your client-side code and calling its `open` method with the WebSocket URL of the service. The URL usually follows the format `wss://api.{location}.{service}.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id}/v1/recognize` or `wss://api.{location}.{service}.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id}/v1/synthesize`, where `{location}`, `{service}`, and `{instance_id}` are placeholders for the location of your service instance, the name of the service, and the unique identifier of the service instance, respectively.\n\nOnce the connection is established, you can send two types of parameters to the service: query parameters and message parameters. Query parameters are sent as part of the WebSocket URL when establishing the connection, and they can include parameters such as `access_token`, `model`, `acoustic_customization_id`, `version`, and `x-watson-learning-opt-out`. Message parameters, on the other hand, are sent as part of the JSON data in the request body, and they can include parameters such as `synthesize`, `update_strategy`, `narrowband_recognize`, and `broadband_recognize`.\n\nWebSocket API also allows you to continue to use the connection to send further recognition requests with new audio.

The process of configuring backup support may vary depending on the provider and your specific setup. For Watson Assistant, you can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. You can specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. If the connection to a live agent fails after transferring the call, you can configure what message to stream to callers and whether to disconnect the call or process a different dialog node. In case of a disaster recovery scenario, the phone integration supports fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider.\n\nHowever, if you decide to use third-party providers, you may need to review their documentation and contact their support for specific instructions on how to configure and integrate their services with your existing system and Watson Assistant. Keep in mind that additional costs and time may be involved in setting up and maintaining the integration of third-party services."}

These ongoing improvements aim to enhance data protection, privacy, and system resilience.\n\nIn the context of restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC, the security protocols could impact several aspects such as data encryption, access control, and network security.\n\n1. Data Encryption: With advancements in encryption techniques, the security of backup data, including snapshots, can be strengthened. For instance, if a backup snapshot is not encrypted with a customer key, the encryption of the copy remains provider-managed. However, if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-managed key, a specified key must be used to encrypt the new copy.\n\n2. Access Control: Security protocols may also influence how access to backup snapshots and restored volumes is managed. This could involve more granular control over who can create, modify, or delete backups, as well as who can restore volumes.\n\n3. Network Security: As cloud computing security protocols evolve, there may be enhancements in network security measures for backup snapshots and restored volumes. This could include features like private network connectivity for backup operations, or integration with cloud-native security tools for monitoring and threat detection.\n\nHowever, the specific implications for restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC would depend on the exact changes in the security protocols over time.

It provides logical isolation for applications, scalability, and security through subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet. You can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload, and connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance. VPC infrastructure contains a number of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, including virtual servers. Subnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway, and you can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway. Subnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary."}

Pay-As-You-Go: This is a pay-as-you-go model where you are charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. The usage is billed on a monthly consumption basis. This account type is best suited for developers and companies who prefer not to commit to a fixed subscription amount.\n\n2. Subscription: This account type requires you to buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. The usage costs are billed at a fixed rate each month, regardless of when the usage occurs within the billing period. This account type is best suited for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\n3. Enterprise Savings Plan: This is similar to a Subscription account but with additional benefits. It is best suited for both developers and enterprise organizations.

For databases, IBM provides Geo-Replicated Disaster Recovery (DR) using Db2 HADR technology. This allows you to add a DR node in an offsite data center and failover to it in the event of a disaster. However, failover is not automatic and must be initiated by the user. DR nodes are currently available for Enterprise and Standard HADR plans, and not for single node plans or EU-Cloud.\n\nFor Hyper Protect Crypto Services, disaster recovery includes the provision of disaster recovery sites, provisioning disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events. IBM is responsible for the recovery of Hyper Protect Crypto Services components, while you are responsible for the recovery of the workloads that run Hyper Protect Crypto Services and your application data.\n\nIn case of a regional disaster, you can restore your data by using failover crypto units, which automatically backs up operational crypto units and keystores in another region. Alternatively, you can use the default daily backup to restore your data by opening a support ticket and manually loading your master key to the new instance again.\n\nIt is important to note that failover crypto units must be initialized and configured the same as the operational crypto units before the disaster happens to be able to use them to restore data in a regional disaster."}

The choice of pre-annotator depends on the specific requirements of your project. For fields with unique or specialized terminology, dictionary pre-annotators can be helpful, while machine learning pre-annotators can be a better choice for documents with complex structures and context-dependent entities.\n\nRegarding combining pre-annotators, it is possible to run multiple pre-annotators on the same set of documents, but it's essential to consider that pre-annotators may produce conflicting annotations. Therefore, it's necessary to have a strategy for resolving these conflicts.\n\nAs for the tools for conversational and technical documents, Knowledge Studio supports various pre-annotation tools that cater to different document types. Generally, the Smart Document Understanding (SDU) tool is used for Document Retrieval for Contracts projects, while a pretrained SDU model is applied automatically for these projects.
