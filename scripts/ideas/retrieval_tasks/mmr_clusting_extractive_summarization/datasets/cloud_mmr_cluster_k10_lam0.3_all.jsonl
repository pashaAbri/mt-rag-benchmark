The provided documents discuss the query definition for IBM's Data Engine, which includes using SELECT statements to query input objects or tables, specifying the format of the input objects, and using various clauses and operators to refine the query.\n\nThe basic structure of a query definition in IBM's Data Engine involves using a SELECT statement after the FROM keyword to specify one or more unique resource identifiers (URIs) or input objects. Each URI can be thought of as a table, and it specifies one or more input objects or table partitions. The input objects can be in various formats, including CSV, JSON, ORC, Parquet, or AVRO. If the format is not CSV, a STORED AS clause must be used to specify the format.\n\nIf the input objects are in CSV format and a delimiter other than the default comma is used, the FIELDS TERMINATED BY option of the STORED AS clause must be used to specify the delimiter. Additionally, if the input objects are compressed with gzip or bzip2 and have the extensions .gz or .bz, they automatically get recognized as compressed files. However, it is not recommended to use these kinds of compressed files due to performance reasons.\n\nThe provided documents also discuss some query operators, including the JSON delimiter, the INCLUDES operator (:), the EXACT MATCH operator (::), the DOES NOT INCLUDE operator (:!), the NOT AN EXACT MATCH operator (::!), the ESCAPE character (\\), and the PHRASE QUERY (\"\") operators.\n\nI hope this helps!

Prepare your data first by transforming input formats, such as CSV or JSON, to a compressed format, such as Parquet.\n2. Write results into partitioned result sets. Start with a double-digit partition value. An optimal single object size is about 128 MB.\n3. Use Parquet as the output format (STORED AS clause) instead of CSV or JSON. Avoid working with Gzip objects.\n4. If you already follow the previous recommendations and still get out of memory errors, try breaking down complex statements into multiple SQL statements.\n5. When using time series functions, consult the relevant FAQ for guidance.\n\nAdditionally, if you have more than 150,000 objects in a single source location and you're not using a catalog table, it's possible that your query fails with an error. To successfully query the source location, you can:\n\n1. Create a table with the correct schema specified.\n2. If using more than 10 UNION/JOIN constructs for different source URIs, try to lower the number of different sources.\n\nFinally, the amount of data scanned depends on the amount of data that Data Engine must read to run your query, not on the actual size of your data. The data layout, object layout, and the actual query all play a role in determining how much data needs to be accessed. Each successful query is charged with at least 10 MB. So, optimizing your data layout and query structure can help improve performance and reduce costs.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}

Here are some general steps to use the API:\n\n1. Obtain your Data Engine instance's Cloud Resource Name (CRN) from the IBM Cloud console. This CRN is required for all REST API requests.\n2. Authenticate your API requests using an IAM token or an API key. You can generate an IAM token using the IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, or you can use an API key that you created for your Data Engine instance.\n3. Construct the API request by specifying the REST endpoint for your query, along with any necessary parameters and data.\n4. Send an HTTP request to the API endpoint using a tool or library of your choice. You can use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or programming languages like Python or JavaScript to send the request.\n5. Handle the API response, which will contain the query results and any relevant metadata.\n\nHere is an example of a simple API request to run a query:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}\" \\\n  --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  --data '{\n    \"query\": \"SELECT * FROM my_table\",\n    \"parameters\": [],\n    \"max_rows\": 100,\n    \"into\": \"my_bucket/result.csv\"\n  }' \\\n  \"https://data-engine-service-crn.databases.appdomain.cloud/v3/sql_queries\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `curl` command sends an HTTP POST request to the Data Engine REST API endpoint for running SQL queries. The request includes an IAM token for authentication, a JSON payload with the query and other parameters, and a URL with the CRN for the Data Engine instance.\n\nThe JSON payload includes the query itself, an empty list of parameters, a limit of 100 rows for the query result, and a target location for storing the result in a Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket.\n\nThe response to this API request will include the query result and any relevant metadata, such as the number of rows and the elapsed time."}

It allows you to create custom indexes using a supplied JavaScript function and perform flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields.\n\nHere are some steps to use IBM Cloudant Query:\n\n1. Create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data.\n2. Create secondary indexes using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard or APIs to help service your query access patterns. This is important because query performance can degrade as your data volume grows without proper indexing.\n3. Use the `_find` API to query your database using IBM Cloudant Query. The `_find` API allows you to perform simple or complex queries using a JSON query string.\n\nHere is an example query that searches for documents with a \"title\" field that contains the word \"gatsby\" and an \"author\" field that starts with the word \"fitz\":\n```bash\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME?include_docs=true&query=\"title:gatsby AND author:fitz*\"\n```\nIn this example, `$DATABASE` is the name of your database, `$DDOC` is the name of the design document that contains the index, and `$INDEX_NAME` is the name of the index.\n\nKeep in mind that IBM Cloudant Query is not the only querying mechanism available in IBM Cloudant. You can also use the `_all_docs` endpoint for simple queries, or the `_list` and `_view` endpoints for more complex queries.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}

The WebSocket API sends two types of parameters: query parameters and message parameters.\n\nQuery parameters are sent when the phone integration connects to the service. These parameters include the voice, rate, and other settings for the Text to Speech service.\n\nMessage parameters, on the other hand, are sent as part of the JSON data in the request body. They allow you to specify the text that you want to convert to speech, as well as other settings such as the timing, intonation, and emphasis of the speech.\n\nFor more detailed information about the specific parameters that are available, you can refer to the Text to Speech API documentation at <https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/text-to-speech>.\n\nIn addition, it's important to note that the WebSocket API can return different response codes depending on the implementation.

You can do this by calling the /v1/synthesize method, which is available at a specific endpoint that includes your application's location and instance ID.\n\nOnce you have established a connection, you can send text and binary messages over the connection to initiate and manage recognition requests. The WebSocket API uses query parameters to authenticate with the service, and message parameters to specify the audio format and any additional parameters for the request.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the WebSocket API to send a recognition request:\n\nvar access\\_token = {access\\_token};\nvar wsURI = '{ws\\_url}/v1/recognize'\n+ '?access\\_token=' + access\\_token;\nvar websocket = new WebSocket(wsURI);\n\nwebsocket.onopen = function(evt) {\nvar message = {\naction: 'start',\ncontent-type: 'audio/flac'\n};\nwebsocket.send(JSON.stringify(message));\nwebsocket.send(blob);\nwebsocket.send(JSON.stringify({action: 'stop'}));\n}\n\nIn this example, we first define the access token and WebSocket URI, and then create a new WebSocket object. We then define an event handler for the WebSocket.onopen event, which is triggered when the connection is established. In this event handler, we send a JSON message to initiate the recognition request, followed by the binary audio data, and then a final JSON message to stop the recognition request.\n\nNote that this is just a basic example, and you will need to define additional event handlers to handle the response from the service, and to manage errors and other scenarios.\n\nFor more detailed information about the WebSocket API and its parameters, you can refer to the API & SDK reference at <https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/text-to-speech>."}

You can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. This can be done by specifying a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues on the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings. Additionally, you can define a call failure message and a transfer failure message.\n\nHowever, the document does not directly address the use of third-party providers in case of call and transfer failures. In general, if you are experiencing call and transfer failures, you may want to consider working with a reliable SIP trunking provider that can offer redundancy and disaster recovery options. This can help ensure that your phone integration remains operational even in the event of service outages or other issues.\n\nWhen working with third-party providers, it is important to make sure that the provider's service is compatible with the Watson Assistant phone integration and that any necessary configuration changes are made on both ends to ensure seamless operation. You may also want to consider implementing a failover strategy that can automatically switch to a backup provider in case of failures.\n\nIn summary, while the IBM Cloud documentation provides information on how to handle call and transfer failures within the Watson Assistant phone integration, working with a reliable SIP trunking provider and implementing a failover strategy can help ensure seamless operation and minimize downtime in case of failures."}

However, when you provision an instance by restoring a boot volume from a bootable backup snapshot, you can expect degraded performance in the beginning due to the data being copied from IBM Cloud Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC.\n\nThere are also options for fast restore and cross-regional backup copies. Fast restore allows for nearly immediate volume restoration and full IOPS instantly by caching snapshots in a specified zone. Cross-regional backup copies can be used in disaster recovery scenarios, allowing you to restore a volume in a different region using a copied backup snapshot. \n\nIn terms of security, if the source snapshot is not encrypted with a customer key, the encryption of the copy remains provider-managed. If the source snapshot is protected by a customer-managed key, you must specify the customer-managed key that you want to use to encrypt the new copy. Only one copy of the backup snapshot can exist in each region.\n\nAs for the potential implications of these processes on security, it's important to note that as cloud computing security protocols evolve, so too might the security measures involved in these volume restoration processes. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it would be best to refer to the latest documentation provided by IBM Cloud."}

Pay-As-You-Go: This account type does not require a subscription commitment and you are billed for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes.\n\n2. Subscription: This account type requires a subscription commitment for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. You are billed a fixed amount each month, regardless of when you incur usage costs within that year.\n\n3. Enterprise Savings Plan (billing model): This is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. This billing model is best suited for both developers and enterprise organizations.\n\nAdditionally, the IBM Cloud billable account charges you for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes using the following charging types:\n\n- Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n- Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n- Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

However, it seems like you're asking about the differences among Fixed, Metered, Tiered, and Reserved pricing models themselves, not just the terms. Is that correct? User: Yes, that's correct. Then to answer your question, the key difference between Fixed, Metered, Tiered, and Reserved pricing models is how they calculate costs: - Fixed pricing charges a steady rate that doesn't change based on usage. - Metered pricing charges based on the amount of a resource that you use.", "agent_response": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the difference between Fixed, Metered, Tiered, and Reserved charges on IBM Cloud:\n\n1. Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted, regardless of how much or how little you use the service. For example, if you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period.\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. This means you pay for what you use, and the cost will vary depending on how much of the service you consume. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Similar to metered charges, tiered charges are based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. This pricing model is typically offered for services where you can reserve a service instance for a discounted price for a certain period of time. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n\nIt's important to note that different fees, discounts, and taxes may apply depending on the type of charge, and the pricing can vary by region.

For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. The child nodes then provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n\n2. The second type is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value and defines a set of slots. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user, looking for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable. This type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, the document mentions the Connect to human agent response type, which is used to transfer the conversation to a human agent at a specified point in the dialog."}

{"_id": "f5a8ca2f2bc12180940167fb920bb018<::>7", "text": "|user|: Which type can I create?", "agent_response": "Based on the provided document, there are two main types of dialog nodes that you can create:\n\n1. The first type conditions on an intent value. It is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then, in the root response, ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. The child nodes then provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n\n2. The second type is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value and defines a set of slots. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user, looking for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable. This type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\nAdditionally, there is the Connect to human agent response type, which is used to transfer the conversation to a human agent at a specified point in the dialog."}

Skills can help you customize your assistant to better satisfy your customers' goals. Conversational skills return responses that are authored by you to answer common questions, while a search skill searches for and returns passages from existing self-service content. By adding conversational skills, you can understand and address questions or requests that your customers typically ask about. An actions skill offers a simple interface for building a conversational flow, while a dialog skill allows you to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree, with the dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize. A search skill can give your assistant access to existing content in your organization's technical information collateral, allowing it to return smart answers to natural language questions. Expanding your assistant's responsibilities and leveraging existing content can help you understand what your customers are asking about and how well your assistant is able to meet their needs."}

If you see the error message \"The service was not able to delete key '<key\\_name>'. The key cannot be deleted because it is protecting one or more cloud resources that have a retention policy,\" it means that the key you are trying to delete is actively protecting one or more cloud resources, such as a Cloud Object Storage bucket. To resolve this issue, you should review the resources associated with the key before deleting it. You can force deletion on a key that's protecting a cloud resource, but the action won't succeed if the key's associated resource is nonerasable due to a retention policy.\n2. If you see the error message \"The service was not able to delete key '<key\\_name>'. Because the key is enabled with the dual authorization policy and you set the key for deletion, a second approver needs to continue with the key deletion operation,\" it means that the key is enabled with the dual authorization policy that requires a deletion authorization from two users. You have set the key for deletion, but you need to contact the second approver to complete the deletion.\n\nTo see how many versions you have of each key, you can log in to the IBM Cloud console, go to the resource list, select your provisioned instance of Key Protect, and open the Key details panel for each key to view the number of versions.\n\nWhen you destroy a managed key in Unified Key Orchestrator, it cannot be restored, but you can still restore your keys in external keystores depending on the settings of the cloud providers. For more information, you can refer to the Azure Key Vault soft-delete overview, Deleting AWS KMS keys, or Deleting and purging keys in Key Protect."}

However, if the key is protecting a registered IBM Cloud resource that's non-erasable due to a retention policy, the force deletion will not succeed. Additionally, any data encrypted by the key will become inaccessible, and 30 days after the key is deleted, it can no longer be restored. The key material will be destroyed after 90 days. It's important to verify whether a key is associated with a non-erasable resource by checking the 'preventKeyDeletion' field in the registration details for the key before forcing deletion."}

This is called Bring your own key for backups (BYOK for backups), and it is available only in US regions us-south and us-east, and eu-de. Only keys in the us-south and eu-de are durable to region failures. To ensure that your backups are available even if a region failure occurs, you must use a key from us-south or eu-de, regardless of your deployment's location.\n\nWhen a service instance is deleted, the database that it provides is also removed. This will delete any online data and logs as well as database backups. The data will not be recoverable after this action. All data is encrypted at rest to ensure data is protected at all times using encryption keys stored in a key management service called Key Protect. When access to those keys is removed, the data is crypto-shredded and cannot be recovered. When the service instance is deleted, the block storage that is used for the database is wiped to ensure that all of the data is erased. Any data objects in cloud object storage are also deleted and not recoverable.\n\nIf you want to remove a specific safeset from your vault, you cannot do it yourself. You need to create a support case so that the IBM Cloud Backup Admins can erase it on the backend.

Optionally, you can customize the style of the chat window, such as the public assistant name, primary color, secondary color, and accent color.\n2. Copy the generated HTML script element. Once you've created a web chat instance, a script element will be generated. You can copy this script element.\n3. Embed the script element in your HTML source. You can then paste this script element into any page or pages on your website where you want users to be able to ask your assistant for help.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the document on \"Integrating the web chat with your website.\"\n\nOnce you've added the web chat widget to your website, you can customize it further by using the web chat API and configuration object. You can also configure the overall appearance of the web chat widget, such as the assistant name, colors, avatar image, and Built with IBM Watson watermark, on the Style tab.\n\nNote that if you're embedding the web chat in a mobile app, you can use a WebView to do so. The web chat API consists of several components, including a configuration object, instance methods, and events. You can use these components to customize and extend the web chat widget."}

These JWTs are digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, ensuring that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data. However, you should ensure that you follow the steps for enabling web chat security, including implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key, customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT, and enabling security in the web chat security settings. After you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected. For more information, you can refer to the document on \"Enabling web chat security\"."}
