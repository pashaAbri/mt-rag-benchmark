This command allows you to filter logs based on various parameters such as cluster, type, namespace, container, level, and message.\n\nFor example:\n\n* ibmcloud ks logging filter create --cluster example-cluster --type container --namespace default --container test-container --level debug --message \"GET request\"\n\nThis command filters out all logs that are forwarded from containers with the name test-container in the default namespace that are at the debug level or less, and have a log message that contains \"GET request\".\n\n* ibmcloud ks logging filter create --cluster example-cluster --type all --level info --output json\n\nThis command filters out all the logs that are forwarded, at an info level or less, from a specific cluster. The output is returned as JSON.\n\nAdditionally, the document provides filters for viewing individual messages in a conversation with an assistant. For any user input entry, clicking \"Open conversation\" allows you to see the user input and the response made to it by the assistant within the context of the full conversation. The time shown for each conversation is localized to reflect the time zone of your browser. If the spell check feature is enabled for the skill, any user utterances that were corrected are highlighted by the Auto-correct icon, and you can hover over the underlined term to see the user's original input.\n\nThe document also mentions that creating a dialog skill is an iterative process, and while developing your skill, you can use the Try it out pane to verify that your assistant recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and make corrections as needed.

When you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect any security issues. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability. Any issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. Fixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe specific functions available in Vulnerability Advisor version 3 include scanning images for issues, providing an evaluation report based on security practices that are specific to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, providing recommendations to secure configuration files for a subset of application types, providing instructions about how to fix a reported vulnerable package or configuration issue in its reports, and applying exemption policies to reports at an account, namespace, repository, or tag level to mark when issues that are flagged do not apply to your use case.\n\nNote that Vulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023, and users are encouraged to update to version 4.

The IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry is a managed service provided by IBM that allows you to store and manage container images in a private registry. It is multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted, providing a secure environment for your container images. The registry uses private namespaces to segment data, which are strictly owned by single accounts and can be controlled using Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies. The IBM Cloud Container Registry runs in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service clusters and uses IBM Cloud Object Storage to store image data, which is encrypted at rest. The service is available in multiple regions, including a global registry (icr.io) and a new region in Toronto, Canada (ca-tor.icr.io), with each region having physically separate data centers for high availability and data retention."}
{"_id": "c6c3b02ca32795af64c903dd76700517<::>8", "text": "|user|: How do I grant access to the IBM Cloud Container Registry?", "agent_response": "To grant access to resources in IBM Cloud Container Registry, you can configure IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for the registry. All accounts require IAM access policies, which can be set up and managed using the instructions in the Defining IAM access policies document. For more information about managing access to your resources using IAM, see the Managing access to resources document.\n\nBefore granting access to the registry, you should complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Complete the instructions in Getting started with IBM Cloud Container Registry.\n2. Ensure that you have the most recent version of the container-registry CLI plug-in for the IBM Cloud CLI.\n3. Ensure that you have access to two IBM Cloud accounts, one for User A and one for User B, each with a unique email address. You will work in your own account, User A, and invite User B to use your account.\n4. Ensure that you have the correct access permissions for adding and removing namespaces in the registry.\n\nAfter completing these tasks, you can follow the Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial to authorize User B to configure the registry.\n\nIt's important to note that users can be members of many accounts, but you can't give access outside the account, that is, you can't share a namespace to multiple accounts. If you want to share an image with many users, you can create an IBM Cloud account and invite them all to it. They can then all have access to any namespace created in the account. You can create a subset of the users and set an IAM access policy to differentiate access at the namespace level.\n\nFor more information about defining IAM access policies, see Defining IAM access policies."}

Choose a unique namespace name that meets the requirements specified in the IBM Cloud documentation. Your namespace must be unique across all IBM Cloud accounts in the same region, have 4-30 characters, start and end with a letter or number, and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.\n2. Set up multiple namespaces if you have multiple teams and projects that share the cluster, or if you want to have separate repositories for your production and staging environments. Note that namespace names are unique within regions, and you can have up to 100 namespaces in each region.\n3. Set up proper RBAC policies to control access to namespaces.\n\nIf you need more information, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation on Assigning existing namespaces to resource groups. It contains a detailed guide on how to set up namespaces and manage access to them.\n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask."}

The service automatically closes the WebSocket connection when it finishes processing the request.\n\nThe process of using the WebSocket API for text-to-speech synthesis involves the following steps:\n\n1. Open a connection: This involves calling the /v1/synthesize method of the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service to establish a connection.\n2. Send input text: Once the connection is established, you can send the text to be synthesized as a JSON text message over the connection.\n3. Receive a response: After the service finishes processing the request, it will return a response over the WebSocket connection.\n\nThe WebSocket interface of the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service accepts identical input and produces identical results as the GET and POST /v1/synthesize methods of the HTTP interface. However, the WebSocket interface has some additional features, such as the ability to use the SSML <mark> element to identify the location of user-specified markers in the audio, and the ability to return timing information for all strings of the input text.\n\nThe WebSocket interface is based on the HTML5 WebSocket API. For more information about WebSocket return codes, you can refer to the IETF RFC 6455. Additionally, the WebSocket implementations of the SDKs can return different or additional response codes, so you may want to refer to the API & SDK reference on the IBM Cloud website.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about using the WebSocket API for text-to-speech synthesis, please let me know!"}

Open a connection: You can call the `/v1/synthesize` method of the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service over the WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol to establish a connection. The method is available at the endpoint `wss://api.{location}.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance_id}/v1/synthesize`, where `{location}` indicates where your application is hosted and `{instance_id}` is the unique identifier of the service instance. The documentation abbreviates the endpoint as `{ws_url}/v1/synthesize`. To open a connection, you can create a WebSocket object and set the `onopen` event handler to send a JSON message to the service to start the text-to-speech synthesis process.\n2. Send input text: Once the connection is established, you can send the text to be synthesized as a JSON text message over the connection. The message should include the `action` property set to `'start'` and the `content-type` property set to the desired audio format, such as `'audio/flac'`. You can then send the text to be synthesized as a binary message (blob) over the connection. To end the synthesis process, you can send another JSON message with the `action` property set to `'stop'`.\n3. Receive a response: After the service finishes processing the request, it will return a response over the WebSocket connection. The response will include the synthesized audio in the requested format. You can register an event handler for the `onmessage` event of the WebSocket object to receive the response and process the synthesized audio.\n\nThe WebSocket interface of the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service accepts identical input and produces identical results as the GET and POST `/v1/synthesize` methods of the HTTP interface. However, the WebSocket interface also supports the use of the SSML `<mark>` element to identify the location of user-specified markers in the audio, and it can return timing information for all strings of the input text.

In this case, you can configure the phone integration to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. This way, the call can be redirected to another zone or region. To do this, you need to request IBM to enable this 500 error response capability for your specific Watson Assistant instance. It's crucial to plan for both full and partial service outages and set up a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This includes having a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. Automation should first handle complete regional outages and then implement strategies for partial outages.\n\nFor web chat, you can use the onError listening feature to detect specific types of outage errors, such as INITIAL\\_CONFIG, OPEN\\_CONFIG, and MESSAGE\\_COMMUNICATION errors. Handling a failover for web chat is simple if you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region.

VPCs can be deployed in a single region and span multiple zones within that region.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway, and you can assign floating IP addresses to virtual server instances to enable them to be reachable from the internet. Subnets within the VPC offer private connectivity and can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router, without setting up routes.\n\nRegions represent the geographic area in which a VPC is deployed and contain multiple zones, while zones are abstractions that refer to the physical data center hosting compute, network, and storage resources, with related cooling and power. Zones are isolated from each other for fault tolerance, reduced latency, and a default address prefix specifying the address range for subnet creation.\n\nVPCs can encapsulate corporate divisions or collections of microservices owned by a DevSecOps team and can be connected to on-premises enterprises and other VPCs, potentially requiring traffic routing through centralized firewall-gateway appliances.\n\nThe documents also mention some updates, like the expansion of file storage general purpose 3 IOPS/GB profile, the introduction of placement groups (Beta), UI enhancements, and Application Load Balancer (ALB) support for cookie-based session persistence.\n\nFor specific information on how cloud computing security protocols evolve over time and their implications for restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC, I recommend checking the official IBM Cloud VPC documentation or contacting IBM support directly."}

For example, if you purchase an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period.\n2. **Metered**: Metered charges are usage-based pricing models in which you pay for what you consume. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged on a per-usage basis.\n3. **Tiered**: Tiered charges are similar to metered charges, but they offer discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is often offered in simple, graduated, or block models.\n4. **Reserved**: Reserved charges are based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services such as Db2 on Cloud offer reserved plans.\n\nIt's important to note that these charging models can apply to different types of resources and services on IBM Cloud."}

Because the key is enabled with the dual authorization policy and you set the key for deletion, a second approver needs to continue with the key deletion operation.\" This means that the key is enabled with a dual authorization policy that requires deletion authorization from two users. In this case, you have set the key for deletion and need to contact the second approver to complete the deletion.\n\nLastly, if you are unable to authenticate while making a request, this might be due to not having the correct authorization to perform Hyper Protect Crypto Services actions in the specified service instance. You should verify with an administrator that you are assigned the correct platform and service access roles in the applicable service instance and that you are using a valid token associated with an account that is authorized to perform the service action.\n\nIf you are unable to view or list keys in a service instance, you can call the GET api/v2/keys to list the keys available in your service instance.

This includes having a disaster recovery plan, which involves knowing, preserving, and being prepared to restore all data that is maintained on IBM Cloud. IBM Cloud provides tools and procedures for copying and storing essential data in a secure location and for recovering that data to restore normalcy of operation. You are responsible for your data backup and associated recovery of your content. IBM Cloud has business continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of services within hours if a disaster occurs, but each business application has its own recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) requirements, which need to be reviewed, documented, and implemented before going to production. There are different options to implement DR solutions, such as Active/Passive and Active/Standby, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific RTO and RPO requirements.\n\nIn the case of Hyper Protect Crypto Services, a 7-day waiting period is set on the key when the first user authorizes a key for deletion, during which the key remains in the Active state and all key operations are allowed. To complete the deletion, the second user with a Manager access policy can use the IBM Cloud console or API to delete the key. After the key is deleted, it can be restored within 30 days, and associated data such as key metadata, registrations, and policies can be retrieved for up to 90 days. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged and its associated data will be permanently removed.\n\nRegarding backups, if you use Key Protect, you can designate a key to encrypt the Cloud Object Storage disk that holds your deployment's backups.

Check the bottom right corner of the webpage, as this is the default position for the web chat launcher.\n2. Look for a small circular icon in the bottom right corner, often with a chat bubble or a similar icon.\n3. If you don't see the launcher, try scrolling up or down the page, as the launcher might be anchored to the bottom of the window and may not be visible when you're at the very top or bottom of the page.\n4. If you still cannot locate the web chat, check the website's layout and navigation to see if there's a separate web chat page or a dedicated button to open the web chat.\n5.

Here are the steps to enable web chat security:\n\n1. Generate a JWT signed with your private key.\n2. Customize the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT.\n3. Enable security in the web chat settings.\n\nAfter enabling web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected. For more information, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).\n\nKeep in mind that anyone who has the IDs could use them to send messages to your assistant and receive its replies. However, these IDs cannot be used to log in to your account, make any changes to your assistant, or retrieve logs or analytics information about your assistant. If you are concerned about unauthorized access to your assistant, consider enabling the web chat security feature for additional security, such as verifying message origin and authenticating users.

The web chat widget from IBM Watson Assistant is a code snippet that you can embed in your website. It allows users to start conversations with common questions or tasks, display multimedia and interactive elements, and transfer to human agents for further assistance. The web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. It supports a variety of devices and platforms, and is designed to be accessible and inclusive.\n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, you can create a web chat instance for your assistant in the Watson Assistant interface, customize the style of the chat window, and then embed the generated code in your website. For further customization and extension, you can use the web chat API if you are comfortable with JavaScript code.\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure that messages originate from your website and to securely authenticate users. You can also encrypt sensitive data in the JWT payload. To enable web chat security, you need to generate a JWT signed with your private key, customize the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT, and enable security in the web chat settings. After enabling web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\nFor more detailed information about the web chat API, you can refer to the web chat developer documentation at <https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=>."}
