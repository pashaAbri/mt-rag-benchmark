This can help improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and returned.\n\n2. **Using indexes**: Indexes can help improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate and retrieve the data that you're looking for. In the Cloudant documentation provided, it's recommended to use the `explain` feature to see which index is being selected for each query and to create meaningful indexes on fixed attributes.\n\n3. **Reducing the complexity of your query**: Queries with a lot of aggregations, operators, or counts can be more complex and take longer to process. If possible, try to simplify your query by reducing the number of aggregations, operators, or counts.\n\n4. **Limiting the fields returned**: Only retrieving the fields that you need can help improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and returned.\n\n5. **Using features like passage retrieval and relevancy training judiciously**: These features can enhance query results, but they can also impact performance. Make sure you're only using them when necessary and that you're adjusting parameters like `passages.fields` and the number of top-level fields to minimize their impact on performance.\n\n6. **Using the filter parameter for simple queries**: If you're running a simple query, especially on a small data set, using the filter parameter can be faster than using the query parameter, as it excludes any documents that don't mention the query content without returning results in order of relevance.\n\nIf you provide more specific details about your query, I may be able to offer more tailored advice."}

The API reference for the Query API can be found in the IBM Cloud documentation.\n\nThe Query API supports the 'passages' parameter, which can be used to return a set of the most relevant passages from the documents in your collection. This feature is supported only on private collections and not in the Watson Discovery News collection. The passages parameter currently returns a maximum of three (3) passages from any given document in the collection.\n\nAdditionally, the Query API also supports the 'sort' parameter, which enables you to specify a comma-separated list of fields in the document to sort on. This feature can help you to sort and retrieve data based on specific fields and values.\n\nIt's important to note that specifying the passages parameter can reduce performance as a result of increased processing to extract passages. With larger environments, the performance impact can be lessened. Additionally, the passages parameter returns a maximum of 10 results, and the number of returned results cannot be changed.\n\nIf you need more information or have further questions about the Query API, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation and the IBM Cloud SQL Query blog for more information on using Data Engine and running queries."}

IBM Cloudant Query is a powerful feature of IBM Cloudant that allows you to query your data using a flexible query language based on Apache Lucene. Here are some steps to get started with IBM Cloudant Query:\n\n1. Define an index: Before you can query your data using IBM Cloudant Query, you need to define an index. An index is a data structure that is optimized for fast search and retrieval of data. You can define an index using a design document, which is a JSON document that contains the index definition. The index definition specifies the fields that you want to index and the parameters for each field.\n2. Query the data: Once you have defined an index, you can query the data using the _find endpoint. The query language is based on Apache Lucene, and it allows you to search for data using various operators and functions. You can search for data based on exact matches, regular expressions, ranges, and more.\n3. Retrieve the results: When you query the data using IBM Cloudant Query, you can retrieve the results in various formats, including JSON, XML, and CSV. You can also specify the number of documents to return, the sort order, and other parameters.\n\nHere's an example of how to use IBM Cloudant Query to search for documents by author and year:\n\nGET /{database}/_design/{ddoc}/_search/{index}?q=\"author:Dickens AND year:1840\"\n\nIn this example, {database} is the name of the database that contains the documents, {ddoc} is the name of the design document that contains the index definition, and {index} is the name of the index. The q parameter specifies the query, which searches for documents where the author is Dickens and the year is 1840.\n\nKeep in mind that IBM Cloudant Query is just one of the many features of IBM Cloudant, and there are many other ways to interact with your data using the IBM Cloudant API.

Query parameters are sent when phone integration connects to the service, while message parameters are sent as part of the JSON data in the request body. The WebSocket API can be used to change the voice of the assistant, enable or disable speech barge-in, and transfer a call to a live agent. When the socket closes with an error, the client receives an informative message of the form {\"error\":\"{message}\"} before the socket closes.\n\nFor more information about the WebSocket API, you can refer to the Text to Speech API documentation provided in the documents. Additionally, you can consult the WebSocket return codes information in IETF RFC 6455 and the API & SDK reference for more information about the WebSocket implementations of the SDKs."}

You can specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. Additionally, you can configure a call failure message and a transfer failure message that the assistant will say to a caller if the call transfer to a live agent fails. If you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\nIf you need to use third-party providers for handling call and transfer failures, you can consider using a SIP trunking provider that can support disaster recovery by configuring two separate SIP trunks, one for each region. The SIP INVITE failure timeouts should be set low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\nFor handling partial service outages within the region, Watson Assistant can be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. This can redirect the call to another zone or region. However, to enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nIt's important to plan for both full and partial service outages and start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment."}

However, they do provide information on restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC.\n\nWhen restoring a volume from a backup snapshot, the restored volume has the same capacity and IOPS tier profile as the original volume. If the backup is of a boot volume, you can use it to provision a new instance. However, when you provision an instance by restoring a boot volume from a bootable backup snapshot, you can expect degraded performance in the beginning due to the data being copied from IBM Cloud Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC.\n\nThe fast restore feature can be used to cache snapshots in a specified zone of your choosing, allowing volumes to be restored from snapshots nearly immediately and the new volumes to operate with full IOPS instantly.\n\nCross-regional copy is also possible, where you can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another and later use that snapshot to restore a volume in the new region. This can be useful in disaster recovery scenarios.\n\nIt's important to note that the encryption of the copy remains provider-managed if the source snapshot is not encrypted with a customer key. If the source snapshot is protected by a customer-managed key, you must specify the customer-managed key that you want to use to encrypt the new copy.\n\nIn terms of security implications, it's crucial to manage and use backup snapshots carefully, ensuring that they are encrypted and that access to them is controlled and monitored to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation. As cloud computing security protocols evolve, these practices may need to be adjusted to align with new standards, threats, and best practices."}

IBM Cloud VPC provides a virtual network that is linked to your customer account, giving you cloud security with the ability to scale dynamically. It provides fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation. Each VPC is deployed to a single region and can span multiple zones within that region. Subnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway, and you can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet. Subnets within the VPC offer private connectivity and can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router without setting up routes.\n\nIn addition, VPCs can encapsulate a corporate division or a collection of microservices owned by a DevSecOps team, and they can be connected to an on-premises enterprise and each other, potentially requiring routing traffic through centralized firewall-gateway appliances.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any specific questions about VPC, please let me know."}

Public clouds: Public clouds are operated by third-party service providers, such as IBM Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. These clouds offer their resources, such as storage and computing power, over the internet to the public. Users typically pay for these resources on a usage-based model.\n\n2. Private clouds: Private clouds are operated by individual organizations for their own use. They can be physically located on the organization's premises or operated by a third-party service provider. Private clouds offer greater control over data and resources but require more resources to maintain and manage.\n\n3. Hybrid clouds: Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds. They allow organizations to use public clouds for certain workloads, such as testing and development, while keeping sensitive data and applications on a private cloud. Hybrid clouds offer the benefits of both public and private clouds, such as scalability and cost savings, while maintaining control over critical data and applications.\n\nI hope this helps!

Pay-As-You-Go: This account type does not require a subscription commitment and you are billed for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes.\n\n2. Subscription: This account type requires a subscription commitment for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. You are billed a fixed amount each month, regardless of your usage.\n\n3. Enterprise Savings Plan: This billing model is similar to a Subscription account but is best suited for enterprise organizations. It offers a discount on your usage costs, and you are billed a fixed amount each month, regardless of your usage.\n\nThe main difference between these account types is the subscription commitment and the billing model. The Subscription account and Enterprise Savings Plan offer a discount on usage costs in exchange for a spending commitment, while the Pay-As-You-Go account does not have a subscription commitment and you are billed for the actual usage.

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n3. Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans.\n\nAdditionally, there are different billing models that can affect how and when you are charged. For example, Subscription accounts have a fixed billing amount each month, while Pay-As-You-Go accounts are billed for actual usage."}

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted. It does not matter how much or how little you use the service, the charge remains the same. An example of this is the Bare Metal Servers, which are charged at a flat-rate.\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. You pay for what you consume, so if you use more or less of the service, your charge will increase or decrease accordingly. An example of this is the Push service, where any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block. It is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. An example of this is the API Connect service, which charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service and selecting the service plan that best meets your needs.\n\nI hope that helps!

You can also leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect malicious attacks and suspicious usage patterns.\n\nIn terms of access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies you assign users vary depending on what you want your users to be able to do. Some examples of roles you might assign to meet different use cases are:\n\n1. Cluster Administrator: This role has full access to the cluster and can perform all actions.\n2. Operator: This role can manage and deploy applications, but cannot modify cluster-level settings.\n3. Viewer: This role can view resources and logs, but cannot make changes.\n\nTo assign policies, you can use the IBM Cloud IAM platform or the Kubernetes RBAC API. For more information about types of access policies and steps to assign policies, see [Security for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-securitysecurity) and [Granting users access to your cluster through IBM Cloud IAM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-userschecking-perms)."}

Specifically, the provisioned throughput capacity is fixed at 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second, and data storage is capped at 1 GB.\n\nThe Standard plan, on the other hand, is a paid plan that includes 20 GB of data storage for free. Any additional data stored beyond the 20 GB is metered for billing. This plan also offers the ability to scale provisioned throughput capacity.\n\nAdditionally, with the Lite plan, if you exceed the 1 GB storage limit, you will receive a warning and won't be able to write new data. To write new data, you will either need to upgrade to the Standard plan or delete data to fall under the 1 GB limit and wait until the next daily storage check. With the Standard plan, if you use more than the 20 GB of storage included, you will be billed for the excess storage on an hourly basis.\n\nYou are limited to one IBM Cloudant Lite plan instance per IBM Cloud account. If you already have a Lite plan instance, you cannot create a second Lite plan instance or change a Standard plan instance to a Lite plan."}

IBM Cloud has business continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of services within hours if a disaster occurs. However, customers are responsible for their data backup and associated recovery of their content. IBM Cloud performs regular electronic backups of project data with Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of hours as documented in the IBM Cloud Disaster Recovery Plan. Projects don't replicate data outside of a region, except for backup data. When possible, backup data is kept within the data centers of a country but data is always kept within a geography. European data does not leave the EU. For more information about your responsibilities when using projects, see Shared responsibilities for projects.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure as code, it ensures that good backup practices are implemented in a uniform way across the organization. Implementation of backups should be included as part of deployable architectures, with backup configuration kept close to provisioning code to ensure easier adjustment as information system changes occur. Backup accounts should be created and configured as code, with each BU account group including a separate backup account and an additional backup account used for centralized accounts. If you are using Cloud Object Storage for backup, at minimum, use separate buckets for backing up different workload accounts and use separate backup credentials for each bucket where service to service policies are not possible. Use Cloud Object Storage versioning or immutable buckets for maximum security. Services that provide built-in backup facilities might have limitations regarding backup accounts. IBM Cloud Databases provide automatic daily backups that are stored in the same account and geography, typically in cross-regional storage, and should therefore be immune to a single region outage."}

You can use one pre-annotator at a time or combine them depending on your specific needs. For example, you can use a dictionary pre-annotator to identify terms and a machine learning model to automatically annotate documents based on patterns and common tokens.\n\nRegarding the tools for conversational and technical documents, Knowledge Studio supports pre-annotation for both types of documents. However, the Smart Document Understanding (SDU) tool is more commonly used for technical documents, as it can extract text from images in the files that it analyzes and is optimized for recognizing terms and concepts that are significant to technical documents.\n\nWhen using multiple pre-annotators, the first annotation made to a span of text is saved for the results. Therefore, it's essential to configure the order of pre-annotators carefully. The SDU tool can extract text from images and PDFs but cannot read documents with certain characteristics, such as overlapping text or multiple columns of text on a single page.\n\nHuman annotators can specify entity subtypes for each pre-annotated mention by working on an annotation task with the pre-annotated document. Alternatively, you can upload already-annotated documents and use them to start training the machine learning model. However, you cannot run a pre-annotator on annotated documents that you upload, or the existing annotations will be stripped from the documents and replaced with annotations produced by the pre-annotator only.\n\nPre-annotation is applied to individual documents without regard for the various document sets that a document might belong to. Therefore, a document that overlaps between a selected document set and an unselected document set will be pre-annotated in both document sets.\n\nPre-annotating documents with a dictionary can help human annotators get started with their annotation tasks. When a human annotator begins work on documents that were pre-annotated, it is likely that a number of mentions will already be marked by entity types based on the dictionary entries.\n\nRegarding your question about the Score Agreement level and the number of annotators needed, the guidelines provided in the document do not specify an exact number of annotators required.

To enable web chat security, you need to implement server code that generates a JWT signed with your private key, customize the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT, and enable security in the web chat security settings. Any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected. For more information, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).\n\nWhen passing sensitive data through the web chat, you can use the public key provided by IBM to add an additional level of encryption. This method should only be used after enabling the web chat security feature. The encrypted sensitive information will be stored in a private context variable, which cannot be seen by customers and is never sent back to the web chat. For more information, see [Encrypting sensitive data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-securityweb-chat-security-encrypt).\n\nAdditionally, you can configure the web chat to pass user information, such as name and email address, in the payload using the following syntax:\n\n```json\n{\n  user_payload : {\n    name: '{customerName}',\n    email: '{customerEmail}'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nZendesk also expects iat and external_id name and value pairs, but IBM automatically provides these values in a JWT. For an example of how to implement this in NodeJS, see the provided document."}

The web chat launcher's appearance and behavior can be configured, and you can choose to display a pre-chat or post-chat form.\n\nTo customize the launcher's appearance and behavior, you can refer to the documentation on [Configuring the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-config). By default, the launcher appears as a small circle in the bottom right corner and expands after 15 seconds to show a greeting message. For desktop browsers, the expanded launcher shows two primary buttons and a Close button, while for mobile browsers, it shows only a single primary button.\n\nIf you want to gather information from your customers before starting a chat session, you can display a pre-chat form before opening the web chat. Similarly, you might want to display a form after the web chat closes (for example, a customer satisfaction survey). You can use the same approach for either situation by subscribing to the appropriate event (window:open or window:pre:close) and using custom panels to open a panel with custom content. By returning a promise that is resolved when the custom panel closes, you can pause the process of opening or closing the web chat until after the customer completes the form.\n\nFor a complete, working version of the example described in this tutorial, you can refer to [Pre and post-chat forms for Watson Assistant web chat](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/webchat/examples/pre-post-chat-forms)."}

This can be done during the initialization of the web chat or by using the `setContext` method to update the user identity information during the conversation. It is recommended to use a non-human-identifiable ID that doesn't change throughout the customer lifecycle, and not to use a person's email address as the user ID. The user_id syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230section-3.2)."}

It provides a launcher icon that users can click to open the chat window and start a conversation with the assistant. The assistant can help users with common questions or tasks, display multimedia and interactive elements, and transfer users to human agents for more help. The appearance and behavior of the launcher icon and chat window can be customized to match your branding. The web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant and can be customized using JavaScript code and the web chat API.

This command allows you to mark an image as obsolete, which means it will no longer be available for new instances or updates to existing instances. Marking an image as obsolete can be useful when you want to retire an older version of an image or when you want to encourage users to migrate to a newer version.\n\nThe second new command is `image-deprecate`. This command allows you to deprecate an image, which means it will be marked as obsolete and a deprecation message will be displayed when the image is used. Deprecating an image gives users advance notice that an image will no longer be available in the future.\n\nIn addition to these new commands, version 6.15.0 also added support for image lifecycle management in the `image-create`, `image-update`, and `images` commands. This means you can now use these commands to manage the lifecycle of your images, including marking them as obsolete or deprecated.\n\nIt's worth noting that these new commands and features are designed to help you manage your images more effectively and ensure that your VPC infrastructure remains up-to-date and secure. By using these new capabilities, you can more easily retire older images and encourage users to migrate to newer versions, which can help you maintain a more modern and secure VPC environment."}

This includes using machine learning models that are custom-built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time.\n\n2. **Embed existing help content**: If you have pre-existing data collections, you can add a search integration with IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery. This gives your assistant access to these data collections, allowing it to mine for answers more effectively.\n\n3. **Connect to your customer service teams**: If a customer needs more help or wants to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, you can connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider.\n\n4. **Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are**: Configure built-in integrations to publish your assistant on popular social media platforms or customer support channels. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website.\n\n5. **Track customer engagement and satisfaction**: Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant. This can help you gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement.\n\nAs for the Slackbot tutorial, ensuring harmony between the Slackbot, Watson Assistant, and the Db2 on Cloud database involves properly setting up the integration between Slack and Watson Assistant, creating and deploying a Python database app to Code Engine, and accessing the Db2 on Cloud database via a Watson Assistant custom extension.\n\nHowever, the documents do not provide information on cosmic energy or ethereal realms of data connectivity.
