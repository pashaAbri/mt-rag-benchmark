Data Integrity: Immutable Object Storage maintains data integrity in a WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) manner, ensuring that objects can't be modified until the end of their retention period and the removal of any legal holds.\n2. Long-term Data Retention: This feature can be used by any user that needs long-term data retention in their environment, including but not limited to organizations in industries such as Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives.\n3. Legal Compliance: Immutable Object Storage is useful for organizations that deal with financial records management, such as broker-dealer transactions, and might need to store data in a non-rewritable and non-erasable format due to legal or regulatory requirements.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Limited Availability: Immutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only, which might limit its accessibility for some users.\n2. Pricing: It requires a Standard pricing plan, which might be more expensive than other storage options.\n3. No High-speed Transfer: It isn't possible to use Aspera high-speed transfer with buckets with a retention policy, which could potentially slow down data transfer rates.\n4.

Verify the table and column names: Ensure that the table and column names in your query are spelled correctly and exist in your database.\n\n3. Grant proper permissions: Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to read data from the table. You need at least 'Reader' access to the buckets that contain the input objects.\n\n4. Specify the correct input format: If your input objects are in CSV format, you don't need to specify a STORED AS clause. However, if they're in JSON, ORC, Parquet, or AVRO format, you must specify the format after the FROM clause, like `FROM table_name STORED AS JSON`.\n\n5.

This can significantly speed up query execution.\n\n2. **Avoid using wildcard characters at the beginning of a phrase**: For example, instead of `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%search_term%';`, use `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'search_term%';`. The former has to scan the entire table, while the latter can use an index if one is available.\n\n3. **Use JOINs wisely**: Avoid unnecessary JOINs as they can slow down your query. Also, use EXISTS and IN clauses instead of JOINs where appropriate.\n\n4. **Limit the size of your result set**: If you only need a certain number of rows, use the LIMIT clause to restrict the number of rows returned.\n\n5. **Use the appropriate data types**: Make sure the columns you're querying are of the appropriate data type. For example, comparing a string to an integer will result in a full table scan.\n\n6. **Avoid using subqueries when possible**: Subqueries can often be replaced with JOINs, which are usually more efficient.\n\n7. **Use the ANALYZE statement**: The ANALYZE statement can provide information about your table and index statistics, which can help in optimizing your queries.\n\n8. **Normalize your database**: If your database is not normalized, it can lead to redundant data and slow queries. Normalization can help improve the performance of your queries.\n\n9. **Use the EXPLAIN PLAN statement**: The EXPLAIN PLAN statement can provide a detailed breakdown of how a query will be executed, which can help in identifying any potential performance issues.\n\n10. **Consider using a different database system**: If you're using a relational database system and your data is mostly read-only, consider using a column-oriented database system like Google Bigtable or Apache Cassandra, which can provide better performance for read-intensive workloads.\n\nRemember, the specific improvements you can make will depend on your specific use case and database system."}

This index can then be used in your queries to improve performance.\n\nHere is an example of a query using IBM Cloudant Query:\n\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX\\_NAME?include\\_docs=true&query=\":\"&limit=1 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\n\nIn this example, the query is looking for all documents in the database ($DATABASE) that match the index ($INDEX\\_NAME) and are limited to 1 result. The `include_docs=true` parameter ensures that the actual document content is returned as part of the query results.\n\nYou can also use programming languages such as Java, Node, Python, and Go to execute IBM Cloudant Query queries. Here is an example using Node:\n\nimport { CloudantV1 } from '@ibm-cloud/cloudant';\n\nconst service = CloudantV1.newInstance({});\n\nservice.postSearch({\ndb: '<db-name>',\nddoc: '<ddoc>',\nindex: '<index-name>',\nquery: ':',\nincludeDocs: true,\nlimit: 1\n});\n\nThis will execute the same query as the previous example, but using Node.\n\nFor more complex queries, you can use the Lucene query language to create queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nFor more information on IBM Cloudant Query, you can refer to the IBM Cloudant documentation: [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloudant?topic=cloudant-cloudant-query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloudant?topic=cloudant-cloudant-query)"}

You can store your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry, and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhen it comes to creating encrypted images, you can consider using image encryption tools or techniques to secure your images. However, keep in mind that any encryption applied on the image level will prevent Vulnerability Advisor from scanning the image for vulnerabilities. Therefore, you might want to consider implementing security measures during the image creation process or before encrypting the image.\n\nFor instance, you can use secure coding practices and continuously scan your codebase for vulnerabilities during the development process. This way, you can mitigate potential security risks before creating the image and encrypting it. Additionally, you can follow the principle of least privilege, only installing necessary packages and limiting the attack surface for potential threats.\n\nIn summary, while Vulnerability Advisor may not scan encrypted images, it's essential to establish checks and maintain security measures during the image creation process, before encryption, and when storing images in a secure registry."}

However, they do mention some security aspects related to restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC.\n\nWhen you restore a volume from a backup snapshot, the restored volume has the same capacity and IOPS tier profile as the original volume. If the backup is of a boot volume, you can use it to provision a new instance. However, restoring a boot volume from a bootable backup snapshot can result in degraded performance in the beginning, as the data is copied from IBM Cloud Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC, and the provisioned IOPS cannot be fully realized until that process finishes.\n\nAdditionally, you can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region for disaster recovery purposes. The remote copy can be created automatically as part of a backup plan, or manually later. If the source snapshot is not encrypted with a customer key, the encryption of the copy remains provider-managed. If the source snapshot is protected by a customer-managed key, you must specify the customer-managed key that you want to use to encrypt the new copy. Only one copy of the backup snapshot can exist in each region.\n\nThe fast restore feature allows you to cache snapshots in a specified zone of your choosing, enabling volumes to be restored from snapshots nearly immediately and the new volumes to operate with full IOPS instantly. When you use fast restore, the data is pulled from a cached backup snapshot in another zone of your VPC.\n\nAs for the evolving nature of cloud computing security protocols, it is a general trend that security measures become more robust and sophisticated over time, with new threats and vulnerabilities constantly being identified and addressed. However, the specifics of this evolution would depend on the particular cloud provider and the specific services they offer."}

This process is used to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, such as when data is transmitted over a network or stored in a database. The encrypted data can only be deciphered back into its original form using the correct decryption key. Data encryption is a crucial component of data security and privacy in both cloud and on-premises environments."}

While data backup is often a component of disaster recovery, the two are distinct processes. Encryption may be used as part of a data backup or disaster recovery strategy to further protect data, but it is not the same as data backup or disaster recovery itself."}

It allows you to establish your own virtual private cloud by defining a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants. VPC provides fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and network traffic segmentation. The underlying software defined networking (SDN) and virtual network functions allow for quick establishment of network constructs and on-prem connectivity needed to run your workload.\n\nIn VPC, network isolation takes place at three levels: Hypervisor, Network, and Router. Hypervisor isolation ensures that a virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC. Network isolation occurs by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs), which are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC, and it is stripped off when the packet leaves a zone. The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone.\n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. They optimize routing over the MPLS VPN while avoiding pathological routing cases.\n\nThe documents provided do not contain specific information about the evolution of cloud computing security protocols over time. However, they do cover some aspects of security related to restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC. When you restore a volume from a backup snapshot, the restored volume has the same capacity and IOPS tier profile as the original volume.

Use the free trial cluster to test and get familiar with the platform before deploying your applications to a standard cluster.\n2. Choose the appropriate container management platform for your cluster, either the IBM version of community Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n3. Implement security best practices using tools like the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.\n4. Use the Continuous Integration (CI) toolchain to run a static code scanner, build a container image on every Git commit, test the Dockerfile before the image is created, store the built image in a private image registry, and scan the container image for security vulnerabilities.\n5. Use the Continuous Deployment (CD) toolchain to ensure that your deployed artifacts and their source repositories are always compliant.\n6. Ensure that you have access groups defined so only certain users have the ability to create and manage the VPC network settings.\n7. Choose a VPC networking setup when creating your cluster so that certain cluster components can communicate with each other and with networks or services outside of the cluster.\n\nThese practices will help ensure that your applications are secure, compliant, and highly available on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nFor more information, see the IBM Cloud documentation for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and DevSecOps best practices."}

You can also leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect malicious activities and suspicious usage patterns.\n\nRegarding access policies for your cluster users, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies you assign users depend on what you want your users to be able to do. You can find more information about what roles authorize which types of actions on the User access reference page or in the following table's links. You can assign various roles to meet different use cases, such as:\n\n* Editor: Create, update, and delete cluster resources\n* Operator: Manage and monitor cluster resources\n* Viewer: View cluster resources\n* Auditor: View audit logs and events\n\nFor steps to assign policies, see Granting users access to your cluster through IBM Cloud IAM.\n\nFor securing apps in your cluster, consider the following options:\n\n* Image security: Protect your app by protecting the image and establishing checks to ensure the image's integrity. For example, use Vulnerability Advisor to check the security status of container images.\n* Encrypt sensitive information in the cluster, such as the master's local disk and secrets.\n* Set up a private image registry for your developers.\n* Set pod priority to indicate the relative priority of the pods that make up your cluster's workload.\n* Authorize who can create and update pods by configuring security context constraints (SCCs).\n* Control traffic to and from your cluster with VPC security groups.\n* Restrict network traffic to edge worker nodes.\n* Set up a firewall by using a gateway appliance or Calico network policies.\n\nFor more information, see Security for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service documentation, and DevSecOps best practices."}

One possibility is that the key you want to delete is in Active state. In this case, you need to deactivate the key first before you can delete it. Another possibility is that the key is associated with resources and their data. When you change the Active key to Deactivated state, the key is detached from all the target keystores, and not accessible to all associated resources and their data. However, you can still reactivate the key so that it is accessible to the resources again. If you are trying to delete a key ring, you might need to transfer keys to a different ring first, as a key ring cannot be deleted as long as it contains keys in any state. If you have the service \"Manager\" role of both the key being transferred and the target key ring, you can transfer a key from one key ring to another using the UI or the API.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the documents titled \"Deleting managed keys with the IBM Cloud console\", \"Managing user access\", and \"Transferring a key to a different key ring with the UI\" or \"Transferring a key to a different key ring with the API\".\n\nIf you are trying to delete a key in Hyper Protect Crypto Services, there is a 7-day waiting period that starts after you provide the first authorization to delete the key. During this 7-day period, the key remains in the [Active state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-key-states) and all key operations are allowed on the key.

In the event of a regional disaster, the estimated recovery time for rebuilding the regional site and restoring the service at another location is 24 hours. Users must update the endpoints of applications and monitoring agents to point to the ingestion endpoint in the new location and restore the service instance's metadata from their backups. It's also important to note that historical data may be lost during a disaster, so it's recommended to backup the metrics regularly for auditing purposes.\n\nIn case of a disaster, users can continue working by implementing a manual failover to switch to another region while the region is being restored. To reduce the time to get up and running in a new location, users should backup their alerts, notifications, dashboards, and team definitions on a regular basis.\n\nIf applications and services are all co-located in the same region, users must wait for the region to be available again for business. However, if monitoring agents are deployed on systems that are not impacted by the regional failure, users can redirect metrics to other instances of monitoring in a different region.\n\nRegarding Unified Key Orchestrator, when a user authorizes a key for deletion, it remains in the Active state for seven days, during which all key operations are allowed on the key. The second user with a Manager role can delete the key at any point during those seven days, at which time the key will be moved to the Destroyed state.

When you enable security, you can authenticate users, encrypt sensitive data, and restrict access to your assistant. All messages sent between the web chat and the assistant are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, to ensure end-to-end encryption and secure authentication, you need to implement JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in your web application server code. JWTs are digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, ensuring that each message originates from your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data. For more information, refer to the documentation on [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable)."}

This cookie remains active for 45 days. For more information, see [Adding user identity information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-userid).\n\nIf you don't want to use the built-in user identity handling, you can also generate a randomized universally unique ID to represent each anonymous user. For more information about UUIDs, see [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html).\n\nIt is important to choose a non-human-identifiable ID that doesn't change throughout the customer lifecycle. For example, don't use a person's email address as the user ID. In fact, the user\\_id syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230section-3.2).\n\nHere's an example of how to set the `user_id` property:\n\n<script>\nwindow.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {\nintegrationID: 'YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID',\nregion: 'YOUR_REGION',\nserviceInstanceID: 'YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE',\nuser_id: 'YOUR_USER_ID',\nonLoad: function(instance) {\ninstance.render();\n}\n};\nsetTimeout(function(){\nconst t=document.createElement('script');\nt.src = \"https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/loading.js\";\ndocument.head.appendChild(t);\n}, 1500);\n</script>\n\nJust replace `'YOUR_USER_ID'` with the desired user ID."}
