This control allows you to choose the period for which data is displayed, and it affects all data shown on the page. You can view data for a single day, a week, a month, or a quarter, and the data points on the graph will adjust to an appropriate measurement period. Additionally, you can create custom time periods, such as a week that runs from Thursday to the following Wednesday, or a month that begins on any date other than the first."}

Let's say you want to create an alert for a specific intent in your skill that is not being used as frequently as you'd like. Here's how you might define that alert:\n\n1. Select the custom time period for which you want to monitor the metric. For example, you might choose to monitor the metric for the past week.\n2. Use the Intents filter to select the specific intent you want to monitor.\n3. Set a threshold for the number of times you expect the intent to be used within the selected time period. For example, you might set a threshold of 100 uses.\n4. Define the alert to trigger if the intent is used fewer than 80 times within the selected time period.\n\nYou can also create alerts based on other metrics and conditions. For example, you might create an alert that triggers if your assistant's response time exceeds a certain threshold, or if the number of customer interactions exceeds a certain limit within a given time period.\n\nRemember that the statistics can cover a longer time period than the period for which logs of conversations are retained. So, it's important to choose a time period for your alerts that reflects the frequency and volume of the events you want to monitor."}

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:\n\n1. Check the syntax of your query: Make sure you're using the correct syntax for a SELECT statement. The basic structure is `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;`.\n\n2. Verify your permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the data you're trying to query. You need at least 'Reader' access to the buckets that contain the input objects.\n\n3. Examine the input objects: Make sure the input objects you're referencing in your query are in the correct format and location. If the format is CSV, no special options are required, but if it's JSON, ORC, Parquet, or AVRO, you need to specify the format using the `STORED AS` clause.\n\n4. Delimiters and headers: If your input objects are in CSV format and use a delimiter other than a comma, or they don't have a header line, you need to specify these details in your query using the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` option and the `WITH HEADER` or ` WITHOUT HEADER` clause.\n\n5. Use Data Engine's web UI or SDKs: You can submit your SQL queries through Data Engine's web UI, the REST API, Python or Node.JS SDKs, or IBM Watson\u00ae Studio with the Python SDK. Make sure you're using the method that best suits your needs and that you've correctly configured your environment.\n\n6.

This is because the schema inference required for these formats can be skipped when the information is available in the metastore.\n\n2. **Common table expressions**: Using common table expressions (CTEs) can help avoid the overhead of creating and dropping intermediate result objects on Cloud Object Storage. They are also beneficial when the same result table must be shared in a fullselect. CTEs are defined by using the `WITH` keyword followed by one or more named queries.\n\n3. **Limit the data retrieved**: If you're using a `SELECT` statement, you can specify a limit to the number of rows of data you would like to retrieve. This can help improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\n\n4. **Optimize your SQL queries**: Make sure your queries are as efficient as possible. Avoid using complex subqueries or joins if simpler alternatives exist. Also, ensure that any indexes on your tables are being used effectively.\n\n5. **Use the correct data format**: If your data is in CSV format, it's more efficient to leave it uncompressed. If it's in a format like JSON, ORC, Parquet, or AVRO, make sure you're specifying the format correctly in your query using the `STORED AS` clause.\n\nRemember, the specific steps to improve your query can vary depending on the details of your database, the data you're working with, and the specific query you're running."}

It allows you to create flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. To use IBM Cloudant Query, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a design document: In IBM Cloudant, a design document is a JSON document that contains query definitions, views, and other database-related settings. You can create a design document using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard or by making a PUT request to the `/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC` endpoint.\n2. Define an index: Within a design document, you can define one or more indexes using the `_index` property. An index is a data structure that enables fast lookup of documents based on specific fields. Here's an example index definition:\n```json\n{\n  \"_index\": {\n    \"fields\": [\n      {\n        \"author\": \"string\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"year\": \"number\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nThis index enables fast lookup of documents based on the `author` and `year` fields.\n\n3. Define a query: Within a design document, you can define one or more queries using the `_search` property. A query is a set of search criteria that enables you to retrieve specific documents from the database. Here's an example query definition:\n```json\n{\n  \"_search\": {\n    \"index\": \"my_index\",\n    \"query\": \"(author:Dickens) AND (year:[1800 TO 1850])\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis query retrieves documents where the `author` field is \"Dickens\" and the `year` field is between 1800 and 1850.\n\n4. Run the query: Once you've defined an index and a query, you can run the query by making a GET or POST request to the `/$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX_NAME` endpoint. Here's an example query using the IBM Cloudant Query syntax:\n```bash\nGET /mydb/_design/ddoc/_search/my_index?query=\"(author:Dickens) AND"}

{"_id": "c6c3b02ca32795af64c903dd76700517<::>5", "text": "|user|: What is difference between Vulnerability Advisor version 3 and version 4?", "agent_response": "According to the document, the main difference between Vulnerability Advisor version 3 and version 4 is in how they handle vulnerability assessment. In version 3, the image is indexed the first time that it is pushed, and thereafter, the vulnerability assessment is calculated every 5 days. However, in version 4, the image is indexed the first time that it is pushed, and the vulnerability assessment is calculated every time Vulnerability Advisor is queried about that image.\n\nAdditionally, version 4 has updated supported Docker base images that it checks for vulnerable packages. The full list of supported Docker base images and their respective sources of security notices can be found in the document.\n\nFor more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nAnd to get Vulnerability Advisor v4, you should update to Container Registry plug-in 1.0.0 or a later version. You can see the release notes for more information on how to update at [Vulnerability Advisor 4 is available from Container Registry plug-in 1.0.0](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_release_notes15sep2022_va_version_4)"}
{"_id": "c6c3b02ca32795af64c903dd76700517<::>6", "text": "|user|: How should I proceed if I want to create an encrypted image, given that Vulnerability Advisor cannot scan encrypted images?", "agent_response": "Even though Vulnerability Advisor cannot scan encrypted images for vulnerabilities, you can still create and use encrypted images for added security. You would just need to manage the security of the image and its contents outside of the Vulnerability Advisor tool.\n\nFor instance, you can use container image encryption technologies, such as those provided by Docker, to secure your encrypted images. This can help protect the image's integrity and contents from unauthorized access. However, you would need to ensure that the encryption does not interfere with the proper functioning of the image and its deployment in your environment.\n\nRemember that while encrypted images are protected from being read or tampered with, they still may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited if the image is deployed. It is important to maintain good security practices and ensure that your images are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities and updated as needed, even if they are encrypted.\n\nIn summary, while Vulnerability Advisor cannot scan encrypted images, you can still create encrypted images for added security. However, you would need to manage the security and vulnerabilities of the image outside of Vulnerability Advisor and ensure that the encryption does not interfere with the image's deployment and functionality."}

According to the documents, you can grant access to your resources by configuring IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for IBM Cloud Container Registry. You can set up and manage IAM access policies using the instructions in [Defining IAM access policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-useruser). For more information about how to use IAM to manage access to your resources, see [Managing access to resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources).\n\nBefore granting access to a user, you need to ensure that you have the correct access permissions for adding and removing namespaces. For more information about access roles for configuring IBM Cloud Container Registry, see [Access roles for configuring IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iamaccess_roles_configure).\n\nTo authorize a user to configure the registry, follow the instructions in [Authorize a user to configure the registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iam_access#iam_access__registry_access).\n\nOnce you have authorized a user to configure the registry, they can access any namespace created in the account. If you want to differentiate access at the namespace level, you can create a subset of users and set an IAM access policy for them. Users can be members of many accounts, but you cannot give access outside the account, that is, you cannot share a namespace to multiple accounts. For more information about IAM access policies, see [Defining IAM access policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-useruser).\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions about granting access to IBM Cloud Container Registry resources."}

For managing transfer failures, you can configure a 'Transfer failure message' and choose whether to 'Disconnect call on transfer failure' or process a different action. If you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. Ensure that the Assistant is configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario. Furthermore, the phone integration supports disaster recovery by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.\n\nWhen using third-party providers, you should also consider security measures. You can add security to the phone connection by selecting 'Force secure trunking' to use Secure Real-Time Transfer Protocol (SRTP) to secure the audio that is transmitted over the phone. Enabling SIP authentication requires SIP digest authentication for all inbound traffic and must be sent using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

You can use VMs for most general-purpose use cases, while bare metal servers are more suitable for high-performance computing for data- or RAM-intensive workloads.\n\nThe ownership of a worker node depends on the type of cluster that you create and the infrastructure provider that you choose. For classic clusters in IBM Cloud, worker nodes are provisioned into your account and are dedicated to you. You are responsible for requesting timely updates to ensure that the worker node OS and IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service components apply the latest security updates and patches. For VPC clusters, worker nodes are provisioned in an IBM Cloud account owned by IBM to enable monitoring of malicious activities and apply security updates. You can manage your worker nodes by using the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service console, CLI, or API, while the virtual machines that make up your worker nodes are dedicated to you and you are responsible for requesting timely updates.\n\nIt's important to ensure that your app is protected from unauthorized access, changes, or monitoring by using worker nodes. IBM provides tools and best practices to help you secure your worker nodes and Kubernetes components. You can use the ibmcloud oc worker update command to deploy updates and security patches to the operating system and to update the Red Hat OpenShift version that your worker nodes run. When updates are available, you are notified through the IBM Cloud console or CLI. Worker node updates are provided by IBM as a full worker node image that includes the latest security patches.\n\nIf you encounter issues with worker nodes, such as memory, disk, or PID problems, you can follow the steps in the provided document to isolate the problem workload and reload or replace the affected workers one at a time. If all worker nodes in a single zone, subnet, or VLAN are affected, there might be an issue with a networking component. Keep in mind the service limitations, such as app URL length, Istio managed add-on, network speeds, NodePort, and"}

With VPC clusters, you can provision worker nodes in a VPC to take advantage of features such as secure and flexible networking, and isolated infrastructure. VPC clusters also provide you with more control over your networking configuration, such as the ability to configure your own subnets, IP ranges, and load balancers. Additionally, VPC clusters offer security benefits, such as VPC security groups that can be used to filter traffic at the hypervisor level. The ownership of worker nodes in a VPC cluster depends on the infrastructure provider. For IBM Cloud, worker nodes in VPC clusters are provisioned in an IBM Cloud account owned by IBM, and you can manage them using the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service console, CLI, or API."}

For more information, you can refer to the [Regional pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs) page. Additionally, when you create a cluster on VPC infrastructure, worker nodes may incur an uplift charge that varies by the multizone location. The uplift charge is a percentage (%) of the hourly rate (r), and is added to the hourly rate of the worker node. The total hourly rate cost for a worker node can be calculated as r + (r \u00d7 %). This uplift is reflected in the pricing calculator in the Kubernetes cluster creation console as you configure your cluster details. For more details, you can refer to the [Regional pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs) page and the document on [What are the regional uplift charges and sustained usage discounts for VPC worker nodes?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-costscharges_vpc_gen2)."}

However, they do provide some insights into the security aspects of restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC.\n\nWhen you restore a volume from a backup snapshot in IBM Cloud VPC, the restored volume has the same capacity and IOPS tier profile as the original volume. However, the restoration process involves copying data from IBM Cloud Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC, which may result in degraded performance in the beginning.\n\nIn terms of security, you can add user tags and access management tags to your volumes. User tags are used by the backup service to automatically create backup snapshots of the volume, while access management tags help organize access to your Block Storage for VPC volumes.\n\nFor cross-regional backup copies, if the source snapshot is not encrypted with a customer key, the encryption of the copy remains provider-managed. If the source snapshot is protected by a customer-managed key, you must specify the customer-managed key that you want to use to encrypt the new copy. Only one copy of the backup snapshot can exist in each region.\n\nAs for the potential implications of evolving cloud computing security protocols, it's reasonable to expect that any changes would be designed to enhance security and protect data. However, specifics would depend on the nature of the changes, which are not covered in the provided documents."}

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that doesn't change. For example, if you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period.\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. With this model, you pay for what you consume.\n3. Tiered: Tiered pricing is based on volume-based discounts and is divided into tiers. The more you consume, the lower the price per unit. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. In the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. In the graduated tier model, the unit price per tier decreases as your level of usage increases. The total price is the cumulative charges for each level of usage.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!

When you create a stand-alone (unattached) block storage data volume, the volume bandwidth is assigned based on volume capacity, IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), and volume profile. The bandwidth for each attached volume is set proportionally based on the volume size and profile. For optimal bandwidth to be realized, detach and reattach the volume after volume bandwidth allocation in the UI, CLI, or API. You can adjust the volume/networking bandwidth ratio to meet your needs, but both volume and network bandwidth must be at least 500 Mbps each. The volume bandwidth available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes. If you have an instance with multiple attached volumes but are using only one volume, that volume can get only the bandwidth that is assigned to it. The volume bandwidth that is available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes. When the volume is canceled, the request is followed by a 24-hour reclaim wait period. You can still see the volume in the console during those 24 hours. Billing for the volume stops immediately.

{"_id": "be461bfeda2d4826cdb663dcaa7d1ced<::>9", "text": "|user|: What are the services provided by Virtual Network Functions?", "agent_response": "Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are network services that can be virtualized and run on commodity hardware. They include services such as routers, firewalls, and load balancers. These services are typically run on proprietary hardware, but with Network Function Virtualization (NFV), they can be packaged as virtual machines (VMs) and run on standard servers. This allows service providers to run their networks on standard servers instead of proprietary ones, which can lead to cost savings and increased agility. The IBM Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller is used to manage and configure these VNFs. Working along with IBM Cloud Schematics (Infrastructure as Code) and the IBM Content catalog, customers are able to instantiate best-in-network solutions to manage their workload. Benefits of using VNFs include the ability to instantiate virtual network services and modify configurations without the need to deploy new network hardware, rapid service delivery, centralized policy control, and the ability to use the same routers, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs in IBM Cloud that were used in physical hardware or other cloud providers."}

These commands support image lifecycle management.\n\nThe 'image-obsolete' command marks an image as obsolete, which means it is no longer available for use in creating new instances. Obsoleting an image prevents it from being accidentally used but does not affect any existing instances created from that image.\n\nThe 'image-deprecate' command marks an image as deprecated, which means it should no longer be used for creating new instances. Deprecating an image sends a warning to users that the image will be removed in the future. However, like obsoleting, deprecating an image does not affect any existing instances created from that image.\n\nThese new commands allow users to manage their images more efficiently and help maintain a clean and up-to-date image library. By marking images as obsolete or deprecated, users can avoid accidentally using outdated images and ensure that they are using the latest and most secure images available."}

However, they do provide information on how to build and optimize a Watson Assistant chatbot that integrates with various services and databases.\n\nTo ensure a smooth and efficient operation of your Watson Assistant chatbot, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create AI-driven conversational flows:** Use industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. Customize machine learning models to deliver accurate answers in real time.\n\n2. **Embed existing help content:** If you already have answers to customer questions, you can use these to train your assistant. Add a search integration to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers.\n\n3. **Connect to your customer service teams:** If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, you can connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider.\n\n4. **Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are:** Configure integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms or add it as a chat widget to your company website.\n\n5. **Track customer engagement and satisfaction:** Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement.\n\n6. **Integrate with databases:** If your chatbot needs to interact with a database, you can use a custom extension to expose a REST API against the database backend.\n\nRemember, while these steps can help optimize your chatbot, they do not directly address the concept of \"cosmic energy\" or \"ethereal realms\". These are philosophical or metaphysical concepts that are not grounded in the technical functionality of Watson Assistant or any other IBM product."}
