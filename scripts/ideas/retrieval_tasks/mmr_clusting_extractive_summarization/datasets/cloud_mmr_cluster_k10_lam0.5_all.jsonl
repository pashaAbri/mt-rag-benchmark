Slack alert: You can set up an alert to be sent to a Slack channel when there are more than 100 instances of a specific error message in a given hour. To do this, you would specify the Webhook URL for your Slack channel and the desired Message color.\n\n2. Email alert: You can configure an alert to be sent to a specific email address when the number of log entries for a particular application exceeds a certain threshold. For this type of alert, you would specify the Recipients' email addresses and the Timezone for the log entries.\n\n3. PagerDuty alert: You can create an alert that triggers a PagerDuty incident when a critical error occurs in your system. To do this, you would specify the PagerDuty Service that should be notified.\n\n4. Webhook alert: You can set up an alert to be sent to a custom webhook when a specific condition is met. For this type of alert, you would specify the Method, URL, and Headers and Body of the JSON used to interact with your webhook.\n\nIn each case, you can also customize the schedule for the alert, specifying the timezone, days of the week, and timeframe when the alert should be generated.

It is represented by time series, which is a unique combination of a metric name and label key-value pairs. Metrics can be used to analyze statistically data that has numerical values and can help identify and differentiate characteristics of a metric, such as grouping infrastructure objects into logical hierarchies, filtering out data, and splitting aggregated data into segments.\n\nThere are various platforms and orchestrators where metrics can be collected, including Prometheus, JMX, StatsD, Kubernetes, and other application stacks. Default metrics can be collected using the Monitoring agent, which automatically collects metadata that can be used to label, segment, and display metrics when monitoring infrastructure, network, and applications.\n\nTo compare metrics for different periods, you can use the Time period control in the user interface to choose the period for which data is displayed. This affects all data shown on the page, including the graph, statistics, and lists of top intents and entities. You can view data for a single day, a week, a month, or a quarter, and create custom time periods as well.\n\nI hope this helps clarify your understanding of metrics.

Long-term Data Retention: This feature can be used by any user that needs long-term data retention in their environment. It's particularly useful for organizations in industries like Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives.\n3. Legal Compliance: Retention policies can also be used by organizations that deal with financial records management, such as broker-dealer transactions, and might need to store data in a non-rewritable and non-erasable format.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Regional Availability: Immutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only.\n2. Pricing: It requires a Standard pricing plan.\n3. No High-speed Transfer: It isn't possible to use Aspera high-speed transfer with buckets with a retention policy.\n4.

This API allows you to run SQL queries and retrieve information about their status. However, since you mentioned \"query API\" in general, I'll provide a brief overview.\n\nA query API is an application programming interface that enables you to retrieve, manipulate, and update data stored in a database or a data store by sending HTTP requests. Query APIs usually support various HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with data and return the results in a structured format (commonly JSON or XML).\n\nThe specifics of a query API depend on the underlying data store and the API implementation. However, most query APIs support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and may offer additional features like filtering, sorting, pagination, and querying based on specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, if you're using IBM Watson Discovery, its Query API allows you to search and analyze your data using a powerful query language designed for unstructured content. You can find more information about the IBM Watson Discovery Query API in the following documentation: <https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery-data?curl=#query-api>\n\nKeep in mind that the specifics of the query API you use will depend on the data store and platform you're working with.

It supports a wide range of query types, including full-text search, numeric range queries, and faceted navigation.\n\nTo use IBM Cloudant Query, you first need to create a design document that defines the indexes you want to use for your query. A design document is a JSON document that contains one or more index definitions, as well as any query functions or views that you want to use.\n\nOnce you have created a design document, you can use the _search endpoint to execute queries against the indexes defined in your design document. The _search endpoint supports several parameters, including the index name, the query string, and the include_docs parameter, which allows you to include the full document in the query results.\n\nHere's an example of a query that uses IBM Cloudant Query to search for documents with a specific author and year:\n\nGET /$DATABASE/_design/$DDOC/_search/$INDEX\\_NAME?include\\_docs=true&query=\"author:\\\"Dickens\\\" AND year:1840\" HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\nHost: $ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\n\nIn this example, the query string \"author:\\\"Dickens\\\" AND year:1840\" searches for documents where the author field is equal to \"Dickens\" and the year field is equal to 1840. The include\\_docs parameter is set to true, so the full document is included in the query results.\n\nYou can also use the IBM Cloudant Query API to execute queries programmatically from your application.

To create an encrypted image, you can use various tools and techniques, such as Docker's built-in encryption feature or third-party tools like `cryptsetup` or `dm-crypt`. However, keep in mind that encrypted images are not scanned by Vulnerability Advisor, so you will not be able to detect any security issues in them using this tool.\n\nHere is an example of how to create an encrypted image using Docker's built-in encryption:\n\n1. Create a new image based on a secure base image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`).\n2. Add any necessary files or applications to the image.\n3. Commit the changes to the image.\n4. Encrypt the image using the `docker commit` command with the `--encrypt` option.\n5. Push the encrypted image to a secure registry.\n\nHere is an example command to create an encrypted image:\n```sql\n$ docker commit --encrypt my_image my_encrypted_image\n```\nIn this example, `my_image` is the name of the original image, and `my_encrypted_image` is the name of the new encrypted image.\n\nNote that encrypted images may have some limitations, such as increased storage requirements and slower performance, so you should consider these factors before deciding to encrypt your images."}

To set up a namespace, you can follow the steps in the document titled \"[Set up a namespace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-startedgs_registry_namespace_add)\".\n\nIn summary, you can use the `ibmcloud cr namespace-add` command followed by the name of the new namespace to create a namespace. The name of the namespace must meet certain requirements, such as being unique across all IBM Cloud accounts in the same region, having 4-30 characters, starting and ending with a letter or number, and containing only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.\n\nOnce you have created a namespace, you can configure access to resources within that namespace at the resource group level by assigning the namespace to a resource group. You can use the `ibmcloud cr namespace-assign` command followed by the name of the namespace and the name or ID of the resource group to assign a namespace to a resource group.\n\nIt is important to note that if you have the Manager role at the account level, you can add or remove namespaces. However, if you don't have the Manager role, you may need to request access from an administrator.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a namespace is already set up for your account, you can run the `ibmcloud cr namespace-list` command with the `-v` option to retrieve existing namespace information.\n\nI hope this helps!

{"_id": "b4614daadceeecb400f7baf0aa48dcb8<::>2", "text": "|user|: Could you provide more information about the WebSocket API?", "agent_response": "The WebSocket API is a protocol that enables real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server. It is used in the Text to Speech service on IBM Cloud to send two types of parameters: query parameters and message parameters.\n\nQuery parameters are sent when the phone integration connects to the service and are used to specify how the data should be searched and filtered. They typically include information such as the access token for authentication, the voice synthesis settings, and any other options for customizing the service.\n\nMessage parameters, on the other hand, are sent as part of the JSON data in the request body and are used to control the behavior of the service during a conversation. For example, you can use message parameters to specify the voice that the assistant should use, to enable or disable speech barge-in, or to transfer a call to a live agent.\n\nFor more information about the WebSocket API and its parameters, you can refer to the Text to Speech API documentation on IBM Cloud. It is also worth noting that if the socket closes with an error, the client will receive an informative message of the form {\"error\":\"{message}\"} before the socket closes. You can use the onerror event handler to respond appropriately.\n\nI hope this information is helpful! If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask."}
{"_id": "b4614daadceeecb400f7baf0aa48dcb8<::>3", "text": "|user|: How can I use WebSocket API?", "agent_response": "To use the WebSocket API, you first need to establish a connection with the service using the /v1/synthesize method over the WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol. The method should be called at the following endpoint: wss://api.{location}.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com/instances/{instance\\_id}/v1/synthesize where {location} indicates where your application is hosted and {instance\\_id} is the unique identifier of the service instance.\n\nOnce the connection is established, you can send text and binary messages over the connection to initiate and manage recognition requests. The WebSocket interface is the preferred mechanism for speech recognition due to its advantages. For more information about the WebSocket interface and its parameters, you can refer to the API & SDK reference on IBM Cloud.\n\nFor client-side entities like mobile apps, an API call fetches the current configuration state when a user opens the app or brings it to the foreground. If you need more sophisticated monitoring, you can create an IBM Cloud Monitoring instance from the Observability section of the IBM Cloud console.\n\nFor more information about App Configuration cost, you can use the IBM Cloud Cost Estimator tool or refer to the guidelines for predicting cost in detail. The Application Instance cost is a fixed monthly cost, while the Active Entity ID cost is based on the number of unique entities that interact with your App Configuration instance during the month.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need more specific information, feel free to ask!"}

You can specify the SIP endpoint for your support agent service or a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues in the SIP target when a call fails field. Additionally, you can configure a message for the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent, as well as a message for when transfer to a live agent fails. If you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step.\n\nHowever, if you want to use third-party providers for disaster recovery, you may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only switch the call to the backup region when all the zones in a single region fail. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\nIf you need to handle partial service outages, Watson Assistant can respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent. This can be used to redirect the call to another zone or another region. You can request this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance from IBM.\n\nIt's also recommended to plan for both full and partial service outages, starting with a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment."}

This process can be done during instance creation, instance modification, or when you provision a new stand-alone volume. For data volumes, you can also use the volumes API to create a data volume from a snapshot. \n\nFor best performance, you can enable snapshots for fast restore. This feature allows you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. \n\nIt's important to note that restoring a volume from a backup snapshot may result in degraded performance in the beginning, as the data is copied from IBM Cloud Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC. \n\nYou can also copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region for disaster recovery scenarios. The cross-regional copy can be used to turn on your virtual server instance and data volumes in a different region. \n\nThe fast restore feature allows you to cache snapshots in a specified zone of your choosing, which enables volumes to be restored from snapshots nearly immediately and the new volumes to operate with full IOPS instantly. \n\nWhen using fast restore, the data is pulled from a cached backup snapshot in another zone of your VPC. \n\nCost for backups is calculated based on GB capacity that is stored per month. The backup exists on the account until it reaches its retention period, or when you delete it manually, or when you reach the end of a billing cycle, whichever comes first. \n\nPricing of subsequent backups can increase or decrease when you adjust IOPS by specifying a different IOPS profile for the source volume. Billing for an updated volume is automatically updated to add the prorated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle. \n\nPricing for backups is also set by region of the source volume. \n\nUsing the backup service, you can regularly back up your volume data based on a schedule that you set up.

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed-upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted, regardless of usage. This pricing model is typically used for services with predictable usage or flat-rate services.\n\n2. Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. It's a usage-based pricing model, where you pay for what you consume.\n\n3. Tiered: Tiered pricing is based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans, with the price decreasing as the usage increases. This pricing model is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls.\n\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. This pricing model is typically used for services where you can make a long-term commitment, such as Db2 on Cloud.\n\nIt's important to understand the pricing structure of the specific services you are utilizing to ensure accurate cost estimation and control."}

These features include securing the Kubernetes API server, etcd data store, worker node, network, storage, images, and deployments against malicious attacks. You can also leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect malicious attacks and suspicious usage patterns.\n\nWhen it comes to access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources. There are two types of access policies: IAM platform access roles and IAM service access roles. The access policies that you assign users vary depending on what you want your users to be able to do. You can find more information about what roles authorize which types of actions on the User access reference page or in the following table's links.\n\nIf you want to restrict access to your cluster, you can create custom roles and bind them to users or teams. You can also use Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies to control access to Kubernetes resources within your cluster.\n\nFor more information about how to secure your cluster and assign access policies, you can refer to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service documentation on Security and Access Control.\n\nIf you have data that must be available, even if an outage occurs, make sure to store your data on persistent storage. Additionally, for high availability, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation on High availability for Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\nRegarding the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, it is a set of specific steps to configure Kubernetes more securely. You can follow the guidelines in the IBM Cloud documentation to implement the benchmark in your cluster.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns related to the security of your IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you."}

Attachments are Binary Large OBject (BLOB) files included within documents. To create a new attachment at the same time as creating a new document, you can include the attachment as an inline component of the JSON content. For an existing document, you can make a PUT request with the document's most recent revision to a specific URL to create or update an attachment. However, it's important to keep in mind that larger binary data attachments can impact performance and increase costs, so it's recommended to store only attachment metadata in IBM Cloudant documents and use a separate block store for larger binary files. For more information on attachments, you can refer to the IBM Cloudant documentation on how to use attachments."}

Individual documents cannot exceed 1 MB, single attachments are limited to 10 MB, and the request body size cannot be more than 11 MB. If these limits are exceeded, a 413 response will be returned. The IBM Cloudant team recommends storing binary attachments or large JSON blobs in object storage and saving a link to the location in an IBM Cloudant JSON document. When replicating, documents or attachments that exceed these limits do not replicate to the target database. For more information about how to detect replication errors, see [Replication errors](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantgetreplicationdocument).\n\nRegarding the database size limit, it is recommended to consult the IBM Cloudant team if your database is likely to exceed 5 TB in size, as shown in Table 1 of the Databases section.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the document size should be kept small (ideally in single-digit KB) for optimal performance, since JSON decoding becomes costly as documents grow. Avoid using attachments for larger binary files, such as images and videos, as they can impact performance and increase costs. Instead, store only attachment metadata in IBM Cloudant documents and use a separate block store for larger binary files."}

It includes all of IBM Cloudant's functions, but the provisioned throughput capacity and data storage are fixed at 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB, respectively. This means that if you exceed the 1 GB data storage limit, you will not be able to write new data unless you upgrade to a paid plan or delete data to reduce your storage usage. Additionally, you can only have one IBM Cloudant Lite plan instance per IBM Cloud account.\n\nOn the other hand, the Standard plan for IBM Cloudant is a paid plan that offers configurable provisioned throughput capacity and data storage pricing that scales as your application requirements change. This means that you can store more than 1 GB of data and adjust the provisioned throughput capacity to meet the needs of your application.\n\nOverall, the main difference between the Lite and Standard plans is that the Lite plan has fixed and limited resources, while the Standard plan offers more flexibility and scalability for a fee."}

Determine the type of firewall rule you need to create (access-rules, ua-rules, or lockdowns).\n2. Identify the DNS domain ID associated with the domain you want to apply the rule to. This is required for ua-rules and lockdowns type rules.\n3. Use the `ibmcloud cis firewall-update` command with the appropriate parameters to create your firewall rule.\n\nFor example, to create a lockdown rule for a specific domain, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nibmcloud cis firewall-update e6106d7ec58e47ebb2fa053dedcd7dcb -t lockdowns -d 31984fea73a15b45779fa0df4ef62f9b --json '{\"urls\": [\"api.mysite.com/some/endpoint\"], \"configurations\": [{\"target\": \"ip\", \"value\": \"127.0.0.1\"}, {\"target\": \"ip_range\", \"value\": \"2.2.2.0/24\"}]}' -i \"cis-demo\"\n```\n\nThis command will lock down access to the specified URLs to only the IP address and IP range you specified.\n\n4. Test your firewall rule to ensure that it is working as intended.\n\nRemember that firewall rules can be based on IP address, IP address range, Autonomous System Number (ASN), or country/region. Also, keep in mind that domain lockdown rules specify a list of IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or networks that can access a domain, subdomain, or URL, and anything not on the list is blocked."}

To remove a scheduled status change, see [Remove a scheduled custom image lifecycle status change by using the CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-custom-imagesschedule-reset-ilm-status-change-cli). After you remove the scheduled status change, you can make an immediate status change.\n\nIf you want to schedule the status change for a future date and time, you can use the `--deprecate-at` or `--obsolete-at` option with the `ibmcloud is image-update` command and specify a date in the ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm) date and time format.\n\nFor example, to schedule the image to be deprecated on a specific date and time:\n\n`ibmcloud is image-update IMAGE --deprecate-at YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`\n\nReplace `IMAGE` with the name or ID of the custom image you want to update, and replace `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm` with the date and time you want to schedule the deprecation for.\n\nYou can also schedule the image to be obsolete at a specific date and time using the `--obsolete-at` option with the `ibmcloud is image"}

First, you need to find out the exact date and time for one month and two months from now in the ISO 8601 date and time format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm). Once you have the dates, you can use the `ibmcloud is image-update` command with the `--obsolete-at` or `--deprecate-at` option to schedule the status change for the desired dates. The command would look something like this:\n\nTo schedule the image to be deprecated in two months:\n`ibmcloud is image-update IMAGE --deprecate-at YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`\n\nReplace `IMAGE` with the name or ID of the custom image you want to update, and replace `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm` with the date and time you want to schedule the deprecation for.\n\nTo schedule the image to be obsolete in one month:\n`ibmcloud is image-update IMAGE --obsolete-at YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`\n\nReplace `IMAGE` with the name or ID of the custom image you want to update, and replace `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm` with the date and time you want to schedule the obsolescence for."}

There's no mention of achieving a state of \"perfect harmony with the cosmic energy of the universe\" or \"communion with the ethereal realms of data connectivity\" as described in your query.\n\nHowever, you can certainly optimize the performance and effectiveness of your Watson Assistant chatbot by following best practices. This includes creating AI-driven conversational flows, embedding existing help content, connecting to customer service teams, and tracking customer engagement and satisfaction. For instance, you can use a search skill to route complex customer inquiries to Discovery, allowing your assistant to search for relevant information and return it as a response. \n\nIf you have any specific questions about the features or capabilities of Watson Assistant as described in the documents, feel free to ask!"}

The system calculates a score for each emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness) on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. If the score of any emotion is 0.5 or higher, then that emotion is detected. The higher the score above 0.5, the higher the relevance.\n\nFor example, in the provided snippet of a document enriched with Emotion Analysis, the emotion of \"disgust\" has a score of 0.102578. This score is below the 0.5 threshold, so Watson did not detect \"disgust\" in this particular text.\n\nIf you want to improve the detection of disgust in your text, you can train the system with examples that contain words or phrases associated with this emotion. Additionally, you can enable fuzzy matching if you think your customers may not use the appropriate accents or may misspell words."}
{"_id": "674aa142d92a6b4262de254df0c3f7b2<::>5", "text": "|user|: Why don't you provide a specific list of words that can be detected to indicate disgust?", "agent_response": "I apologize if my previous response did not fully meet your expectations. I can certainly try to provide examples of words that might indicate disgust in a text. However, it's important to note that the Emotion Analysis feature of Watson Assistant looks at the overall context and tone of the text to detect emotions, rather than relying on a specific list of words.\n\nThat being said, here are some examples of words or phrases that might indicate disgust in a text:\n\n* \"disgusting\"\n* \"revolting\"\n* \"nauseating\"\n* \"repulsive\"\n* \"gross\"\n* \"vile\"\n* \"loathsome\"\n* \"filthy\"\n* \"putrid\"\n* \"foul\"\n\nAgain, the Emotion Analysis feature takes into account the broader context of the text to detect emotions, so the presence of these words alone is not a guarantee that the emotion of \"disgust\" will be detected."}

A VPC can be a building block that encapsulates a corporate division (marketing, development, accounting, ...) or a collection of microservices owned by a DevSecOps team. VPCs can be connected to an on-premises enterprise and each other. This may create the need to route traffic through centralized firewall-gateway appliances. IBM provides tutorials and documentation to guide users in implementing a hub and spoke architecture and connecting locations using Direct Link. The VPC's networking is isolated at the hypervisor, network, and router levels, using virtual network identifiers (VNIs) and the implicit routing function to ensure secure and efficient communication between virtual server instances. IBM VPC also offers features such as fast restore, backup snapshots, and data encryption for added data protection and performance."}

Monthly Billing: Subscription accounts are billed monthly based on consumption, while Enterprise Savings Plan accounts are billed timely, independent of usage.\n\n2. Invoicing: Subscription accounts are invoiced on monthly consumption, while Enterprise Savings Plan accounts are invoiced on monthly consumption as well, but the invoices are not adjusted based on usage.\n\n3. Best Suited For: Subscription accounts are best suited for developers and companies, while Enterprise Savings Plan accounts are best suited for enterprise organizations.\n\n4. Cost Estimation: Subscription accounts provide a 10% discount on usage costs for a yearly spending commitment, while Enterprise Savings Plan accounts offer similar benefits with added advantages.\n\n5. Fixed Billing: Subscription accounts offer a fixed billing amount for the subscription period, while Enterprise Savings Plan accounts also provide fixed billing for financial planning.\n\nAdditionally, the document mentions that with an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. The charging types include Fixed (based on an agreed upon monthly charge), Metered (based on the number of GB hours for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers), and Tiered (based on a tiered pricing model with volume-based discounts)."}
