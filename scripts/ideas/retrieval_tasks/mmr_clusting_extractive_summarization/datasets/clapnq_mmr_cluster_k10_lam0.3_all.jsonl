In soccer, players score goals by kicking a ball into a net without using their hands, while in American football, goals are scored by carrying or throwing a ball into an opponent's end zone. Additionally, in American football, a greater emphasis is placed on physical contact, with players wearing protective gear and tackling being a fundamental aspect of the game. Soccer, on the other hand, is generally a lower-contact sport, with slide tackling being the primary form of physical play.\n\nFurthermore, there are differences in the structure and rules of the two sports. For instance, soccer matches consist of two 45-minute halves, while American football games are divided into four 15-minute quarters. Additionally, soccer is played with a continuous clock that only stops for substitutions, injuries, or specific situations, while American football has a play clock that stops after each play.\n\nIn terms of popularity, both sports have a significant global following, but they tend to be more popular in different regions. Soccer, known as football outside of the United States, is the most popular sport in the world in terms of players, television audience, and overall popularity. It is particularly popular in Europe, Africa, and South America. American football, on the other hand, is the most popular sport in the United States, with the National Football League (NFL) being the top professional sports league in terms of average attendance and revenue. The Super Bowl, the NFL's championship game, is among the biggest club sporting events in the world in terms of TV viewership."}

The user seems to be seeking information about Herpes, so combining the two questions into one standalone question helps clarify the user's intent.", "agent_response": "Herpes is not generally considered a lethal disease. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can affect various parts of the body, such as the mouth (HSV-1) or genitals (HSV-2). The virus is transmitted through direct contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person. It can be contracted through skin-to-skin contact or exposure to infected saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, or the fluid from herpetic blisters. The virus can enter the body through tiny breaks in the skin or mucous membranes in the mouth or genital areas.\n\nIt is important to note that even asymptomatic carriers of the HSV-2 virus are still contagious, and many individuals may be unaware of their infection, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. In rare cases, herpes can cause severe complications, such as neonatal herpes in newborns, which can be a serious condition.

If a person has symptoms, they should avoid sexual contact until the symptoms have completely resolved. It is also important to note that even asymptomatic carriers of the virus can still transmit the infection to others. Therefore, taking precautions to prevent transmission, such as practicing safe sex and avoiding contact with active lesions or body fluids of an infected person, is crucial in preventing Herpes transmission."}

Generally, vaccines can be categorized into live-attenuated, killed, or subunit vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the virus that does not cause the disease but still confers immunity. These viruses are weakened through various methods, such as growing them under conditions that favor the selection of less virulent strains or using biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques to modify the virus's genes.\n\nKilled vaccines, on the other hand, use the entire inactivated virus, which cannot cause the disease but can still stimulate an immune response. The virus is killed using chemicals, heat, or radiation.\n\nSubunit vaccines, such as the hepatitis B vaccine, use only a specific part of the virus, such as the capsid proteins. These vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce these vaccines.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology is also used in vaccine development, where genetic material is artificially introduced into a host organism, producing a new set of genes or recombinant DNA. This technique is used to develop vaccines for various diseases, including viral infections."}

They have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Their activity is scattered randomly throughout the day, with no regular circadian patterns except for an avoidance of intense light.\n\nAfter their cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages."}

They can weigh between 1.5 to 3 pounds and have a lifespan of 4-8 years. Male guinea pigs (boars) are generally about 30% larger than female guinea pigs (sows). The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals have a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while male genitals have a penis that will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.\n\nDomesticated guinea pigs come in many breeds, which vary in hair and color composition. Common varieties found in pet stores include the English shorthair, Abyssinian, Peruvian, Sheltie (or Silkie), and Texel. Grooming needs vary depending on the breed, with shorthair breeds requiring weekly brushing and longhair breeds requiring daily grooming.\n\nGuinea pigs can survive in small quarters and were easily transported on ships to Europe, which contributes to their widespread popularity. They have a curious and inquisitive nature and are intelligent animals that enjoy interaction with their human caretakers."}

These breeds include the English shorthair, Abyssinian, Peruvian, Sheltie (or Silkie), and Texel, among others. These breeds vary in hair and color composition. The origin of guinea pigs is the Andean region of South America, where they were first domesticated as early as 5000 BC for food. They were later brought to Europe by Spanish, Dutch, and English traders, where they became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty. Guinea pigs that have been reintroduced into the wild may be identified as different species, but they are actually feral domesticated guinea pigs."}

The term \"guinea\" is harder to explain and has several proposed origins, such as being brought to Europe through Guinea, the use of \"Guinea\" to refer to any far-off country, a corruption of \"Guiana,\" or an alteration of the word \"coney\" (rabbit). The name in other languages also alludes to pigs, such as the German \"Meerschweinchen\" (little sea pig), French \"cochon d'Inde\" (Indian pig), and Dutch \"Guinees biggetje\" (Guinean piglet). The Japanese name \"morumotto\" is derived from the name of another rodent, the marmot."}

In some cases, it may be interconnected with slotted pipe to make a larger dry well system, discharge into man-made excavations known as recharge basins or retention ponds, or in cities with combined systems, it may go into large storage tanks or ponds for treatment after a heavy rain. However, generally, storm drains do not have treatment facilities in the piping system, so the water is not treated before it reaches its destination."}

It is typically designed with a sump, or reservoir, located immediately below the outlet where water overflows into the sewer proper. The size of the sump can vary and affects the overall performance of the catchbasin in removing sediment. Catchbasins are designed to retain storage available in the sump to capture sediment, and their effectiveness depends on routine maintenance.\n\nAdditionally, in the United Kingdom, catchbasins, also known as gully pots, are designed as true water-filled traps and can block the egress of gases and rodents.\n\nIn summary, a catchbasin is a storm drain component that captures sediment and objects, and its design includes a sump that varies in size and is subject to routine maintenance.

The first large-scale sewer systems in the United States were constructed in Chicago and Brooklyn in the late 1850s, but initially, these systems provided raw river water without any treatment. Only after John Snow established the link between contaminated water and disease in 1854 and after authorities became gradually convinced of that link, water treatment plants were added and public health improved. In the United States, the first reclaimed water facility for the reuse of treated wastewater in landscape irrigation was built in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, in 1932."}

The Soviet Union's entry into the war allowed the Allies to quickly overwhelm Japan, which was already weakened by previous fighting and economic embargoes.\n\nRegarding the two northern islands, Soviet forces took Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands as part of their territorial gains in the Far East. These territories had strategic value for the Soviet Union, as they provided year-round access to the Pacific Ocean and protected the Soviet Union's eastern flank.\n\nIt is important to note that Japan had previously invaded and occupied parts of the Soviet Far East during the 1920s and 1930s, and tensions between the two countries remained high throughout the interwar period. The Soviet Union's acquisition of these territories can be seen as a response to Japan's historical aggression and as a means of ensuring its own security in the region."}

Guinea pigs, also known as cuy or cuye, have been traditionally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. They are a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands, and are also consumed in some areas of Ecuador and Colombia. Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animals can be raised in an urban environment, making them a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs."}

This can be due to endocrine problems, drugs, radiation, or infection. There may also be testicular malformations, hormone imbalance, or blockage of the man's duct system. Some of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions, while others may be indefinite. Infertility associated with viable, but immotile sperm may be caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia. A defect in any of the sperm structures may result in infertility that will not be detected by semen analysis. Antisperm antibodies can also cause immune infertility. German scientists have reported that a virus called Adeno-associated virus might have a role in male infertility, though it is otherwise not harmful. Other diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause infertility due to internal scarring (fallopian tube obstruction).\n\nFor females, infertility can be caused by the inability to ovulate, malformation of the eggs, or issues with the system that produces eggs. Hormonal imbalance can also contribute to female infertility. The most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory problems, which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods. In humans, for a woman to conceive, vaginal intercourse must take place around the time when an egg is released from her ovary, the system that produces eggs has to be working at optimum levels, and her hormones must be balanced."}

From a purely economic standpoint, egg donation agencies do operate with a mindset of profit, as matches between egg recipients and donors are the source of their revenue. However, it's important to consider the ethical implications and potential health risks involved for the donors, especially when financial compensation may be the primary motivator for some donors. In the United States, egg donors are compensated regardless of the number of eggs they produce, and the compensation may increase with each additional donation, particularly if the donor's eggs have a history of resulting in pregnancies. This has led to some egg-broker agencies specifically targeting college students, who may be more likely to participate due to financial constraints. However, potential long-term health consequences should also be taken into account and considered when evaluating the profitability and ethics of the egg donation process as a business."}

Donors who work with agencies often appreciate the support and resources provided throughout the process, while recipients benefit from the efficiency and reduced risks associated with working with pre-screened donors.

The military was transformed from a rapid response, primarily defensive, citizen army into a professional, campaigning army, increasingly manned by mercenaries. As the threat of invasion receded, the need for maintaining large garrisons and expensive fortifications decreased, leading to a burgeoning treasury but also to inflation and a debased gold coinage. The army was seen as an unnecessary expense and a political threat, leading to the cashiering of native troops and their replacement by foreign mercenaries. Additionally, the Eastern Empire suffered from the attacks of the Arabs, who controlled Syria and the Levant and sent frequent raiding parties into Asia Minor. The Arab fleet laid siege to Constantinople in 674-678, which was repulsed through the use of Greek fire, but the raids continued and contributed to the demise of classical urban culture. The final blow came in 1453, when the Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottoman Empire."}

It was the first colony to instruct its delegates to vote for independence from the British Crown, which it did through the Halifax Resolves passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress on April 12, 1776. This event is commemorated on the state flag and seal. \n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, fierce guerrilla warfare erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. A major American victory in the war took place at King's Mountain along the North Carolina - South Carolina border. On October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina and southwest Virginia overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson. This victory prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories and gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence.\n\nHowever, the war also had a significant impact on the indigenous population. Early in July 1776, the Cherokee allies of Britain attacked the western frontier areas of North Carolina. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people and was directly responsible for the rise of the Chickamauga Cherokee, bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a frontier war for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.\n\nCongress appointed Horatio Gates, victor at Saratoga, to lead the American effort in the south. He suffered a major defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina. The British attempted to subjugate the countryside, and Patriot militia continued to fight against them. Cornwallis dispatched troops to raise Loyalist forces to cover his left flank as he moved north. This wing of Cornwallis' army was virtually destroyed on October 7, irreversibly breaking Loyalist support in the Carolinas.

It was the last state to declare secession from the Union, doing so on May 20, 1861, about two weeks after Tennessee's secession. Approximately 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military during the war, with 20,000 killed in battle and 21,000 dying of disease. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in Richmond, and the state saw only small battles.\n\nHowever, not all North Carolinians supported the Confederacy. Some yeoman farmers in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral, while some covertly supported the Union cause. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North. Numerous slaves also escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free.\n\nConfederate troops from North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865. In April 1865, after losing the Battle of Morrisville, Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place, in what is today Durham. North Carolina's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865, after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher, its major defense downriver.\n\nIn summary, North Carolina was a significant participant in the Civil War, providing a large number of troops for the Confederate Army and being the site of several important battles. However, not all North Carolinians supported the Confederacy, and a number of them served in the Union Army or escaped to Union lines. The state's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, and the war ended in North Carolina with the surrender of Confederate General Joseph Johnston to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman in April 1865."}

Traditionally, it has been dominated by small, local stores and street vendors, which still make up a significant portion of the market. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards more organized retail, with supermarkets and other large-scale retailers expanding their presence.\n\nIn 2008, retail supermarkets had a market share of 4%, but this is expected to grow in the coming years. The Indian government has taken steps to encourage the growth of organized retail, with policies such as allowing 51% FDI in multi-brand retail and 100% FDI in single-brand retail in 2012.\n\nHowever, there are still challenges to the growth of organized retail in India. One major issue is the lack of back-end warehouse infrastructure and state-level permits and red tape, which can make it difficult for retailers to operate efficiently. Additionally, compliance with numerous regulations such as \"signboard licenses\" and \"anti-hoarding measures\" is required before a store can open for business.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Indian retail market is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2020, making it one of the fastest-growing retail markets in the world. The retail industry is also a significant contributor to the Indian economy, with the sector contributing $482 billion (22% of GDP) and employing 249.94 million people (57% of the workforce) in 2016.\n\nChennai, in particular, is an important retail market in India, with several malls and a thriving retail industry.

It has two main functions for the body: (1) it is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis, generating approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, which include erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes; and (2) it is a key element of the lymphatic system, being one of the primary lymphoid organs that generate lymphocytes from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells. Additionally, bone marrow performs a valve-like function to prevent the backflow of lymphatic fluid in the lymphatic system."}

This can result from various conditions such as aplastic anemia, malignancies like multiple myeloma or leukemia, infections like tuberculosis, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, and sickle cell disease. Some of the symptoms associated with malfunctioning bone marrow include fatigue, weakness, frequent infections, and easy bruising or bleeding. In the case of sickle cell disease, the abnormally shaped red blood cells have a shorter lifespan, leading to anemia that cannot be compensated by the bone marrow's production rate.\n\nIn severe cases, bone marrow transplants may be conducted to treat some of these conditions. During a transplant, hematopoietic stem cells are removed from a compatible donor and infused into the patient. These infused cells travel to the bone marrow and initiate blood cell production, effectively replacing the patient's damaged bone marrow. Bone marrow transplants can be used to treat congenital defects, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and certain forms of cancer such as leukemia. Additionally, bone marrow stem cells have been successfully transformed into functional neural cells and have the potential to treat other illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease."}

Infection prevention: This includes vaccination and antibiotics to prevent severe bacterial infections, as well as high fluid intake.\n2. Folic acid supplementation: This helps the body produce new red blood cells.\n3. Pain medication: Different levels of pain can be managed with hydration, analgesics, blood transfusion, and opioid administration. For milder crises, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac or naproxen can be used.\n4. Blood transfusion: This can help increase the number of normal red blood cells in the body and decrease the percent of haemoglobin S.\n5. Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea): This medication helps stimulate the production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF), which can temporarily alleviate sickle cell disease symptoms.\n6. Gene therapy: As demonstrated in mice, gene therapy using a viral vector to make the body express production of fetal haemoglobin can be a more permanent way to increase therapeutic HbF production.\n\nIn cases of acute chest syndrome, simple blood transfusion or exchange transfusion is indicated if the pulmonary infiltrate worsens or the oxygen requirements increase. The patient should be admitted to the hospital with worsening A-a gradient an indication for ICU admission.\n\nRegular annual eye checks are also recommended for individuals with sickle cell disease to monitor for potential eye complications."}

It involves replacing the patient's damaged bone marrow with healthy hematopoietic stem cells from a compatible donor. This can help alleviate sickle cell disease symptoms by generating normal red blood cells. However, transplants are difficult to obtain due to the specific HLA typing necessary, and they carry the risk of graft versus host disease. Additionally, only 10% of people with sickle cell disease can find a suitable donor for umbilical cord blood transplant.

Despite the immediate failure of the movement, the British government realized that India was ungovernable in the long run due to the cost of World War II, and the question for postwar became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.

They are known for their pre-Roman societies, which were linked to a network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeological evidence suggests that they had an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade and contained valuable resources such as tin, lead, iron, silver, and gold. Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewelry for international trade, particularly with the Romans.\n\nThere are different theories regarding the origin and spread of the Celtic language and culture. While some believe that they spread through large-scale invasions, others argue that they spread through contact rather than invasion. The documents mention that there is archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, but not in some of the other areas.\n\nAdditionally, the documents suggest that there was a more recent approach that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La T\u00e8ne culture were rare in these areas, and it is considered equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Peninsular Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture.\n\nFurthermore, there are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies, with thousands employed between 283-246 BC and also in service around 186 BC.

However, several reasons have been given for this practice. The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered, based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who broke a vessel to calm down exuberant wedding celebrations. Another common explanation is that it serves as a reminder that Jews still mourn the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Some people recite the verses \"If I forget thee / O Jerusalem ... \" (Ps. 137 : 5) during this part of the ceremony.\n\nThe former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Ovadia Yosef, criticized the way this custom is sometimes carried out, emphasizing that it should express sorrow over Jerusalem's destruction instead of becoming an occasion for lightheartedness.\n\nIn Reform Judaism, there is a new custom where brides and grooms break the wine glass together. This practice is part of the common features of a Jewish wedding, which also includes a ketubah (marriage contract), a wedding canopy (chuppah or huppah), a ring owned by the groom given to the bride under the canopy, and the breaking of a glass."}

During the Industrial Revolution, it became a major location for production due to its ability to facilitate fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast. Hundreds of factories were built around the Hudson, and the river was linked to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes, allowing manufacturing in the Midwest to use the river for transport. The Hudson was also the site of the first commercially successful steamboat, the North River Steamboat (later known as Clermont), which began operating in 1807.\n\nAdditionally, the Hudson is a tidal estuary, which means it is partially open to the sea and subject to tides. The lower Hudson experiences strong tides, making parts of New York Harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate. Ice floes may also drift south or north depending on the tides during the winter.\n\nFurthermore, the Hudson River and its tributaries, notably the Mohawk River, drain a large area. Parts of the Hudson River form coves, such as Weehawken Cove in the towns of Hoboken and Weehawken in New Jersey."}

Cummings, whose full name was Edward Estlin Cummings, was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 14, 1894, and died in North Conway, New Hampshire, on September 3, 1962.\n\nCummings is best known for his poetry, which is characterized by its unconventional use of grammar, punctuation, and word order. He often used lowercase letters and unorthodox formatting to create visual and rhythmic effects in his poems.\n\nCummings' first published work of poetry was a collection titled Tulips and Chimneys, which was published in 1923. This collection marked the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nIn addition to his poetry, Cummings also wrote two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.

Cummings's life was marked by his passion for poetry, which began in his childhood and continued throughout his adult life. He graduated from Harvard University and developed an interest in modern poetry, which ignored conventional grammar and syntax. His poetry often explores themes of love, nature, and the relationship between the individual and society, and is known for its unconventional style, including unusual word order, unorthodox typography, and punctuation.\n\nHis father's death had a significant impact on Cummings, leading him to focus on more profound aspects of life in his poetry. His famous poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\" is a tribute to his father.\n\nCummings's visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and surrealism, which influenced his later work. His later poetry became more lucid, moving, and profound, as he began to rely on symbolism and allegory instead of simile and metaphor. He also incorporated imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nTherefore, Cummings's life and experiences significantly influenced his poetry, and his famous poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\" was affected by the profound impact of his father's death on his life and artistic expression."}

However, the basic concept of a cotton gin existed in the Indian subcontinent since the 13th-14th centuries, in the form of the worm gear roller gin. This traditional cotton gin is still in use in the Indian subcontinent today. Eli Whitney's cotton gin, which used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint, revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States. Modern automated cotton gins are also used today, offering higher productivity than their hand-powered forebears."}

While the gin made the process of separating cotton fibers from their seeds much faster and more efficient, it also significantly increased the demand for raw cotton due to the growing textile industry. This increased demand was met by expanding cotton cultivation, particularly in the Southern United States, which in turn required more labor to grow and harvest the crop. The institution of slavery became even more deeply ingrained in the South's economy as a result."}

By revolutionizing the cotton industry and significantly increasing the demand for raw cotton, the cotton gin contributed to the growth of slavery in the American South. This heightened dependency on slave labor and the South's plantation-based agriculture economy created tensions that were already present due to regional differences and disagreements over states' rights.
