The Galileo spacecraft discovered that lightning storms, which are common near Jupiter's equator, drop softball-sized hailstones of ammonia and water. On the other hand, the Juno spacecraft provided the first clear, close-up pictures of Jupiter's north pole, revealing a strange, bluish region full of giant storms and strange weather. There is a central cyclone at the north pole surrounded by eight more, and during a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. Additionally, Juno's extended mission includes monitoring the moon Io, which has volcanically active regions, leading to the appearance of fresh lava fields that might be associated with cyclones."}

Warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface, creating an area of lower air pressure below. Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure then pushes in to the low pressure area, warms up, and rises as well, causing the surrounding air to swirl in. As the warm, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds, and the whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fueled by the ocean's heat and evaporating water. Storms that form north of the equator spin counterclockwise, while those south of the equator spin clockwise due to Earth's rotation. As the storm system rotates faster and faster, an eye forms in the center, characterized by calm and clear weather and very low air pressure."}

While the government can implement floodplain management strategies, restrict development in high-risk areas, and provide flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), it cannot ultimately prevent people from choosing to live in these areas.\n\nThe NFIP aims to reduce flood risk by providing flood insurance and encouraging communities to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations. However, the choice to live in flood-prone areas ultimately resides with individual property owners.\n\nIn some cases, people may not be fully aware of the risks associated with living in a floodplain or may believe that they can effectively manage the risk through various means, such as purchasing insurance, elevating their homes, or implementing flood-resistant construction techniques.\n\nMoreover, floodplain areas often offer unique environmental, economic, and social benefits that can make them attractive places to live. For example, floodplains can provide valuable habitat for wildlife, support agriculture and other land uses, and offer scenic views and recreational opportunities.\n\nIn summary, while the government can implement floodplain management strategies and provide resources to help individuals and communities manage flood risk, it cannot ultimately prevent people from living in flood-prone areas due to a combination of historical, personal, and economic factors."}

If you have any concerns about the vaccine or experience severe side effects, contact your healthcare provider.\n\nHere is the supporting evidence from the documents:\n\n1. \"All COVID-19 vaccines in the United States are authorized for emergency use or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been thoroughly tested and found to be safe and effective in preventing severe COVID-19.\"\n2. \"After a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized by the FDA, many vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events (possible side effects). This ongoing monitoring can pick up on adverse events that may not have been seen in clinical trials.\"\n3. \"Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines under the most intense safety monitoring in U.S. history.\"\n4. \"You may have some side effects after you get a COVID-19 vaccine. These are normal signs that your body is building protection against COVID-19. Most people have mild side effects or no side effects at all.\"\n5. \"Some people have reported severe allergic reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine. When you get a COVID-19 vaccine at VA, we may closely monitor your reaction for either 15 or 30 minutes after your vaccine.\""}

This response helps our bodies to recognize and fight the virus if we are exposed to it in the future. The two main types of COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) and viral vector vaccines (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen).\n\nmRNA vaccines contain a small piece of the virus's mRNA, which our cells use to produce a harmless piece of the virus. Our bodies then recognize this piece as foreign and create an immune response. The mRNA is quickly broken down and eliminated by our bodies, and it does not affect our DNA.\n\nViral vector vaccines, on the other hand, use a harmless virus to deliver a small piece of the virus's DNA into our cells. Our cells then use this DNA to produce a harmless piece of the virus, which triggers an immune response. The viral vector is not harmful and does not replicate, but it helps to teach our bodies how to recognize and fight the virus.\n\nBoth types of vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. According to the New York State Department of Health, the effectiveness of the FDA-approved and -authorized vaccines remains strong even against newer strains, including against variants. Those who are unvaccinated have the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill, which is why it is important to get vaccinated as soon as possible."}

When volcanoes erupt, they can emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, water, and sulfur dioxide, which can impact the climate. Sulfur dioxide, in particular, can react with other substances to produce sulfate aerosol, which can scatter light and cool the global climate for a couple of years following a major eruption.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes is relatively small compared to human emissions. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release approximately 100 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year than volcanoes.\n\nWhile natural influences on temperature, such as volcanic eruptions, have varied approximately plus or minus 0.2\u00b0 C (0.4\u00b0 F) in the past 120 years, human influences have contributed roughly 0.8\u00b0 C (1\u00b0 F) of warming since 1889.

Here are some general steps for creating and scripting sprites in Scratch:\n\n1. Create a new sprite by selecting the \"Choose a sprite\" option in the sprite list and choosing the desired image.\n2. Switch to the \"Scripts\" tab to start programming the sprite's behavior.\n3. Use the available blocks to create scripts that control the sprite's movements, appearances, and interactions with other sprites and the backdrop.\n\nFor example, to make the rover sprite move up, down, left, and right on the screen, you can use the arrow key blocks in the \"Events\" and \"Motion\" categories to create a script that detects key presses and moves the sprite accordingly. You can also use the \"Control\" category blocks to make the sample tube sprites disappear when they are visited by the rover, and to make them reappear when players click the green flag to restart the game.\n\nNote that the specific blocks and scripts you will need to use will depend on the behavior and features you want to implement in your game.

According to the documents you provided, the sources of light pollution that can affect skywatching include parking lots, sport complexes, street lights, and other human activity. This scattered light is then sent into the night sky, creating a glow that can make it difficult to observe fainter stars and the Milky Way.

The spacecraft is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple debris shield mounted on one side. It has one high- and one medium-resolution instrument, each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer. The medium resolution camera has a field of view of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at 700 km distance, while the high resolution camera has a field of view of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km. Power is provided by a 7.2 square meter solar array and stored in a small NiH2 battery. The spacecraft control system consists of four hemispherical resonator gyros, two star trackers, reaction wheels, and hydrazine thrusters. Thermal control is achieved by insulating blankets, surface radiators, finishes, and heaters. The spacecraft has two redundant RAD750 computers with 309 MB each of memory for scientific data.\n\nThe impactor projectile is made of primarily copper (49%) and only 24% aluminum. It has a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting which can provide delta-V of 25 m/s. Targeting is accomplished using a high-precision star-tracker, auto-navigation algorithms, and the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), a camera which provides images for autonomous control and targeting.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched on 12 January 2005 at 18:47:08.574 UT (1:47:08 p.m. EST) on a Delta II and transferred into a heliocentric orbit. It will rendezvous with comet P/Tempel 1 in July 2005.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the following link:\n<http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2005-001D>"}

The mission involved sending a spacecraft to rendezvous with the comet and launching a projectile into its nucleus to observe the ejecta and crater formation process.\n\nThe spacecraft consisted of a flyby bus and a cylindrical copper impactor, and was equipped with high- and medium-resolution imaging cameras and infrared spectrometers to observe the ejected ice and dust. The impactor was made primarily of copper and had a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting.\n\nThe mission's scientific objectives were to improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus, determine properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the crater and its formation, study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact, and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched on January 12, 2005, and successfully observed the comet Tempel 1 in July of the same year. During the encounter, the spacecraft reoriented itself to protect against dust damage, and then returned images and data to Earth. The mission ended in August 2005, with a total budget of $240 million.\n\nThe Deep Impact mission was followed by an extended mission called EPOXI, which involved flying by comet Hartley 2 and observing nearby bright stars with known large planets to characterize their planets. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on November 4, 2010, and the extended mission ended in July 2008."}

Comets are icy bodies that originate from the outer regions of the solar system. When they come close to the Sun, they heat up and begin to emit gas and dust, creating a glowing coma and sometimes also a tail. Comets are important objects of study in astronomy because they are thought to contain some of the most primitive material in the solar system, and therefore can provide clues about the conditions that existed when the Sun and planets formed.\n\nSome comets have short-period orbits, meaning they orbit the Sun with periods of less than 200 years, while others have long-period orbits and may take thousands of years to complete a single orbit. Comet Tempel 1, which was the target of the Deep Impact mission, is an example of a short-period comet, with an orbital period of 5.5 years. Comet Hartley 2, on the other hand, has an orbital period of 6.5 years and was the target of the EPOXI mission.\n\nComets can also provide information about the structure and evolution of the solar system. For example, by studying the orbits of comets, astronomers can learn about the distribution of mass in the outer solar system and the history of the planetary migration. By analyzing the composition of cometary material, scientists can also learn about the chemical processes that occurred during the formation of the solar system.\n\nOverall, the study of comets is an important area of research in astronomy and space science, with potential to shed light on the origins and evolution of the solar system."}

Closed bins are recommended to keep critters out and to maintain the presence of beneficial microbes needed for decomposition. If you make your own closed bin, drill holes for oxygen exchange.\n\nStep 2: Gather Materials - Collect materials to compost and categorize them as 'browns' (higher in carbon) or 'greens' (higher in nitrogen). A common ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Examples of brown materials include leaves, straw, wood chips, and cardboard. Greens include vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and grass clippings. Avoid materials like feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, and non-organic matter.\n\nStep 3: Maintain - If you have an open bin, layer small sticks and twigs at the bottom for air and drainage. Layer browns and greens, with greens in the middle and more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, and turn it to encourage decomposition and oxygen presence.\n\nStep 4: Harvest and More! - When the compost has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil, it is ready. If you don't fully turn the pile, the finished compost will be at the bottom. If you run out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel and toilet paper rolls can be used as additions.\n\nAdditional resources for composting at home can be found at www.compost.css.cornell.edu, www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home, and www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8799.html.\n\nFor more information on composting methods, you can refer to the US EPA's Approaches to Composting document.

Don't cut switchbacks.\n4. Pack out at least as much as you pack in.\n5. Control Your Bicycle: obey all bicycle speed regulations and recommendations, and ride within your limits.\n6. Yield Appropriately: let your fellow trail users know you're coming - a friendly greeting or bell ring are good methods. Try to anticipate other trail users as you ride around corners. Bicyclists should yield to other non-motorized trail users, unless the trail is clearly signed for bike-only travel. Bicyclists traveling downhill should yield to ones headed uphill, unless the trail is clearly signed for one-way or downhill-only traffic.\n7. In general, strive to respect everyone you meet on the trail.\n8. Never Scare Animals: respect wildlife and wildlife habitat. Animals are easily startled by an unannounced approach, a sudden movement or a loud noise. Give animals enough room and time to adjust to you. When passing horses, use special care and follow directions from the horseback riders (ask if uncertain).\n9. Plan Ahead: know your equipment, your ability and the area in which you are riding and prepare accordingly. Strive to be self-sufficient: keep your equipment in good repair. Carry necessary supplies for changes in weather or other conditions. Always wear a helmet and appropriate safety gear.\n10. Prevent the Spread of Invasive Species: invasive plants and seeds can be moved from one place to another on clothing and in tire treads. Learn how to prevent the spread of invasive species.\n\nAdditionally, the New York Bicycling Coalition advocates for pro-bicycle and pro-pedestrian policies and funding at all levels of government, educates New Yorkers about bicycle safety and the benefits of bicycling, and promotes bicycle tourism across the state."}

You can file in person at the Civil Unit located at 720 9th Street in Room 102, or you can file by mail. If you are filing a Domestic Violence or Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Restraining Order, you do not need to make copies before filing, as the court will provide them to you once the judge makes a decision. If you need to file against more than one person, you must use a separate packet for each person. If you need to include family members or others on the restraining order, it will be up to a Judge to decide. To file against a roommate, you can use a Domestic Violence Restraining Order if you have a close relationship with them, or a Civil Harassment Restraining Order if your relationship is not close."}

According to the document, a Civil Harassment Restraining Order is a court order that can protect you from someone who has harassed, stalked, threatened, or abused you. It can include orders such as no contact, staying away by a certain distance, not owning or having firearms or ammunition, and not harassing, stalking, threatening, or harming people protected by the order.\n\nTo get a Civil Harassment Restraining Order in California, you will need to complete a few court forms and describe in detail the harassment, stalking, threats, or harm you experienced. If you need help with these forms, you can contact your local Self-Help Center. Once you turn in your forms, a judge will make a decision that same day or by the next business day on whether to give you temporary protection.\n\nIt is important to note that a Civil Harassment Restraining Order can only be granted against someone you are not closely related to or have not had an intimate relationship with, such as a neighbor, a landlord, or a co-worker. If you need a restraining order against someone you've dated or had an intimate relationship with, or a relative like a child, parent, or sibling, there are other types of restraining orders you can request.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
