For instance, it provided the first clear, close-up pictures of Jupiter's north pole, revealing a region full of giant storms and strange weather. A central cyclone at the north pole is surrounded by eight more, all smacking together yet not merging, with each storm stretching more than 2,500 miles across. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone that had somehow muscled into a pattern of six cyclones, which had previously seemed locked in place.\n\nAfter entering Jupiter's orbit, Juno made several more discoveries. It found that Jupiter's magnetic field is far more intense than expected, with some places being more than 30 times as powerful as the one surrounding Earth. Juno also solved a mystery about the low water content near Jupiter's equator that the Galileo spacecraft had found. It showed that water is much more abundant nearer Jupiter's equator.\n\nJuno also discovered that high-voltage electrical charges contribute to the formation of auroras at Jupiter's poles, with the most powerful energies reaching 400,000 electron volts, significantly more than the few thousand volts of our most powerful auroras on Earth.\n\nIn addition, Juno found that Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a signature cyclone, is slowly shrinking, from twice Earth's size in 1979 to 1.3 times its current size. Juno plumbed the depths of this cyclone, showing that its roots run 200 miles deep.\n\nSince April 2022, Juno has been observing the volcano-covered moon Io and has sent back images that appear to show fresh lava fields, in areas last seen in visible-light images during Galileo and New Horizon flybys.\n\nPlease note that these are just a few of Juno's discoveries, and the spacecraft continues to provide new insights into Jupiter and its moons."}

Here are some of them:\n\n1. Evidence for a saltwater ocean beneath the icy surface of the Jovian moon Europa. This discovery has significant implications for the search for life beyond Earth, as such an ocean could potentially harbor extraterrestrial organisms.\n2. Extensive volcanic processes on the moon Io, which has the highest volcanic activity in the solar system. Galileo's observations helped scientists understand the mechanics of Io's volcanism and its impact on the Jovian system.\n3. A magnetic field generated by the moon Ganymede, which made it the first moon known to generate its own magnetic field. This discovery has implications for our understanding of the geological and magnetic processes at work in moons and planets.\n4. Discovering the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n5. Conducting long-term observations of the Jovian system, including direct measurements of Jupiter's atmosphere with a descent probe.\n\nThese discoveries have significantly advanced our knowledge of Jupiter, its moons, and the broader solar system. The Juno spacecraft, which is currently exploring Jupiter, is building on the legacy of the Galileo mission and making new discoveries of its own."}

The process begins when the warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface, creating an area of lower air pressure below. Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure then pushes in to the low pressure area, warms up, and rises as well. This continuous rising motion causes the surrounding air to swirl in, forming clouds and a system of clouds and wind that spins and grows, fed by the ocean's heat and water evaporating from the surface. Storms that form north of the equator spin counterclockwise, while those south of the equator spin clockwise due to Earth's rotation. As the storm system rotates faster and faster, an eye forms in the center, marking the calm and clear area with very low air pressure."}

Jupiter is approximately 365 million miles from the Earth on average, which is about 4,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. The storms on Jupiter are also vastly different from those on Earth, being composed of different materials and conditions, so they do not pose the same kind of hazards as cyclones on Earth, which can cause destruction due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. The cyclones on Jupiter are primarily of scientific interest, as they help us understand the planet's atmospheric dynamics and composition."}

Exposure to artificial light at night can disrupt the body's natural circadian rhythms, leading to sleep disruptions, increased risk of certain cancers, and other health problems. This is because light pollution can suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles.\n\nThe document from the California Air Resources Board states that air pollution, including light pollution, can have significant negative impacts on public health. Exposure to polluted air is linked to a number of health effects, including worsened asthma, hospitalizations, and even premature death related to heart and lung disease. Toxic air pollutants emitted from cars, trucks and industry can also cause cancer.\n\nThe NASA Earth Observatory article highlights a new satellite-derived dataset linking concentrations of fine particulate matter in air pollution with health outcomes in cities around the world. While this specifically focuses on particulate matter, it is worth noting that light pollution is also a form of air pollution that can have negative effects on health.\n\nIn summary, both air pollution and light pollution can have negative impacts on health. It is important to take steps to reduce exposure to both, such as limiting the use of artificial lights at night and reducing the use of fossil fuels that contribute to air pollution."}

First, you should never look directly at the Sun without appropriate protection, as this can cause serious eye damage or blindness. Instead, there are several safe methods to view a solar eclipse, such as using special eclipse glasses, a pinhole projector, or a welder's helmet with a shade number of 12 or higher.\n\nA pinhole projector is a simple device that projects an image of the Sun, allowing you to safely observe the eclipse indirectly. To create a pinhole projector, you can follow instructions from NASA's Space Place, which involves cutting a small hole in a piece of cardstock, taping aluminum foil over the hole, and poking a pin-sized hole in the foil. You can then project the Sun's image onto another piece of cardstock or a white surface, like a wall or the ground. NASA also recommends standing with the Sun behind you and using a shadowed area to view the projection for a clearer image.\n\nFor capturing photos of a solar eclipse, it is important to protect your camera with a special solar filter, just as you would protect your eyes. However, during totality, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun, you can remove the filter to photograph the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona. Using a tripod and a delayed shutter release timer can help stabilize the camera and avoid taking blurry images when there is low lighting.\n\nAdditionally, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory provides educational resources about eclipses, including lesson plans and activities to expand student learning around the eclipse and related astrophysics concepts."}

The pinhole projects a small image of the eclipsed object (Sun or Moon) onto a separate surface, such as a piece of cardstock or a white wall. This method prevents you from directly exposing your eyes to the potentially harmful light of the Sun or the Moon, reducing the risk of eye damage.\n\nIn the case of a solar eclipse, looking directly at the Sun can result in serious eye damage or blindness, so using a pinhole projector or other appropriate protective measures is crucial. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon appears dimmer and is generally safer to look at directly. However, creating a pinhole projector for a lunar eclipse can still be a fun and educational way to observe the event, especially if you want to share the experience with others or observe the eclipse's progression over time."}

By projecting the image of the eclipse onto a separate surface, you avoid looking directly at the Sun or the Moon, minimizing any risk of eye damage. Additionally, NASA and other reputable organizations provide guidelines and instructions for creating and using pinhole projectors, ensuring that you have accurate and reliable information.\n\nIf you'd like, you can practice making a pinhole projector and testing it with a bright light source before the actual eclipse. This can help familiarize you with the process and alleviate any concerns you might have. Remember, millions of people around the world safely observe eclipses through various methods, including pinhole projectors, and you can do so too."}

She is the first woman of color to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. With decades of experience and a long record of achievements, she is a powerful, effective attorney and lifelong public servant.\n\nLetitia James focused on protecting vulnerable New York residents and ensuring that individuals or companies that broke state laws were held accountable in her first term. She secured more than $7.5 billion for New York from those who broke state laws and took advantage of New Yorkers, including more than $2.5 billion from opioid manufacturers and distributors for their roles in the opioid epidemic. Under her leadership, the Office of the New York State Attorney General helped remove more than 4,000 guns from New York communities, took down dozens of dangerous drug and gun trafficking rings throughout the state, and took legal action to stop the proliferation of ghost guns.\n\nAdditionally, Letitia James took on predatory landlords who harassed tenants and endangered children by violating New York's lead paint laws. She protected New Yorkers\u2019 health and the state's natural resources by going after polluters and companies that flouted environmental protection laws. Letitia James also stood up for vulnerable populations by going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop a question about citizenship from being added to the census and successfully protecting DACA. She has been a national leader in the fight to defend access to reproductive health care, leading dozens of legal actions across the country to protect and expand access to this lifesaving care.\n\nBefore serving as Attorney General, Letitia James was the public advocate for the City of New York, the first woman of color to hold citywide office. During her tenure as public advocate, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap. Prior to serving as public advocate, Letitia James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for 10 years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that forced landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York"}

Familiarize yourself with the whistleblower laws in your state. For example, in California, you are protected from retaliation by your employer for disclosing information about violations of state or federal statutes, rules, or regulations (California Labor Code Section 1102.5(b)).\n\n2. Consider reporting the issue internally first, if your company has established procedures for handling whistleblower claims. Review these procedures to figure out how to proceed.\n\n3. If you decide to report externally, make sure to have enough information to support your claims of supposed improper or unlawful behavior.\n\n4. Keep your identity confidential or anonymous, if possible. For instance, if you're reporting to the Public Utilities Commission, they will keep your identity private if you ask to remain anonymous.\n\n5. Consult with a lawyer, especially if you fear retaliation. You may have to dedicate personal time and money to hire an attorney to file a lawsuit for retaliation.\n\n6. Be cautious about breaking confidentiality or revealing privileged information, as this could put you at risk of retaliation. California law, for example, does not protect disclosures made by private-sector whistleblowers that reveal a trade secret.\n\n7. Document everything, including the timeline of events, people involved, and any evidence you have.\n\n8. Seek support from whistleblower organizations, colleagues, or friends and family.\n\nRemember, even with these protections, there is still a risk of retaliation. It's important to take precautions to protect yourself."}

Decide when it's best to hire a lawyer. This may include having a complicated case, the other side having a lawyer, wanting legal advice, wanting a confidential attorney-client relationship, discussing strategies for your case, negotiating with the other side, worrying about the other side not playing fair, having a jury trial, or being too close emotionally to the case.\n2. Find a lawyer. You can find a lawyer through a lawyer referral service, your local county bar association, LawhelpCalifornia.org, the State Bar's Lawyer Referral Services Directory, by searching for a State Bar-certified specialist, or by asking for referrals from friends, co-workers, employers, or other lawyers.\n3. Check the lawyer's background. Review the lawyer's background and discipline record at the State Bar\u2019s web page on Attorney Search and check that the lawyer is in good standing with the State Bar.\n4. Interview the lawyer. Ask them questions about their experience, the possible outcomes of your case, how long it may take, the costs, and how they will keep you informed as the case progresses.\n5. Understand the lawyer's explanation of what your case involves and make sure the fee seems reasonable.\n6. If you decide to hire the lawyer, make sure you understand the agreement before you sign it. If you are not comfortable with any of the terms, do not sign it. And if you cannot work out your disagreement, you may want to find a new lawyer.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to understand the different ways that lawyers bill, including fixed fee, hourly fee, retainer fee, contingency fee, and statutory fee. You will also be responsible for paying the costs of your case, such as filing fees, copying expenses, and expert fees. It is a good idea to ask the lawyer for a written estimate of what the costs will be.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about your case, first talk to your lawyer. If you are having serious problems with your lawyer and have been unable to resolve them, there are other things you can do, including getting information from the State Bar."}

In California, spousal support can be temporary or permanent and is determined based on a variety of factors, including the length of the marriage, the income and earning capacity of each spouse, and the standard of living established during the marriage.\n\nIn the context of a divorce, a request for spousal support can be made through a Request for Order (RFO), which is a legal document filed with the court. If the spouses are able to agree on the terms of spousal support, they can submit a stipulated judgment to the court which outlines their agreements on property division, spousal support, child support, and child custody and visitation.\n\nIt is important to note that spousal support is not automatically granted in a divorce, and the court has discretion in determining the amount and duration of support payments. If one spouse disagrees with the court's decision on spousal support, they may have grounds to appeal the decision.\n\nIf you have any further questions about spousal support or the divorce process in California, I recommend consulting with a family law attorney or visiting the California Courts Self Help Guide for more information."}

The spacecraft is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach. There are two high-resolution and medium-resolution instruments attached to the framework, each consisting of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer. The medium resolution camera has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at 700 km distance, while the high resolution camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km. The power of 620 W at the encounter is provided by a 7.2 square meter solar array and stored in a small NiH2 battery. The spacecraft control system consists of four hemispherical resonator gyros, two star trackers, reaction wheels, and hydrazine thrusters. Thermal control is achieved by insulating blankets, surface radiators, finishes, and heaters. The spacecraft has two redundant RAD750 computers with 309 MB each of memory for scientific data.\n\nThe impactor projectile is made of primarily copper (49%) and only 24% aluminum so it will be easily identifiable and minimize contamination in the spectra after the projectile is largely vaporized and mixed in with the comet ejecta on impact. The impactor is a short hexagonal cylinder built above the copper cratering mass. It has a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting which can provide delta-V of 25 m/s. Targeting is accomplished using a high-precision star-tracker, auto-navigation algorithms, and the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), a camera which provides images for autonomous control and targeting. The ITS will operate until impact, and images will be sent back to Earth via the flyby spacecraft. Communication with the flyby spacecraft is via S-band. The impactor is mechanically and electrically connected to the flyby spacecraft until 24 hours prior to encounter. After separation it runs on internal battery power."}

The Deep Impact mission was designed to study comet 9P/Tempel 1, but during the extended mission, it also flew by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010. Comets are icy bodies that originate from the distant outer regions of the solar system. When they come close to the Sun, they heat up and release gas and dust, creating a glowing coma and often a tail, making them visible from Earth.\n\nComet 9P/Tempel 1 has an estimated size of roughly 14 km long and 4 km wide. It follows an orbit with a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) of 1.5 AU (about 225 million kilometers) and an aphelion (farthest point from the Sun) of 5.2 AU (about 780 million kilometers). Its orbital period is around 6.6 years.\n\nComet 103P/Hartley 2, on the other hand, is a smaller comet, with an elongated nucleus about 2 km long by 0.5 km wide. This comet has a shorter orbital period of 6.46 years, and its perihelion is at 1.05 AU (about 157 million kilometers). Comet 103P/Hartley 2 is known for its high level of activity and is classified as a hyperactive comet.\n\nThe Deep Impact mission's primary goal was to study comet 9P/Tempel 1, but during the EPOXI extended mission, it also contributed to our understanding of comet 103P/Hartley 2."}

Based on the information from the Madison County, NY backyard composting guide, here are the four steps to composting at home:\n\n1. **Pick Out A Bin:** Your compost bin should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size and located in a convenient, accessible area. You can use a closed bin, like a tumbler, to keep critters out and ensure that microbes, which help break down waste, are present. If you make your own closed bin, drill holes to allow oxygen exchange. Pallets make great open compost bins if you can get a hold of them.\n\n2. **Gather Materials:** Materials for composting can be divided into two categories: \"browns\" and \"greens.\" Browns are higher in carbon and include leaves, straw, wood chips, and cardboard. Greens are higher in nitrogen and include vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, grass clippings, and manure from herbivores. Aim for a ratio of 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Do not include feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter.\n\n3. **Maintain:** Layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom of your bin for air and drainage. Then, layer your browns and greens, with greens in the middle and more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung-out sponge. Turning the pile helps break it down faster and ensures oxygen is present.\n\n4. **Harvest and More!:** Your compost is ready when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. You may need to fully turn the pile to access all of the finished compost. If you run out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel rolls, and toilet paper rolls make good additions.\n\nRemember, composting at home can reduce your waste, save money, and provide nutrient-rich soil for gardening!"}

Beneficial microorganisms in a compost pile require a temperature range of 131 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal activity. This range promotes rapid decomposition and destroys pathogens and weed seeds. Pile temperatures must remain at 131 degrees Fahrenheit or above for several days to meet standards for reducing pathogens. The exact amount of time depends on the method of composting. Controlling the oxygen, moisture, pile structure, and nutrient balance helps achieve the optimal temperature range in a compost pile."}

Mediation can be particularly useful when parties have a relationship they want to preserve, such as family members, neighbors, or business partners. However, it may not be appropriate in cases involving crimes, abuse, or significant power imbalances. Small Claims mediation is confidential, meaning that any communication during the mediation process cannot be used in any later court proceeding. Mediation can take place before or after a Small Claims case has been filed, and if an agreement is reached at the mediation, it can be entered into the court record without having to appear in court.
