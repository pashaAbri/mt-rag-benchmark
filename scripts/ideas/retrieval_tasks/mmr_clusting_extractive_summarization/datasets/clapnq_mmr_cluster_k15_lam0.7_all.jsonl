In soccer, the ball is mostly moved around by being kicked, and only two players on the field, the goalkeepers, can use their hands. The aim is to kick or head the ball into the opposing team's goal. On the other hand, American football is played with an oval-shaped ball, and players can use their hands to run, pass, or catch the ball. The offense, which has possession of the ball, tries to advance down the field and score by either running the ball into the end zone for a touchdown or kicking it through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The defense aims to stop the offense's advance and take control of the ball for themselves.\n\nAnother notable difference is the field dimensions. In soccer, the field is typically larger and has no specific dimensions, while American football is played on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. Soccer games consist of two 45-minute halves with additional stoppage time, while American football games are divided into four 15-minute quarters with breaks in between.\n\nLastly, the scoring systems are different. In soccer, a goal is worth one point, and the team with the most goals at the end of the game wins. In American football, touchdowns are worth six points, field goals are worth three points, and safeties (bringing the ball down in the opposing team's end zone) are worth two points. Teams can also score extra points after touchdowns, with one or two additional points available depending on the play."}

Initially, they would jump the barbed wire or leap out of apartment windows along the line. However, as the Wall was fortified, these methods became less feasible. East German authorities no longer allowed apartments near the Wall to be occupied, and any building near the Wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up.\n\nDespite these measures, people continued to find ways to escape. Some dug long tunnels under the Wall, waited for favorable winds and took a hot air balloon, slid along aerial wires, flew ultralights, or drove cars at full speed through the basic fortifications. In one instance, a car was modified to allow the roof and windscreen to come away when it made contact with a metal beam placed at checkpoints, enabling up to four people to drive under the bar and lay flat to keep moving forward.\n\nAdditionally, some escaped through the sewers, with assistance from the Unternehmen Reiseb\u00fcro in some cases. The sewer system predated the Wall, and its existence provided an opportunity for escape. The East Germans attempted to counteract this by building zig-zagging roads at checkpoints.\n\nAs the wave of refugees increased, people found their way to Hungary via Czechoslovakia or through the West German Embassy in Prague. This exodus of emigrants posed potential benefits for smuggling East German secret agents to West Germany and reducing the number of citizens hostile to the communist regime, but these advantages proved to be of minor use."}

The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual, even when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes can also be transmitted to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses reside in the body for life and can cause recurrent outbreaks, which may be triggered by factors such as decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. The diagnosis of oral and genital herpes is usually based on the presenting symptoms and can be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters.

Here are the three main types of vaccines and how they are typically made:\n\n1. Live-attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus or bacteria that cause the disease. They are typically made by growing the virus or bacteria in culture, then reducing its virulence (or ability to cause disease) through various methods, such as exposure to chemicals or radiation. Examples of live-attenuated vaccines include the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.\n2. Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain viruses or bacteria that have been killed or inactivated so that they can no longer cause disease. They are typically made by growing the virus or bacteria in culture, then killing or inactivating it using chemicals, heat, or radiation. Examples of inactivated vaccines include the polio vaccine and the hepatitis A vaccine.\n3. Subunit vaccines: These vaccines contain only the specific components of the virus or bacteria that are responsible for triggering an immune response. They are typically made using biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques, which allow scientists to isolate and produce specific viral or bacterial proteins. Examples of subunit vaccines include the hepatitis B vaccine and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific methods used to produce vaccines can vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific vaccine.

Regarding their activity, domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts. They have longer periods of activity scattered randomly throughout the day, with no regular circadian patterns apparent, aside from an avoidance of intense light. After their cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages.\n\nPlease note that the document does not provide information about the specific types of shelters or burrows that domestic guinea pigs may create or prefer in a home setting."}

They do not have a visible tail. The position of the anus is close to the genitals in both male and female guinea pigs. Female genitals have a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while male genitals have a similar shape but the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding area. Male guinea pigs also have visible testes due to scrotal swelling. Domesticated guinea pigs come in various breeds, including the English shorthair (also known as the American), Abyssinian, Peruvian, Sheltie (or Silkie), and Texel, which vary in hair and color composition.\n\nGuinea pigs have a stout, compact body, which allows them to tolerate excessive cold better than excessive heat. They have a normal body temperature of 101-104 \u00b0F (38-40 \u00b0C) and their ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human's, about 65-75 \u00b0F (18-24 \u00b0C). It's important to note that guinea pigs do not respond well to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts and that consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) have been linked to hyperthermia and death in guinea pigs, especially among pregnant sows."}

These breeds include the English shorthair (also known as the American), Abyssinian, Peruvian, Sheltie (or Silkie), and Texel. These breeds have different hair and color compositions, and they have been selectively bred for certain traits. However, all domesticated guinea pigs belong to the same species, Cavia porcellus, and they originated in the Andes of South America. Wild guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are still commonly found in various regions of South America and are the likely ancestors of the domesticated guinea pig."}

They have large heads, stout necks, rounded rumps, and some of the sounds they emit are similar to those made by pigs. The name \"guinea pig\" is believed to have originated from the Middle High German word merswin, which originally meant \"dolphin\" but was used for guinea pigs due to their grunting sounds. The name \"guinea\" in \"guinea pig\" is not related to the price of a guinea coin or to the country of Guinea, but may be a corruption of \"Guiana\" or an alteration of the word \"coney,\" which was used to refer to rabbits."}

Guinea pigs are popular pets due to their docile nature, friendly responsiveness, and relatively easy care. However, they do require a commitment to daily feeding and cleaning, as well as regular grooming for longhaired breeds. It's also important to provide them with appropriate housing, socialization, and enrichment to ensure their wellbeing.

In some cases, it may be interconnected using slotted pipe to make a larger dry well system, discharge into man-made excavations known as recharge basins or retention ponds, or be stored in large storage tanks or ponds until it can be treated. In Chicago, there is a system of tunnels called the Deep Tunnel that stores stormwater. However, there are usually no treatment facilities in the piping system."}

It lies below the outlet where water from the top of the catchbasin reservoir overflows into the sewer proper. In the United States, catchbasins are typically not designed to prevent sewer gases from escaping, but in the United Kingdom, they are designed as true water-filled traps and do block the egress of gases and rodents. The performance of catchbasins in removing sediment and pollutants depends on their design, such as the size of the sump, and on routine maintenance. Catchbasins may contain stagnant water during drier parts of the year and can be used by mosquitos for breeding. Larvicides, disruptive larval hormones, or physical barriers can be used to control mosquito breeding in catchbasins."}

In general, storm drains are designed to collect and transport rainwater and runoff from streets, roads, and roofs away from built-up areas to prevent flooding and erosion. The water is typically discharged untreated into nearby bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. However, some cities have implemented additional features such as detention tanks, roof detention systems, and treatment facilities to manage stormwater more sustainably. For example, Chicago has a system of tunnels called the Deep Tunnel to store stormwater, and Cleveland, Ohio, has public awareness campaigns to prevent waste from being dumped into storm drains. In Minoan Crete, ancient cities were designed with storm drains and channels to collect precipitation runoff.

In India, for example, out of 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial sewage treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities. Over 100 Indian cities dump untreated sewage directly into the Ganges River. In the Philippines, only 5% of the total population is connected to a sewer network, and since sludge treatment and disposal facilities are rare, most effluents are discharged without treatment. In Venezuela, despite having a total of 150 plants for sewage treatment, 13% of the population lacked access to drinking water, although this number had been dropping.\n\nAdditionally, of note is that a staggering 2.5 billion people still do not have access to toilets or latrines, and stopping open defecation is a key factor in the progress of sanitation goals. In 2013, UN Member States adopted the Sanitation for All resolution calling for increased efforts to improve access to proper sanitation. However, the number of slum dwellers continues to grow due to the fast pace of urbanization, with an estimated 863 million in 2012, compared to 650 million in 1990 and 760 million in 2000."}

However, Japan's dependence on petroleum from the US certainly played a role in the escalating tensions between the two countries. The US oil embargo, which was a response to Japan's actions in China and Indochina, created a crisis for Japan as it was heavily reliant on US petroleum.

However, it is mentioned that the US led the occupation of Japan and administrated Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. Additionally, Korea, which was formerly under Japanese rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the US in the South between 1945 and 1948. The separate republics that emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948 led ultimately to the Korean War.

Primates, various species of carnivorans, birds of prey, reptiles, and other primates are all known to prey on wild cavies. Even gorillas have been recorded as prey. To protect themselves, wild cavies have evolved several antipredator adaptations, including crypsis, alarm calls, and mobbing. Different species of wild cavies have separate alarm calls for different predators, such as air-borne or ground-dwelling predators. Predation may also have shaped group size in wild cavies, as species exposed to higher predation pressures tend to live in larger groups."}

Inability to ovulate: This could be due to malformation of the eggs or conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome where the eggs only partially develop within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones.\n2. Issues with the system that produces eggs: If this system is not working at optimum levels, it could hinder conception.\n3. Hormonal imbalance: If a woman's hormones are not balanced, it could also affect her ability to conceive.\n4. Structural problems: Certain structural problems such as fallopian tube obstruction, which can be caused by diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea, can lead to infertility.\n\nMale Infertility:\n1. Low semen quality: This is the most common cause of male infertility. It can be due to endocrine problems, drugs, radiation, or infection.\n2. Testicular malformations: These can also contribute to male infertility.\n3. Hormone imbalance: An imbalance in hormones can affect a man's ability to father a child.\n4. Blockage of the duct system: If the man's duct system is blocked, it could prevent the sperm from reaching the egg.\n5. Primary ciliary dyskinesia: This condition can cause infertility by affecting the sperm's ability to provide the zygote with necessary DNA, centrioles, and activation factor.\n6. Antisperm antibodies: These can cause immune infertility.\n7. Adeno-associated virus: Although this virus is otherwise not harmful, it has been suggested by German scientists to have a role in male infertility.\n\nPlease note that estimates suggest that 20 - 30 % of infertility cases are due to male infertility, 20 - 35 % are due to female infertility, and 25 - 40 % are due to combined problems in both parts. In 10 - 20 % of cases, no cause is found."}

One significant factor was the gradual weakening of its military due to the neglect of the theme system and the increasing reliance on expensive foreign mercenaries. This was exacerbated by the fact that as the threat of invasion receded, the need for large garrisons and expensive fortifications declined. \n\nAnother reason was the economic downturn, which was partly caused by efforts to revive the Byzantine economy that only resulted in inflation and a debased gold coinage. The army was seen as an unnecessary expense and a political threat, leading to the cashiering of native troops and their replacement with foreign mercenaries.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire also faced numerous external threats, including the Arabs who controlled Syria and the Levant and sent frequent raiding parties into Asia Minor. The Arab fleet even laid siege to Constantinople in 674-678, but it was repulsed through the use of Greek fire. However, the Anatolian raids continued and contributed to the demise of classical urban culture.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire's fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 was also a significant event that marked the end of the empire. By this time, Egypt had been under Muslim control for seven centuries, but Orthodoxy was very strong in Russia, which had recently acquired an autocephalous status and called itself the Third Rome as the cultural heir of Constantinople."}

In April 1776, the North Carolina Provincial Congress issued the Halifax Resolves, which explicitly authorized its delegates to vote for independence. This made North Carolina the first colony to take such a step. In May, Congress called on all the states to write constitutions and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule, to which North Carolina complied.\n\nDuring the war, North Carolina was the site of fierce guerrilla warfare between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. The war was not only about independence but also served as an opportunity to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at King's Mountain along the North Carolina - South Carolina border, where a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina and southwest Virginia overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson. This victory gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence and prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n\nIn addition, the Cherokee allies of Britain attacked the western frontier areas of North Carolina early in the war, which resulted in the defeat of the Cherokee and the rise of the Chickamauga Cherokee, bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a frontier war for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.\n\nOverall, North Carolina's participation in the American Revolution was marked by significant contributions to the cause of independence, both in terms of political actions and military victories."}

Although the state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in Richmond, only small battles took place within its borders.\n\nDespite North Carolina's support for the Confederacy, some of its citizens refused to back the Confederate cause. In the state's mountains and western Piedmont region, some yeoman farmers remained neutral, while others covertly supported the Union. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army. In addition, two Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state, which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Numerous slaves also escaped to Union lines, becoming essentially free.\n\nThe first Confederate soldier killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina. The 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment. The 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield during the Battle of Chickamauga. At Appomattox Court House in Virginia, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War.\n\nConfederate troops from North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865. In April 1865, after losing the Battle of Morrisville, Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place, in what is today Durham. North Carolina's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate"}

It is the second largest employer in India, after agriculture, and contributed $482 billion (22% of GDP) and employed 249.94 million people (57% of the workforce) in 2016. The industry is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2020.\n\nMost of the retail industry in India consists of local mom-and-pop stores, owner-manned shops, and street vendors. However, retail supermarkets are expanding, with a market share of 4% in 2008. The Indian government permitted 51% FDI in multi-brand retail and 100% FDI in single-brand retail in 2012, but a lack of back-end warehouse infrastructure and state-level permits and red tape continue to limit the growth of organized retail.\n\nCompliance with over thirty regulations, such as \"signboard licenses\" and \"anti-hoarding measures,\" must be made before a store can open for business. There are also taxes for moving goods from state to state and even within states, which contribute to a third of India's agriculture produce being lost from spoilage due to a lack of infrastructure and efficient retail networks.\n\nChennai, an IT hub, is an important gold market in India and contributes to 45% of the 800-tonne annual national gold uptake. The city is also the base to the World Gold Council's India operations, with the city's retail industry majorly concentrated in T.

It is the primary site of new blood cell production, also known as hematopoiesis. Bone marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, including all types of hematopoietic cells such as white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Hematopoietic cells, specifically lymphoid cells, must migrate to other lymphoid organs to complete maturation. Additionally, bone marrow is responsible for generating lymphocytes from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells and performs a valve-like function to prevent the backflow of lymphatic fluid in the lymphatic system. In humans, red marrow is mainly found in the central skeleton, such as the pelvis, sternum, cranium, ribs, vertebrae, and scapulae, and in the proximal epiphyseal ends of long bones like the femur and humerus. The composition of marrow changes with age, and during starvation, the body can convert yellow marrow back to red marrow to increase blood cell production."}

This can be caused by various conditions such as aplastic anemia, malignancies like multiple myeloma, infections like tuberculosis, and exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. Additionally, certain diseases like leukemia can attack the hematologic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning are also due to damage sustained by the bone marrow cells. In some cases, bone marrow transplants may be conducted to treat severe diseases of the bone marrow, including certain forms of cancer such as leukemia."}

Prevention of infections is crucial and can be achieved through vaccination and antibiotics. High fluid intake, folic acid supplementation, and pain medication are also used in the care of people with sickle cell disease. Other treatments include blood transfusion, medication with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), and in rare cases, a transplant of bone marrow cells. During a vaso-occlusive crisis, which is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells that obstruct capillaries, treatment involves hydration, analgesics, and blood transfusion. Pain management requires opioid administration, and for milder crises, some patients may manage on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In cases involving organs such as the penis or lungs, red-blood cell transfusions are used. Gene therapy has also shown promise in treating sickle cell disease, as demonstrated in a 2001 study where mice were successfully treated by using a viral vector to make them express fetal haemoglobin, alleviating sickle cell disease symptoms."}

It involves transplanting bone marrow from a healthy donor to a patient with sickle cell disease. The bone marrow of the donor must be a close match to the patient's, as determined by HLA typing. Ideally, a close relative would serve as the donor. However, finding a suitable donor can be challenging, as it is only possible in about 10% of people. Furthermore, there is a risk of complications, including graft versus host disease, and approximately 7% of people die as a result of the procedure.\n\nIn terms of gene therapy, phase 1 clinical trials in humans were started in 2014 to assess the safety and initial evidence for efficacy of an autologous transplant of lentiviral vector-modified bone marrow for adults with severe sickle cell disease.

The moon waxes (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing) as it moves through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, gibbous moon, and full moon phases. After the full moon, the moon wanes (the illuminated surface is decreasing) and passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, crescent moon, and back to new moon phases. The shape of the illuminated portion of the moon depends on its position in its orbit around the Earth."}

However, most scholars reject this idea due to the popularity of the name Hamnet at the time and the fact that Hamlet is deeply connected to legend. It is noted that the name of Hamnet Sadler, a neighbor of Shakespeare in Stratford, was often written as Hamlet Sadler, and in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable. \n\nAs for Bennet Omalu, there is no direct connection to Shakespeare's Hamnet or his play Hamlet in the provided documents. Bennet Omalu is a professor in the UC Davis Department of Medical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. He was born in Nnokwa , Idemili South , Anambra in southeastern Nigeria and his family name, Omalu, translates to 'he who knows, speak'.\n\nThe name Hamnet is of English origin, and it is a variant of the name Hammond, which means 'home ruler'. It is not directly related to the Germanic word 'Ham' which means 'home' and 'Hock' which is a cut of meat from the hind leg of a pig. \n\nIn summary, while there are some intriguing connections between the names Hamnet and Hamlet, as well as the use of ham hock as a culinary ingredient, there is no direct evidence to connect Shakespeare's Hamnet to his play Hamlet or to the medical professor Bennet Omalu."}

Shakespeare, along with the Tudor chroniclers who influenced him, was obligated to depict the downfall of the Plantagenet House of York and the victory of the House of Tudor as good conquering evil. This portrayal led to Richard III being depicted as a villain.\n\nThe play contains many historical inaccuracies, including the portrayal of Richard III's physical appearance and the circumstances surrounding his rise to power. Shakespeare's sources, such as Holinshed's Chronicles, contributed to these inaccuracies.\n\nMoreover, Shakespeare may have conformed to the growing \"Tudor Myth\" of the day and taken into account new theologies of divine action and human will becoming popular in the wake of the Protestant Reformation. He may have sought to paint Richard as the final curse of God on England in punishment for the deposition of Richard II in 1399.\n\nOverall, while Richard III contains historical elements, it is not entirely historically accurate and should be viewed with a critical eye."}

In the case of Egypt, the archaeological discoveries brought ancient Egypt into the Western historical narrative, placing it on par with ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. This further legitimized Western colonial rule over Egypt, as European colonialists saw themselves as the political successors of these ancient cultures. Moreover, the writings of European archaeologists and tourists often depicted modern Egyptians as uncivilized and savage, contrasting them with the splendor of ancient Egypt. This further served to justify colonial rule by creating a perceived need for European guardianship over the colonized populations.\n\nIn summary, archaeological discoveries provided colonialists with a means to create and reinforce narratives that supported their political agendas, including justifications for colonial rule and the belief in the need for European guardianship.

Evidence suggests that they had settlements in Central Europe, specifically in the Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne cultures, but their origins can also be traced back to the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture, with recent approaches introducing a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation. The Celts were known for their smiths and metalworkers, who created weapons and jewelry for international trade. After the Roman conquests under Caesar and Claudius, Roman local government in these regions mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, with native involvement in local government.\n\nThere are different theories regarding the origin and dispersion of the Celts in the Iberian Peninsula. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick suggested that the Celtic settlement of the British Isles might date back to the Bell Beaker culture. Mart\u00edn Almagro Gorbea proposed that the origins of the Celts could be traced back to the 3rd millennium BC, seeking the initial roots in the Beaker period. John Koch and Barry Cunliffe have suggested that Celtic origins lie with the Atlantic Bronze Age, extending along the Atlantic coast of Europe.\n\nRegarding primary sources in history and archaeological discoveries in the context of colonialists, primary sources are firsthand accounts or direct evidence about a topic or event created at the time it occurred.

During the Revolution, the Hudson River played a key role due to its connection to the Mohawk River, allowing travelers to reach the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Its proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain also allowed the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City, which was part of a strategy to cut off the patriot hub of New England and focus on rallying support from loyalists in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Hudson River became a major location for production during the Industrial Revolution. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast, leading to the establishment of hundreds of factories around the Hudson in towns such as Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The river's link to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes enabled manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, to use the river for transport.\n\nAdditionally, the Hudson River was made even more vital for trade with the completion of various canals, such as the Erie Canal, Champlain Canal, Oswego Canal, Cayuga-Seneca Canal, and Delaware and Hudson Canal. These canals connected the Hudson River with other significant waterways, making the Hudson one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation.\n\nIn terms of geography, the lower Hudson is a tidal estuary, with tidal influence extending as far as the Federal Dam in Troy. Strong tides and ice floes during the winter can make parts of New York Harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate."}

Cummings, whose full name was Edward Estlin Cummings, was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He was born on October 14, 1894, and passed away on September 3, 1962. Cummings is estimated to have written around 2900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.\n\nFrom a young age, Cummings was interested in poetry and started writing daily when he was 8 years old, experimenting with various forms. He attended Harvard University, where he developed a fondness for modern poetry that disregarded traditional grammar and syntax, favoring a more dynamic use of language. After graduating, he worked for a book dealer.\n\nCummings was influenced by notable modernists like Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, as well as imagist experiments by Amy Lowell. His early work reflected this influence, but during his visits to Paris, he was exposed to Dada and surrealism, which he later incorporated into his poetry. His style evolved to rely more on symbolism and allegory, using symbols instead of explicit comparisons in his later work. This shift resulted in poetry that was often more lucid, moving, and profound.\n\nCummings also had a strong affinity for incorporating imagery of nature and death into his poetry. His complete papers are preserved at the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin."}

The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .)\n- United States (Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 , after 1820 , cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South , and along with it , the slave population .)"}

This allows the photographer to position the subject aircraft in specific locations and angles to get the most desirable shot. Some popular uses of air-to-air photography include commercial use and advertising."}
{"_id": "1534a095279f2cb888fb0bea17bd70da<::>2", "text": "|user|: I meant photos taken in the air.", "agent_response": "In air-to-air photography, photos of aircraft in flight are taken using another aircraft as a photo platform. This type of aviation photography allows the photographer to position the subject aircraft in specific locations and angles while both aircraft are in flight. It's important to consider factors like lighting and background to achieve the best results. Some popular uses of air-to-air photography include commercial use and advertising."}
{"_id": "1534a095279f2cb888fb0bea17bd70da<::>3", "text": "|user|: So does the pilot of the second aircraft also act as a photographer?", "agent_response": "Yes, in air-to-air photography, the pilot of the second aircraft often acts as the photographer, controlling the camera to take pictures of the subject aircraft while both aircraft are in flight. Proper placement of the aircraft relative to the sun is essential to achieve the best lighting, and careful consideration of the background helps highlight the subject and avoid distractions."}
{"_id": "1534a095279f2cb888fb0bea17bd70da<::>4", "text": "|user|: Is air-to-air photography more difficult than ground-to-air?", "agent_response": "Both air-to-air and ground-to-air photography have their own challenges, and the difficulty may depend on various factors such as the photographer's experience, equipment, and specific conditions. However, air-to-air photography is generally considered more challenging due to the additional complexities of managing two aircraft in flight, maintaining a stable platform for shooting, and coordinating the positioning of the subject aircraft for optimal lighting and composition. Ground-to-air photography, on the other hand, usually involves a stationary photographer on the ground, but requires a long focus lens to capture the aircraft from a distance."}
{"_id": "1534a095279f2cb888fb0bea17bd70da<::>5", "text": "|user|: What are other types of aviation photography?", "agent_response": "Yes, there are other types of aviation photography. In addition to air-to-air and ground-to-air photography, there are also ground-static photography and remote photography. Ground-static photography involves taking photos of stationary aircraft on the ground, giving the photographer full control over lighting, aircraft placement, camera angles, and background. Remote photography is a variation of aerial air-to-air photography, where the camera is mounted onto the external aircraft structure and triggered remotely, with the image composition planned on the ground."}
