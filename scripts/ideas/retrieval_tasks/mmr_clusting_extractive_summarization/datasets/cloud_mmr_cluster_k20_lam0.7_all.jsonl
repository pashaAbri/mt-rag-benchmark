Long-term retention: This feature can be used by any user that needs long-term data retention in their environment, including but not limited to organizations in industries like Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives.\n3. Legal compliance: Immutable Object Storage can help organizations that deal with financial records management, such as broker-dealer transactions, and might need to store data in a non-rewritable and non-erasable format to comply with laws and regulations.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Limited availability: Immutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only.\n2. Pricing: It requires a Standard pricing plan.\n3. Incompatibility with high-speed transfer: It isn't possible to use Aspera high-speed transfer with buckets with a retention policy.\n4. Irreversibility: Once a retention policy is defined for a bucket, data is stored in a non-erasable and non-rewritable manner until the end of the retention period. This could potentially lead to issues if data needs to be deleted before the retention period expires.\n\nPlease note that the actual advantages and disadvantages may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements."}

The IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry is a managed service provided by IBM that allows you to store and manage container images in a private, multi-tenant registry. It is designed to be highly available, scalable, and encrypted for security. The service runs in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service clusters and uses IBM Cloud Object Storage to store images. By default, image data in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted at rest. The registry is organized into private namespaces, which are strictly owned by single accounts and can be controlled using Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies.\n\nThe IBM Cloud Container Registry can also be integrated with IBM Vulnerability Advisor, which scans images for security issues and provides an evaluation report based on security practices specific to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. However, it is important to note that Vulnerability Advisor cannot scan encrypted images.\n\nThe IBM Cloud Container Registry is a component of the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and can be used to deploy highly available apps in Docker containers that run in Kubernetes clusters. The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides platform metrics, and the IBM Cloud Monitoring service can be used to monitor these metrics.\n\nIn summary, the IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry is a managed service for storing and managing container images, with a focus on security, scalability, and availability. It can be integrated with other IBM Cloud services, such as IBM Vulnerability Advisor and IBM Cloud Monitoring, to provide a comprehensive container management solution."}

It is a two-way communication channel that allows for messages to be sent in both directions at any time. The WebSocket API is used in the Text to Speech service in IBM Cloud to send two types of parameters: query parameters and message parameters.\n\nQuery parameters are sent when the phone integration connects to the service. They are used to specify information such as the voice that should be used, the type of audio file that should be returned, and whether or not speech barge-in should be enabled.\n\nMessage parameters, on the other hand, are sent as part of the JSON data in the request body. They are used to specify more complex commands, such as changing the assistant's voice during the conversation or transferring a call to a live agent.\n\nIt's important to note that the WebSocket API can return different or additional response codes depending on the WebSocket implementations of the SDKs. For more information on these response codes, you can refer to the IBM Cloud Text to Speech API documentation and the API & SDK reference.\n\nI hope this gives you a better understanding of the WebSocket API in the context of IBM Cloud. If you have any more questions, please let me know!"}
{"_id": "b4614daadceeecb400f7baf0aa48dcb8<::>3", "text": "|user|: How can I use the WebSocket API?", "agent_response": "To use the WebSocket API in IBM Cloud, you first need to establish a connection with the service by calling its `/v1/synthesize` method. This method allows you to synthesize text to speech. You then send the text to be synthesized to the service as a JSON text message over the connection. The service automatically closes the WebSocket connection when it finishes processing the request.\n\nHere are the basic steps to use the WebSocket API:\n\n1. Open a connection by calling the `/v1/synthesize` method over the WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol. The method is available at a specific endpoint, which includes the location of your application and the unique identifier of the service instance.\n2. Send input text as a JSON text message over the connection.\n3. Receive a response from the service.\n\nThe WebSocket interface accepts identical input and produces identical results as the GET and POST `/v1/synthesize` methods of the HTTP interface. It also supports the use of the SSML `<mark>` element to identify the location of user-specified markers in the audio and can return timing information for all strings of the input text.\n\nYou can find more information about obtaining word timings and the WebSocket interface and its parameters in the API & SDK reference.\n\nPlease note that the WebSocket API used in the Text to Speech service in IBM Cloud is different from the WebSocket API used in the Speech to Text service. The WebSocket API in the Speech to Text service is used to make a recognition request and requires the use of a specific `/v1/recognize` method. The WebSocket API in the Text to Speech service, on the other hand, is used to synthesize text to speech and requires the use of the `/v1/synthesize` method."}

However, restoring a volume from a backup or snapshot is a manual operation that takes time. The backup service does not provide continual backup with automatic failover. This means that while the backup service is secure and reliable, the restoration process may not be as swift, and could potentially impact recovery times in the event of a failure.\n\nSecondly, for best performance, you can enable snapshots for fast restore. This feature allows you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. This could be seen as an evolution of security protocols, where the system is not only focusing on data protection but also on data recovery speed and performance.\n\nLastly, you can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region for disaster recovery scenarios. This feature can be used manually later or can be created automatically as part of a backup plan. This demonstrates IBM Cloud VPC's commitment to evolving its security protocols to meet the demands of various disaster recovery scenarios.\n\nHowever, the document does not provide specifics on how cloud computing security protocols have evolved over time in general, or how these evolutions have directly impacted the restoration process of volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC."}

It is used to protect sensitive information, especially when data is stored or transmitted across networks. The encryption process uses an algorithm and a key to scramble the data, and the data can only be accessed or read by authorized parties who have the correct decryption key. There are different types of data encryption, including symmetric encryption (where the same key is used for encryption and decryption) and asymmetric encryption (where two different keys, a public key and a private key, are used for encryption and decryption). IBM Cloud VPC offers both IBM-managed encryption and customer-managed encryption options for data at rest and in transit."}

A public cloud includes a shared set of resources that are provisioned to allow access to a company's resources. It is hosted in a multi-tenant environment on a virtual server, and it can be accessed from anywhere.\n2. A private cloud includes resources that are provisioned to allow access to a company's resources. It is hosted on dedicated hardware, such as a bare metal server, and either onsite at the company's office (or across offices) or by a cloud provider. A private cloud can be accessed from anywhere.\n3. A hybrid cloud includes resources that combine the aspects of both public and private clouds. It is hosted both onsite at a company's office (or across offices) and by a cloud provider. A hybrid cloud can be accessed from anywhere."}

Each Plan can specify billing costs for customers who use the Product. Plans can share APIs, and subscription approval may be required depending on the Plan. Rate limits can also be enforced through Plans or through operations within a Plan's APIs, which can override the Plan's rate limit.\n\nThere are two account types for billing with IBM Cloud: Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription. The Subscription account type offers a discount on usage costs in exchange for a spending commitment, with fixed billing for the subscription amount. The Enterprise Savings Plan billing model is similar to a Subscription account and offers added benefits.\n\nThe IBM Cloud billable account charges for compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. Charging types include Fixed (based on an agreed-upon monthly charge), Metered (based on GB hours consumed for runtimes and IP addresses and storage for containers), and Tiered (volume-based discount according to usage).\n\nRegarding the CIS plans, there are five offerings: Standard, Next, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Advanced, and Enterprise Premier. Each offering varies in the number of domains, DNS records, global load balancers, and their respective features. The Enterprise plans allow for a higher number of pools, origin servers, health checks, and additional features such as Smart Routing and health checks from multiple regions.\n\nFor more specific information about the billing plans, please refer to the documents as they contain detailed features and costs for each plan."}

This means that you pay the same amount every month for a specific service or resource, regardless of how much you use it. This type of pricing is common for services that have predictable usage, such as a dedicated server or a fixed number of API calls.\n* **Metered:** Metered-usage pricing is based on the actual usage of a service or resource. You pay for what you use, usually on a per-unit basis, such as the number of GB hours consumed for runtimes or the number of IP addresses and storage for containers. This type of pricing is common for services that have variable usage, such as cloud computing resources or data storage.\n* **Tiered:** Tiered pricing is based on a volume-based discount according to your actual usage. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. In a simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. In a graduated tier model, the unit price per tier decreases as your level of usage increases. The total price is the cumulative charges for each level of usage, consisting of your quantity multiplied by the unit price at that tier. This type of pricing is common for services that have high quantities of usage per month, such as API calls or data transfer.\n* **Reserved:** Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. This type of pricing is common for services that require a predictable and consistent level of usage, such as databases, messaging systems, or machine learning models.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the differences between these pricing models!

The first type conditions on an intent value and has child nodes that each condition on an entity value. This type is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements.\n\n2. The second type is a node with slots that also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user and looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable. This type is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.\n\nAdditionally, there are response types that can be added to a dialog node, such as Connect to human agent, Image, Option, and Pause.

The first type conditions on an intent value and has child nodes that each condition on an entity value. This type is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements.\n2. The second type is a node with slots that also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user and looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable. This type is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf.\n\nAdditionally, there are response types that can be added to a dialog node, such as Connect to human agent, Image, Option, and Pause. However, these are not exactly types of dialog nodes, but rather response types that a dialog node can use."}

These features include securing the Kubernetes API server, etcd data store, worker node, network, storage, images, and deployments against malicious attacks. You can also leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect such attacks and suspicious usage patterns.\n\nAs for access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources. This is done through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies you assign to users depend on what you want them to be able to do. For more information on the types of access policies and how to assign them, see the provided documentation.\n\nIn terms of specific roles, the document suggests some examples for different use cases. For instance, for a user who needs to manage a cluster but not create or update pods, you might assign the \"Cluster Administrator\" role. For a user who needs to create and update pods, you might assign the \"Editor\" role. For a user who only needs to view resources and logs, you might assign the \"Viewer\" role.\n\nIt's also important to note that you can choose to register a Secrets Manager instance to your cluster during the cluster create process, and specify a secret group to control access to the secrets in your cluster. Data encryption with a key management service (KMS) can also be used to encrypt secrets and other sensitive information in your cluster."}

Machine learning pre-annotators use a machine learning model to automatically annotate documents, and can be a good choice if the new set of documents is similar to the documents that were used to train the machine learning annotator originally. Rule-based pre-annotators use a rule-based model to automatically annotate documents, and can incorporate some of the function of the dictionary pre-annotator if enabled.\n\nYou can run multiple pre-annotators at once in IBM Watson Knowledge Studio.

{"_id": "fdee20f7fd677e420742b09989623d68<::>4", "text": "|user|: How secure is the web chat for passing sensitive data?", "agent_response": "Yes, the web chat integration is designed to be secure for passing sensitive data. It uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all messages sent between the web chat and the assistant, which helps protect sensitive data as it travels through the network. Additionally, web chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure that each message originates from your website and to authenticate users securely. You can also encrypt sensitive data in the JWT payload for added security. However, it's important to note that you should still follow best practices for handling sensitive data, such as generating a new JWT at the beginning of each session and never hardcoding or sharing JWTs between users.\n\nBefore enabling security, make sure to create an RS256 public/private key pair and save it in a secure location. Implement a function on your server to generate and return a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with your private key, which will be used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nFor more detailed information on enabling web chat security, refer to the document titled \"[Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable)\"."}

Obsolete images can still be listed and used, but they will not appear when searching for images to create new instances. This command can help in managing image lifecycle and avoiding confusion by marking older images as obsolete.\n2. `image-deprecate` command: This command is used to mark an image as deprecated. Deprecated images can still be listed and used, but they will be displayed with a warning message. This command can help in managing image lifecycle and notifying users to switch to newer images.\n\nAdditionally, Version 6.15.0 also added support for image lifecycle management in `image-create`, `image-update`, and `images` commands. This means you can now manage the lifecycle of images more easily by creating, updating, listing, and deleting images using a single set of commands. This can help in automating image management and reducing the time and effort required to manage images.\n\nLet me know if you need more information about these new commands or any other aspect of the IBM Cloud VPC CLI."}
