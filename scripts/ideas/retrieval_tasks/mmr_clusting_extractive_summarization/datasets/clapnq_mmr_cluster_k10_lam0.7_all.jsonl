The game is played with a spherical ball, and the teams consist of 11 players each. On the other hand, American football, also known simply as football in the United States and Canada, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, which is the team controlling the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the defense aims to stop the offense's advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.\n\nThe main difference between the two sports lies in their gameplay and rules. In soccer, players are not allowed to use their hands or arms to control the ball, except for the goalkeepers. The game is focused on kicking, dribbling, and passing the ball to teammates to score goals. In contrast, American football allows for the use of hands and arms to handle the ball. It has a more complex set of rules that govern the movement of the ball, including forward passes, laterals, and running with the ball. The game also features a more extensive range of player positions, each with specific roles and responsibilities."}

For example, in the Olympic Games, there are currently two events (synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics) from which male athletes are excluded, while women are still unable to compete in the Nordic Combined event in the Winter Olympics. Similarly, in women's association football, there have been struggles for pay and opportunities equal to those of male football players, and the sport has received less media coverage than the men's equivalent.

It is a viral infection that can cause sores or blisters on the skin or mucous membranes, typically around the mouth (HSV-1) or genitals (HSV-2). The virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through direct contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person. This can occur through skin-to-skin contact, or by exposure to infected saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, or the fluid from herpetic blisters. The virus can also be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. Once a person is infected, the virus remains in their body for life, and can cause recurring outbreaks. However, it is typically not a life-threatening condition.\n\nRegarding the transmission of herpes from mother to baby, the risk is highest if the mother becomes infected around the time of delivery, since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child. In contrast, the risk falls to 3% if the infection is recurrent, and is 1-3% if the woman is seropositive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and is less than 1% if no lesions are visible. Women seropositive for only one type of HSV are only half as likely to transmit HSV as infected seronegative mothers. To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1-seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth and, should lesions be present, to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal. The use of antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy, limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.\n\nIn terms of frequency and severity of recurrent outbreaks, some individuals' outbreaks can be quite debilitating, with large, painful lesions persisting for several weeks, while others"}

Here is a general overview of the process:\n\n1. Live-attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus. To create these vaccines, the virus is cultured in a lab and then attenuated, or weakened, through various means such as repeated passage in cell culture or exposure to chemicals or radiation.\n\n2. Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain viruses that have been killed using chemicals or heat. The virus is grown in a lab and then treated with a chemical or heat to kill it while keeping its structure intact.\n\n3. Subunit vaccines: These vaccines contain only specific parts of the virus, such as the capsid proteins. To create these vaccines, biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to isolate and replicate the desired viral components.\n\n4. mRNA vaccines: These vaccines contain genetic material that instructs cells to produce a specific viral protein. To create these vaccines, the mRNA is synthesized in a lab and then encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle for delivery to cells.\n\n5. Recombinant vaccines: These vaccines are created by genetically modifying a harmless virus or bacterium to produce a specific viral protein. The genetically modified organism is then grown in a lab, and the viral protein is purified for use in the vaccine.\n\nThe specific method used to create a vaccine depends on the type of virus and the desired immune response. It is important to note that the development and testing of a vaccine can take many years, and safety and efficacy must be thoroughly evaluated before a vaccine can be approved for use."}

{"_id": "cfbcfa3e382f12aed450b10f87a72aeb<::>3", "text": "|user|: Could you tell me more about the appearance or body of guinea pigs?", "agent_response": "Guinea pigs are animals that are built somewhat like pigs, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence. They can vary in size, with males being about 30% larger than females. The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while male genitals may look similar, but the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling. Domesticated guinea pigs occur in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair.\n\nRegarding the guinea pig's body temperature and tolerance, they have a stout, compact body and more easily tolerate excessive cold than excessive heat. Their normal body temperature is 101 -- 104 \u00b0 F (38 -- 40 \u00b0 C), so their ideal ambient air temperature range is about 65 -- 75 \u00b0 F (18 -- 24 \u00b0 C). Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90 \u00b0 F (32 \u00b0 C) have been linked to hyperthermia and death, especially among pregnant sows. Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30 -- 70 %."}

Additionally, guinea pigs make sounds similar to pigs and spend a significant amount of time eating, further contributing to the name. The \"guinea\" part of the name is believed to come from the animals being brought to Europe by way of Guinea, or from the term being used as a general reference to far-off, unknown countries, signifying the animal's exotic appeal. The name is not related to the price of a guinea coin or the animal originating from Guinea in Africa."}

It is designed to capture large sediments and street litter from urban runoff before it enters the storm drainage pipes. It consists of a reservoir with an inlet and an outlet. The inlet is typically located at the curb level to collect stormwater runoff, while the outlet is connected to the storm drainage pipes. Within the catchbasin, there is usually a sump or sediment chamber, where some of the heavier sediment and small objects may settle. This function is similar to the trap in household wastewater plumbing, which traps objects and prevents them from entering the sewer system. In the United Kingdom, catchbasins, also known as gully pots, are designed as true water-filled traps, which block the egress of gases and rodents. The performance of catchbasins at removing sediment and other pollutants depends on the design of the catchbasin and on routine maintenance."}

However, the Clean Water Act in the United States does require cities, suburban communities, and towns with a population of over 10,000 to obtain discharge permits for their storm sewer systems. These permits require local governments to operate stormwater management programs, which can include the construction of new buildings and facilities and the maintenance of existing municipal drainage networks. Many municipalities have revised their local ordinances to include commercial and residential stormwater management practices that can help minimize runoff into storm sewers. These practices can include the use of sustainable urban drainage systems, low impact development, green infrastructure, and permeable paving materials. However, these practices are generally aimed at reducing the amount of stormwater runoff and improving water quality, rather than specifically recycling stormwater for household use."}

In Minoan Crete, cities such as Phaistos were designed to have storm drains and channels to collect precipitation runoff. At Cretan Knossos, storm drains include stone-lined structures large enough for a person to crawl through. Additionally, early civilizations in Mainland Orkney, such as Gurness and the Brough of Birsay in Scotland, had elements of stormwater drain systems. In ancient Egypt, the Nile River played a significant role in the civilization's agricultural practices and spiritual life, with the river's annual flooding and controlled irrigation contributing to surplus crops and the pharaoh and Hapy, the god of the annual floods, being thought to control the flooding. The Mesopotamian civilization also had advanced stormwater management systems, with the Tigris and Euphrates rivers being vital for agriculture, transportation, and construction materials. Early Mesopotamian settlers used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops and developed irrigation systems for reliable food production. Over time, the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils due to irrigation, leading to urban decline and a shift in power to Akkad."}

However, it is known that the US occupation of Japan, led by General Douglas MacArthur, focused on rebuilding and democratizing Japan, while the Soviet Union's occupations in other parts of the world, such as eastern Germany and northern Korea, typically involved the establishment of communist regimes. In the case of Korea, the division of the peninsula into North and South, each occupied by a different superpower, ultimately led to the Korean War. Considering these factors, it can be inferred that Japan might have faced significant challenges and potential conflict had it been occupied by the USSR instead of the US. The US occupation allowed Japan to focus on rebuilding and democratizing its nation without the ideological upheaval that might have come with a Soviet occupation."}

Roosevelt served as the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945.\n2. He won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century.\n3. Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression and implemented his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history.\n4. As a dominant leader of his party, he built the New Deal Coalition, which realigned American politics into the Fifth Party System and defined American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century.\n5. His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II, and he played a significant role in shaping and financing the war efforts.\n6. Roosevelt is often rated by scholars as one of the three greatest U.S. Presidents, along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n7. Roosevelt's father died in 1900, causing great distress for him. The following year, Roosevelt's fifth cousin Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States, who became Franklin's role model and hero.\n8. Roosevelt graduated from Harvard in 1903 with an A.B. in history and entered Columbia Law School in 1904, but dropped out in 1907 after passing the New York bar exam.\n9. In 1908, he took a job with the prestigious Wall Street firm of Carter Ledyard & Milburn, working in the firm's admiralty law division.\n10. Roosevelt's personal life included marrying his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt, and having six children together.\n11. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness, believed at the time to be polio, and founded the treatment center in Warm Springs, Georgia, for people with poliomyelitis.\n12.

In the wild, they also consume a variety of other plant materials. Domesticated guinea pigs benefit from a diet of fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, and food pellets which are often based on timothy hay. Additionally, they require a minimum of 10 mg of vitamin C daily, which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables or through dietary supplements. However, it's important to note that some plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax, and wild celery, as well as any plant that grows from a bulb and ivy and oak tree leaves."}

This can be due to endocrine problems, drugs, radiation, or infection. There may also be testicular malformations, hormone imbalance, or blockage of the man's duct system. Some of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions, while others may be indefinite. Infertility associated with viable, but immotile sperm may be caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia. A defect in any of the sperm structures required for fertilization (DNA, centrioles, and activation factor) may result in infertility that will not be detected by semen analysis. Antisperm antibodies can also cause immune infertility. German scientists have reported that a virus called Adeno-associated virus might have a role in male infertility. Other diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause infertility due to internal scarring (fallopian tube obstruction).\n\nFor females, infertility can be caused by the inability to ovulate or malformation of the eggs themselves. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is an example where the eggs only partially develop within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones. Some women are infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs. For a woman to conceive, vaginal intercourse must take place around the time when an egg is released from her ovary, the system that produces eggs has to be working at optimum levels, and her hormones must be balanced. The most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory problems, which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods. Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. In 10-20% of cases, no cause is found for infertility in either males or females."}

The fall of the Byzantine Empire was due to several factors, including military and economic difficulties. After the 10th century, the Byzantine military began to rely more on foreign mercenaries, which proved to be expensive and less reliable than native troops. Additionally, the empire struggled with inflation and a debased gold coinage, making it difficult to maintain a strong economy.\n\nThe empire also faced numerous invasions and attacks from various groups, such as the Arabs, Slavs, and later the Ottomans. The Arab invasions in the 7th century, in particular, significantly weakened the empire and contributed to the decline of its urban culture. The Arab control of Syria and the Levant also disrupted the free grain shipments to Constantinople, which further exacerbated the empire's economic challenges.\n\nMoreover, the empire's administration was affected by the neglect of the theme system and the increasing power of the civil service. The lack of military and political talent among Basil II's successors also contributed to the empire's decline. Despite efforts to recover and revive the Byzantine economy, these efforts only resulted in inflation and further weakening of the empire.\n\nFinally, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, as the city was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. The remaining territories of the Byzantine Empire were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century.\n\nIn summary, the Byzantine Empire fell due to a combination of military, economic, and administrative challenges, as well as external invasions and attacks."}

In April 1776, it became the first colony to instruct its delegates to the Continental Congress to vote for independence from the British Crown. The state also saw fierce guerrilla warfare between pro-independence and pro-British colonists throughout the Revolutionary War. One significant victory for the American side was the Battle of Kings Mountain, which took place along the North Carolina-South Carolina border on October 7, 1780. This battle prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from Loyalists in the region and gave an advantage to colonists who favored American independence.\n\nHowever, North Carolina had a small per-capita contribution to the war effort, with only 7,800 men joining the Continental Army under General George Washington and an additional 10,000 serving in local militia units. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains by 1789, and the state ceded its western lands to the national government so that the Northwest Territory could be organized and managed nationally.\n\nDuring the war, there was also military action in North Carolina, particularly in 1780-81. The Cherokee allies of Britain attacked the western frontier areas of North Carolina, resulting in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people. The defeat of the Cherokee was directly responsible for the rise of the Chickamauga Cherokee, who carried on a frontier war for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.\n\nOverall, while North Carolina's contribution to the war effort may have been smaller compared to other states, it played a significant role in the southern theater of the American Revolution, with guerrilla warfare, military action, and victories like the Battle of Kings Mountain."}

Approximately 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military, with 20,000 killed in battle and 21,000 dying of disease. The state was the scene of small battles and made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war effort of any Confederate state. However, North Carolina was the site of some major events during the war, including the Battle of Bentonville, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865. Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place, in what is today Durham, in April 1865. The port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865.\n\nAdditionally, some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy during the war. Some yeoman farmers in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral, while others covertly supported the Union cause. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the Union Army and fought for the North. Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free.\n\nAfter the war, Union forces occupied parts of coastal North Carolina, but their presence was not always welcomed by local unionists due to perceived oppressive and callous behavior. The occupiers engaged in pillaging, freeing of slaves, and eviction of those refusing to take or reneging on loyalty oaths, causing some ex-Unionists to support the Confederate cause.\n\nOverall, North Carolina's role in the Civil War included both support for the Confederacy and opposition to it, with a significant number of North Carolinians serving in the Union Army and many slaves escaping to Union lines."}

In adults, it is also found in the proximal epiphyseal ends of long bones such as the femur and humerus. Its main function is to produce new blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. It is also one of the primary lymphoid organs that generate lymphocytes from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells. Additionally, bone marrow performs a valve-like function to prevent the backflow of lymphatic fluid in the lymphatic system."}

This can be caused by various conditions such as aplastic anemia, malignancies like multiple myeloma, infections like tuberculosis, or exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning are due to damage sustained by the bone marrow cells. Additionally, diseases such as leukemia can attack the hematologic progenitor cells in the bone marrow, further impacting the production of blood cells. Specific illnesses like sickle cell disease can cause anemia due to the premature destruction of red blood cells, which the bone marrow is unable to replace at the same rate."}

These may include:\n\n* Infection prevention with vaccination and antibiotics\n* High fluid intake\n* Folic acid supplementation\n* Pain medication\n* Blood transfusion\n* The medication hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea)\n\nIn some cases, a small percentage of people with sickle cell disease can be cured through a transplant of bone marrow cells.\n\nIn addition to these measures, acute chest syndrome, a serious complication of sickle cell disease, is treated with antibiotics, oxygen supplementation, and close observation. If the pulmonary infiltrate worsens or the oxygen requirements increase, simple blood transfusion or exchange transfusion may be indicated. Exchange transfusion involves replacing a significant portion of the person's red cell mass with normal red cells, which decreases the percentage of haemoglobin S in the patient's blood.\n\nAnother approach to treating sickle cell disease involves using gene therapy to increase the production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) in the body. This has been shown to temporarily alleviate sickle cell disease symptoms in humans, and gene therapy may provide a more permanent way to increase therapeutic HbF production.\n\n(Sources: the provided documents)"}

The main challenge is finding a suitable donor, as the bone marrow must come from a person with a closely matching human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type. Ideally, a close relative would be the donor.\n\nThe transplant process involves destroying the recipient's bone marrow using chemotherapy or radiation, followed by infusing the donor's bone marrow cells. The new bone marrow cells then start producing healthy blood cells in the recipient's body. However, this procedure carries a risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD), where the donor's immune cells attack the recipient's tissues, which can be life-threatening.\n\nIn addition, transplants are generally more successful in children than in adults, and there is a risk of death associated with the procedure itself. Therefore, the decision to undergo a bone marrow transplant for sickle cell disease is made carefully, considering the potential benefits and risks for each individual patient."}

Before the 19th century, it was assumed to be west of the Rhine, specifically in Gaul, based on Greek and Roman ancient sources such as Caesar. However, historian Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville challenged this view, placing the land of origin of the Celts east of the Rhine, near the source of the Danube in southern Germany. This was based on Herodotus' account and the findings of the prehistoric cemetery of Hallstat (1846) and the archaeological site of La T\u00e8ne (1857).\n\nThe Celts settled in the British Isles, possibly as early as the Bell Beaker culture (3rd millennium BC) or during the Atlantic Bronze Age (contemporaneous with the Hallstatt culture, extending along the Atlantic coast of Europe).

The church views marriage as serving to unite a woman and a man in eternal union and love before God, with the purpose of following Christ and His Gospel and raising up a faithful, holy family through their holy union.\n\nThe Democratic Party, in its 2012 platform, included support for same-sex marriage and for the repeal of DOMA.

During the Revolution, it was a key river due to its connection to the Mohawk River, allowing travelers to reach the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Its proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain also allowed the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City, which was part of their strategy to cut off the patriot hub of New England and focus on rallying support in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions. \n\nIn the 19th century, the Hudson River became a major location for production during the Industrial Revolution. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast, leading to the establishment of hundreds of factories along its banks. The river's link to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes further facilitated manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, for transport.\n\nFurthermore, the completion of the Erie Canal and other smaller canals connecting to the Hudson River enhanced the development of the American West, making New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation. These canals made the Hudson River one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation, enabling the transportation of coal and other goods between different watersheds.\n\nIn addition to its historical and economic significance, the Hudson River is also environmentally and recreationally important, with various fish species and popular activities such as canoeing, kayaking, and fishing."}
