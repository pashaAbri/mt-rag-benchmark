Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass .

While some scholars do state Peter was the first Bishop of Rome , others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome . Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters \/ bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century , when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted , and that later writers retrospectively applied the term `` bishop of Rome '' to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself . On this basis , Oscar Cullmann and Henry Chadwick question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy , and Raymond E. Brown says that , while it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome , Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having `` roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church '' .

Some 17th - century scholars reasoned that the Wall must have been built in the Ming dynasty , after Marco Polo 's departure .

Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

The Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992 , continued by Richie Petitbon and Norv Turner through 2000 , then again when Gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007 . Meanwhile , the Steelers , who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL -- NFL merger in 1970 , opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road , wearing white . The Steelers ' decision was compared with the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX ; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season , but after winning road playoff games against the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins wearing red jerseys , New England opted to switch to crimson for the Super Bowl as the designated home team . For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50 , Denver general manager John Elway simply stated , `` We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms '' ; they previously had been 0 -- 4 in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys . The Broncos ' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition , losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion . It is unclear why the Patriots chose to wear their white jerseys for Super Bowl LII . During the pairing of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady , New England has mostly worn their blue jerseys for home games , but have worn white for a home game in the 2008 , 2010 , and 2011 seasons . The New England Patriots were 3 - 0 in their white uniforms in Super Bowls prior to Super Bowl LII with Belichick and Brady , and they may have been going on recent trends of teams who wear white for the Super Bowl game .","title":"Super Bowl","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801828967_43370-44057-0-687","score":45.2548383212,"text":"Atlanta\nThe Atlanta Falcons have played in Atlanta since their inception in 1966 .

Editors have combined them in an effort to create one `` inclusive '' text that reflects an imagined `` ideal '' of Shakespeare 's original . Theobald 's version became standard for a long time , and his `` full text '' approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day . Some contemporary scholarship , however , discounts this approach , instead considering `` an authentic Hamlet an unrealisable ideal ... there are texts of this play but no text '' . The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different Hamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis . Other editors have continued to argue the need for well - edited editions taking material from all versions of the play . Colin Burrow has argued that `` most of us should read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions ... it 's about as likely that Shakespeare wrote : `` To be or not to be , ay , there 's the point '' ( in Q1 ) , as that he wrote the works of Francis Bacon .

The economic policies of the British Raj caused a severe decline in the handicrafts and handloom sectors , due to reduced demand and dipping employment .

Thanks to the cotton gin , the amount of raw cotton yielded doubled each decade after 1800 .","title":"Cotton gin","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"805474955_6417-7243-0-826","score":42.7570905044,"text":"Cotton gin\nEli Whitney ( 1765 -- 1825 ) applied for a patent of his cotton gin on October 28 , 1793 ; the patent was granted on March 14 , 1794 , but was not validated until 1807 .

Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

Steve Trevor makes his first live - action theatrical appearance in Wonder Woman , portrayed by Chris Pine , who has signed on for a multi-picture deal . The film places Steve Trevor in the role of partner \/ love interest , as a fellow warrior , like he was portrayed in the original comics . This version of Trevor , a United States Army Air Service 94th Aero Squadron pilot with the American Expeditionary Forces , is a captain and an Allied spy in World War I who has stolen information from a weapons facility in the Ottoman Empire run by German general Erich Ludendorff , whose scientist Doctor Maru is producing a new , deadlier form of mustard gas . Diana goes with Steve to take part in the War , and he acts as her guide into the world outside of Themyscira and how mankind functions . The two grow closer along the way , but are conflicted when Steve is more focused on stopping Doctor Maru 's bombs and Diana thinks that killing Ares will stop the war . In the climax , Steve hijacks a German strategic bomber containing the gas and sacrifices himself to incinerate it at a safe distance , his last words being to tell Diana that he can save today while she could save the world and tells her that he loves her , leaving her with his father 's watch as a keepsake before he jumps onto the plane . His sacrifice leads Diana to believe that ultimately the world can only be saved through love , not hatred . In 2017 , Bruce Wayne retrieves the original group photo and his father 's watch and returns it to Diana , who sends him an email thanking him for bringing Steve back to her .

With his famous Four Freedoms speech in January 1941 , Roosevelt laid out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world . Assisted by Willkie , Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend - Lease program , which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain and China . In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I , there would be no repayment after the war . As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan , Germany , and Italy , American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger .

The actual `` toast '' is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy , healthy , loving life together .

A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the `` Father of American Football '' , established the snap , eleven - player teams , and the concept of downs ; later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone , and specified the size and shape of the football .

The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League .

Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) .

Studies from 2007 -- 2010 applied molecular markers and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals , thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be Cavia tschudii . Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation .

The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1910 , which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent , Gojong .","title":"Korea under Japanese rule","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"818081208_68015-68445-0-430","score":39.7620404007,"text":"Surrender of Japan\nJapanese officials left for Manila on August 19 to meet Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur , and to be briefed on his plans for the occupation .

This pipe is usually manually operated , but is increasingly automated in modern cotton plants . The need for trailers to haul the product to the gin has been drastically reduced since the introduction of modules . If the cotton is shipped in modules , the module feeder breaks the modules apart using spiked rollers and extracts the largest pieces of foreign material from the cotton .

McCarthy 's gin was marketed for use with both short - staple and extra-long staple cotton , but was particularly useful for processing long - staple cotton . After McCarthy 's patent expired in 1861 , McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world . McCarthy 's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida , Georgia and South Carolina . It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins , and , when powered by one horse , produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day . The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint . Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate . In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade .

However , when the Ming Great Wall began to take on a shape still recognizable today , foreign accounts of the Wall slid into hyperbole . In the Atlas Sinensis published in 1665 , the Jesuit Martino Martini described elaborate but atypical stretches of the Great Wall and generalized such fortifications across the whole northern frontier . Furthermore , Martini erroneously identified the Ming Wall as the same wall built by Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC , thereby exaggerating both the Wall 's antiquity and its size . This misconception was compounded by the China Illustrata of Father Athanasius Kircher ( 1602 -- 80 ) , which provided pictures of the Great Wall as imagined by a European illustrator . All these and other accounts from missionaries in China contributed to the Orientalism of the eighteenth century , in which a mythical China and its exaggerated Great Wall feature prominently . The French philosopher Voltaire ( 1694 -- 1774 ) , for example , frequently wrote about the Great Wall , although his feelings towards it oscillate between unreserved admiration and condemnation of it as a `` monument to fear '' . The Macartney Embassy of 1793 passed through the Great Wall at Gubeikou on the way to see the Qianlong Emperor in Chengde , who was there for the annual imperial hunt . One of the embassy 's members , John Barrow , later founder of the Royal Geographical Society , spuriously calculated that the amount of stone in the Wall was equivalent to `` all the dwelling houses of England and Scotland '' and would suffice to encircle the Earth at the equator twice .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.5,"ndcg_cut_5":0.5,"ndcg_cut_10":0.5}}

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play : Hamlet 's sexual relationship with Kate Winslet 's Ophelia , for example , or his childhood affection for Yorick ( played by Ken Dodd ) .","title":"Hamlet","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"837275285_651-1313-0-662","score":25.1068720812,"text":"Hamlet\nHamlet is Shakespeare 's longest play , and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature , with a story capable of `` seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others '' .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League .

However , there is an exception . Vertical sundials in the tropics which face the nearer pole ( e.g. north facing in the zone between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer ) can actually receive sunlight for more than 12 hours from sunrise to sunset for a short period around the time of the summer solstice .

Vertical sundials which do not face directly South ( in the northern hemisphere ) may receive significantly less than twelve hours of sunlight per day , depending on the direction they do face , and on the time of year . For example , a vertical dial that faces due East can tell time only in the morning hours ; in the afternoon , the sun does not shine on its face . Vertical dials that face due East or West are polar dials , which will be described below . Vertical dials that face North are uncommon , because they tell time only during the spring and summer , and do not show the midday hours except in tropical latitudes ( and even there , only around midsummer ) .

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders .

To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border . Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult , so builders always tried to use local resources . Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region .

As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 .

Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color .

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion .

In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird . The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England , which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall , an Elizabethan manor house in Essex , and dated to around 1575 .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_14755-15684-0-929","score":37.3994481149,"text":"Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species . Housing guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections , and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig . Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey , though some ( such as dogs or cats ) can be trained to accept them . Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits . Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage . However , as lagomorphs , rabbits have different nutritional requirements , so the two species can not be fed the same food . Rabbits may also harbor diseases ( such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella ) , to which guinea pigs are susceptible .

Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material .

Safer bedding materials made from hardwoods ( such as aspen ) , paper products , and corn cob materials are other alternatives . Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages ; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them , and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces , making it difficult to remove . After its cage has been cleaned , a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color .

Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century , through the experiments of Louis Pasteur , \u00c9mile Roux , and Robert Koch . Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times , first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9 , 1961 -- with a successful recovery .

They do not respond well to sudden changes in their diet and they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types . A constant supply of hay is generally recommended , as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop bad habits if food is not present , such as chewing on their hair .

With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders . Once the Xiongnu were chased away , Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_7770-9663-0-1893","score":30.8134758445,"text":"Great Wall of China\nKing Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty ( `` Qin Shi Huang '' ) in 221 BC . Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords , he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states . To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border . Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult , so builders always tried to use local resources . Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_1580-2418-0-838","score":30.7818672761,"text":"Great Wall of China\nThe Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone , brick , tamped earth , wood , and other materials , generally built along an east - to - west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe with an eye to expansion .

However , as highlighted by Inhorn the overarching conceptualisation of infertility , to a great extent , disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context , both demographically and epidemiological and moreover , that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction . An important factor , argues Inhorn , is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health , whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility , men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility , as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies . This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts for more than half of all cases of infertility and moreover , it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples . For example , Inhorn notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment ; this continues to occur , even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women . Inhorn states that infertility often leads to `` marital demise , physical violence , emotional abuse , social exclusion , community exile , ineffective and iatrogenic therapies , poverty , old age insecurity , increased risk of HIV \/ AIDS , and death '' Significantly , Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon can not simply be explained by a lack of knowledge , rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society , whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness .","title":"Infertility","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.3333333333,"recall_3":0.3333333333,"recall_5":0.6666666667,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.469278726,"ndcg_cut_5":0.6713860725,"ndcg_cut_10":0.8278123145}}

Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this . However , casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because , at the time , Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through , in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years . CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract , which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously , traveling back - and - forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks .

Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords , he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states . To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border . Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult , so builders always tried to use local resources . Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_191-787-0-560","score":33.3548363344,"text":"Great Wall of China\nGreat Wall of China \u842c\u91cc \u9577\u57ce The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling Map of all the wall constructions General information Type Fortification Country China Coordinates 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Coordinates : 40 \u00b0 41 \u2032 N 117 \u00b0 14 \u2032 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 40.68 \u00b0 N 117.23 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 40.68 ; 117.23 Technical details Size 21,196 km ( 13,171 mi ) UNESCO World Heritage Site Official name The Great Wall Type Cultural Criteria i , ii , iii , iv , vi Designated 1987 ( 11th session ) Reference no . 438 State Party China Region Asia - Pacific","title":"Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"801328598_72745-74050-0-1299","score":32.4197450262,"text":"History of the Great Wall of China\nDespite the significance that the Great Wall seemed to have , scholarly treatment of the Wall itself remained scant during the 20th century .

'' In 1990 , Arthur Waldron published the influential The Great Wall : From History to Myth , where he challenged the notion of a unitary Great Wall maintained since antiquity , dismissing it as a modern myth . Waldron 's approach prompted a re-examination of the Wall in Western scholarship . Still , as of 2008 , there is not yet a full authoritative text in any language that is devoted to the Great Wall . The reason for this , according to The New Yorker journalist Peter Hessler , is that the Great Wall fits into neither the study of political institutions ( favoured by Chinese historians ) nor the excavation of tombs ( favoured by Chinese archeologists ) .

The Indian worm - gear roller gin , invented some time around the sixteenth century , has , according to Lakwete , remained virtually unchanged up to the present time . A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor Eli Whitney in 1793 and patented in 1794 . Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased . The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War .

Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market .

Charter townships can opt to use county - wide services instead , such as deputies from the county sheriff 's office instead of a home - based force of ordinance officers .","title":"Michigan","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"866460739_18326-18770-0-444","score":26.3041235127,"text":"Rick and Morty\nThe show is available to watch on Netflix in a number of countries outside the United States , including the United Kingdom and Australia , while the first two seasons are available to stream on Hulu .

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV . Games use the Accelerometer and Gyroscope along with the touchpad found on the Siri Remote for control . External Bluetooth Game controllers : ( such as the SteelSeries Nimbus , or the HORIPAD ULTIMATE Wireless Gaming Controller ) can also be paired .","title":"Apple TV","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846596030_46911-47635-0-724","score":25.2275936386,"text":"SpongeBob SquarePants\nIn 2012 , however , it was reported that the series ' ratings were declining .

The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1925 set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram , and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections .

In birds and mammals , bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis . It is composed of hematopoietic cells , marrow adipose tissue , and supportive stromal cells . On average , bone marrow constitutes 4 % of the total body mass of humans ; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass ( 143 lb ) , bone marrow typically accounts for approximately 2.6 kilograms ( 5.7 lb ) . Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day , which join the systemic circulation via permeable vasculature sinusoids within the medullary cavity .

For example , a newborn baby 's bones exclusively contain hematopoietically active `` red '' marrow , and there is a progressive conversion towards `` yellow '' marrow with age .

Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops , but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation . The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks . Marine pilots , like all aviators , fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority ; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops . On the other hand , the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own . Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces ; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield . The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards ahead . In 1944 , after considerable internal acrimony , Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out . At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party ( ALP ) not only requested air support , but actually directed it in tactical detail . The Marine formula increased responsiveness , reduced `` friendly '' casualties , and ( flying weather permitting ) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery .

By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons . Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops , but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation . The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks . Marine pilots , like all aviators , fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority ; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops . On the other hand , the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own . Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces ; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield . The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards ahead . In 1944 , after considerable internal acrimony , Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out . At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party ( ALP ) not only requested air support , but actually directed it in tactical detail . The Marine formula increased responsiveness , reduced `` friendly '' casualties , and ( flying weather permitting ) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery . For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation , provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed - wing fighters or bombers , although the Army was allowed to have some unarmed transports and spotter planes .

It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise , and the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) considers it to be one of the `` most important championships available to the sport '' . Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . After a series of league mergers and folds , it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 .","title":"Stanley Cup","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"807294979_70815-71424-0-609","score":41.0795710759,"text":"Arizona\nCollege sports are also prevalent in Arizona .

Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted .

In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom .

The late antiquity historian Ammianus Marcellinus ( 330 ? -- 395 ? ) mentioned `` summits of lofty walls '' enclosing the land of Seres , the country that the Romans believed to be at the eastern end of the Silk Road . In legend , the tribes of Gog and Magog were said to have been locked out by Alexander the Great with walls of steel . Later Arab writers and travellers , such as Rashid - al - Din Hamadani ( 1248 -- 1318 ) and Ibn Battuta ( 1304 -- 1377 ) , would erroneously identify the Great Wall in China with the walls of the Alexander romances . Soon after Europeans reached Ming China in the early 16th century , accounts of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe , even though no European would see it with their own eyes for another century . The work A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions by Gaspar da Cruz ( c. 1520 -- 70 ) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted , `` a Wall of an hundred leagues in length . And some will affirme to bee more than a hundred leagues . '' Another early account written by Bishop Juan Gonz\u00e1lez de Mendoza ( 1550 -- 1620 ) reported a wall five hundred leagues long , but suggested that only one hundred leagues were man - made , with the rest natural rock formations . The Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci ( 1552 -- 1610 ) mentioned the Great Wall once in his diary , noting the existence of `` a tremendous wall four hundred and five miles long '' that formed part of the northern defences of the Ming Empire .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_5967-6843-0-835","score":30.1474509172,"text":"Great Wall of China\nBecause of the wall 's association with the First Emperor 's supposed tyranny , the Chinese dynasties after Qin usually avoided referring to their own additions to the wall by the name `` Long Wall '' .

During the 1933 defence of the Great Wall , inadequately - equipped Chinese soldiers held off double their number of Japanese troops for several months . Using the cover of the Great Wall , the Chinese -- who were at times only armed with broadswords -- were able to beat off a Japanese advance that had the support of aerial bombardment . With the Chinese forces eventually overrun , the subsequent Tanggu Truce stipulated that the Great Wall was to become a demilitarized zone separating China and the newly created Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo . Even so , the determined defence of the Great Wall made it a symbol of Chinese patriotism and the resoluteness of the Chinese people . The Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong picked up this symbol in his poetry during his `` Long March '' escaping from Kuomintang prosecution . Near the end of the trek in 1935 , Mao wrote the poem `` Mount Liupan '' that contains the well - known line that would be carved in stone along the Great Wall in the present day : `` Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men '' ( \u4e0d \u5230 \u957f\u57ce \u975e \u597d\u6c49 ) . Another noteworthy reference to the Great Wall is in the song `` The March of the Volunteers '' , whose words came from a stanza in Tian Han 's 1934 poem entitled `` The Great Wall '' .
