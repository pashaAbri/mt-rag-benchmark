To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02855-30099-31664","score":16.964842,"text":"\n}\nconst token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.YOUR_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256', expiresIn: '10000ms' });\nreturn token;\n}\n\nShow more\n3.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14916-7-2291","score":22.867838,"text":"\nOverview \n\nUse IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud to create your own space in IBM Cloud\u00ae.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans. Plans cannot themselves have their own version, they use the version of their parent Product.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-about_apic_overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-3313-5682","score":15.976576,"text":"\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00550-7-2005","score":23.017904,"text":"\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_09557-7-2255","score":22.818733,"text":"\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-25421-27357","score":22.455576,"text":"\nType acurl $URL\/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/home\/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03824-7-1809","score":19.231289,"text":"\nKubernetes \n\nThe IBM Blockchain Platform allows you to provision blockchain components into your Kubernetes cluster.

You want to protect your data to help ensure it's secure, available, and maintains integrity. IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae provides several ways to protect your data and help keep your applications operational.\n\nSome of these protection features are automatic.

You are responsible for your data backup, and associated recovery of your content.\n\nThis document provides an overview of the automatic capabilities and supported tools that are offered by IBM Cloudant.\n\n\n\n Types and levels of protection \n\nThe type of protection you might want depends on the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nFor example, you might want to have a high level of data availability so that you can still access your data, even if a limited amount of hardware within the system failed. This requirement is necessary for \"High Availability\" (HA). It means that you provide the best possible continuous data availability after a hardware failure. Different HA techniques tolerate different levels of failure before operations are affected.\n\nYou might want to have quick and easy ways of backing up and restoring data. For example, after a severe or extensive hardware failure, you want the ability to make all the data available on an alternative system as quickly as possible. This requirement is necessary for \"Disaster Recovery\" (DR). A disaster generally means that a database is no longer available in one or more locations. For example, a power outage might cause all systems in a database cluster to fail. Or a large-scale network failure might mean systems in a cluster can't be contacted, even though they continue to work correctly.\n\nAddressing your HA or DR requirements often begins by simplifying the problem into more generic requirements. When you identify your requirements, you can apply the tools and features that help solve the generic needs. Together, the tools and features can address your HA or DR requirements.\n\nDifferent tools and features provide different levels of protection. The different features might be more or less suitable for your specific HA or DR requirement.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-disaster-recovery-and-backup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00542-6107-8245","score":21.359312,"text":"\nCertification details and attestation reports (that is, ISO and SOC2) can be provided to the customer upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Technical and Organizational Measures \n\nTechnical and Organizational Measures (TOMs) are employed by IBM Cloudant to ensure the security of Personal Data.

Click the Dialog tab, and then click Create dialog.\n\nWhen you open the dialog editor for the first time, the following nodes are created for you:\n\n\n\n* Welcome: The first node. It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs that are deployed in environments such as messaging channels where customers start the conversation do not process nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\n2.

In the If assistant recognizes field, enter a condition that, when met, triggers your assistant to process the node.\n\nTo start off, you typically want to add an intent as the condition. For example, if you add open_account here, it means that you want the response that you will specify in this node to be returned to the user if the user input indicates that the user wants to open an account.\n\nAs you begin to define a condition, a box is displayed that shows you your options. You can enter one of the following characters, and then pick a value from the list of options that is displayed.\n\n\n\nCondition builder syntax\n\n Character Lists defined values for these artifact types \n\n `#` intents","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_02952-1632-3754","score":18.586548,"text":"\nCreate an intent that can recognize when a customer asks to speak to someone. After defining the intent, you can add a root-level dialog node that conditions on the intent. As the dialog node response, add a Connect to human agent response type. At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person. Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request. Instead of asking the customer to retry or rephrase the question over and over, your assistant can offer to transfer the customer to a human agent.\n\n\n\nTo design a dialog that can transfer the conversation, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2. Add a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step.

Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it. To ensure that a useful summary is provided to service desk agents when a conversation is transferred to them, add short dialog node names that reflect the node's purpose. For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-support"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03185-6701-8694","score":18.270763,"text":"\n[A sample dialog tree with example content](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/dialog-depiction-full.png)\n\nThe dialog tree in this diagram contains two root dialog nodes. A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03113-4-2033","score":18.136242,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

You can use the \/dialog_nodes API to create, delete, or modify dialog nodes.\n\nRemember that the dialog is a tree of interconnected nodes, and that it must conform to certain rules in order to be valid. This means that any change you make to a dialog node might have cascading effects on other nodes, or on the structure of your dialog. Before using the \/dialog_nodes API to modify your dialog, make sure you understand how your changes will affect the rest of the dialog.

See [Downloading a skill](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-tasksskill-tasks-download) for details.\n\nA valid dialog always satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* Each dialog node has a unique ID (the dialog_node property).\n* A child node is aware of its parent node (the parent property). However, a parent node is not aware of its children.\n* A node is aware of its immediate previous sibling, if any (the previous_sibling property). This means that all siblings that share the same parent form a linked list, with each node pointing to the previous node.\n* Only one child of a given parent can be the first sibling (meaning that its previous_sibling is null).\n* A node cannot point to a previous sibling that is a child of a different parent.\n* Two nodes cannot point to the same previous sibling.\n* A node can specify another node that is to be executed next (the next_step property).\n* A node cannot be its own parent or its own sibling.\n* A node must have a type property that contains one of the following values. If no type property is specified, then the type is standard.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-api-dialog-modify"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03113-6206-7586","score":18.09863,"text":"\n[Example dialog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/dialog_api_1.png)\n\nWe can create a new node by making a POST request to \/dialog_nodes with the following body:\n\n{\n\"dialog_node\": \"node_8\"\n}\n\nThe dialog now looks like this:\n\n![Example dialog 2](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8\/assistant\/images\/dialog_api_2.png)\n\nBecause node_8 was created without specifying a value for parent or previous_sibling, it is now the first node in the dialog.

This is beneficial because you can add multiple accounts to an enterprise and organize them as needed into account groups, but keep the user lists restricted from other accounts.\n\nIn most cases, you want to add only the users to your enterprise account that need the ability to manage the enterprise. Depending on the role the user is assigned on the [Enterprise account management service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management), they have varying levels of access for managing the enterprise. For example, a user assigned the Administrator role on the Enterprise service can rename the enterprise, update the domain, view usage, create accounts, and more. However, a user with the viewer or operator role is limited to viewing the accounts and account groups hierarchy for the enterprise.\n\nInviting users to the enterprise account doesn't provide access to manage any of the child accounts within the enterprise or their resources.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16295-7-1721","score":20.551758,"text":"\nEmbedding the web chat on your page \n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source.\n\nThe web chat integration is automatically included for every assistant, and is configured separately for each environment.\n\nTo add the web chat to your website, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.

IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS Edition is being replaced by IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric!! IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS Edition will no longer be supported after July 31, 2023. Customers have been directed to migrate their networks by July 31, 2023. After this date, IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS networks that are not migrated to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric will be at risk for potential security vulnerabilities. A migration tool is provided from your console, and the disruption to your network is minimal. See [Migrating to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-migrating-to-hlf-support) for details.\n\nThis guide helps you understand the pricing model for IBM\u00ae Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud, and how much you will pay when you develop and grow your blockchain network of peers, ordering nodes, and Certificate Authorities components, which are based on Hyperledger Fabric v2.2.10.\n\n\n\n Pricing model \n\nIBM Blockchain Platform introduces a new hourly pricing model that is based on virtual processor core (VPC) allocation. This simplified model is based on the amount of CPU (or VPC) that your IBM Blockchain Platform nodes are allocated on an hourly basis, at a flat rate of $0.29 USD\/VPC-hour.\n\nA VPC is a unit of measurement that is used to determine the licensing cost of IBM products. It is based on the number of virtual cores (vCPUs) that are available to the product. A vCPU is a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual machine or a physical processor core. For IBM Blockchain Platform cost estimation purposes, 1 VPC = 1 CPU = 1 vCPU = 1 Core. The term \"VPC\" is also used to refer to a type of infrastructure on IBM Cloud and is unrelated to this topic.\n\nFor a total cost estimate, remember that your blockchain network consists of an Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud that contains IBM Blockchain Platform components and uses storage of your choice. Your Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud and the storage that you choose incur separate charges.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-saas-pricing"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04031-6179-7910","score":18.750765,"text":"\n[Elements of pricing](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/c5288bed34c3820e3a5251d820ee91adcd2591a3\/blockchain\/images\/elements-of-pricing.svg)\n\nFigure 1. Elements of pricing\n\n\n\n* IBM Blockchain Platform: Based on a flat rate of $0.29 USD\/VPC-hour. This fee represents the charge for your blockchain component VPC allocation in your Kubernetes cluster.\n* IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: While you can link your IBM Blockchain Platform service instance to either an IBM Cloud Kubernetes service cluster or an OpenShift cluster, this pricing model is based on the usage of an IBM Cloud Kubernetes service cluster. The IBM Cloud Kubernetes service uses a tiered pricing model that is visible in IBM Cloud when you provision your paid cluster. This includes the charges for your compute, that is, CPU and memory. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Services are priced on a tiered model that is based on the number of hours of usage per month. Therefore, when you examine pricing plans, consider that 24x7 usage is equivalent to 720 hours per month. Refer to the table on the [Kubernetes Service Catalog page](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/kubernetes\/catalog\/about) for more details on cluster pricing. Customers who are interested in pricing OpenShift clusters can review [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Pricing](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/openshift\/pricing).\n* Storage: Choose the storage plan that works for your needs. See [Understanding Kubernetes storage basics](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/containers?topic=containers-kube_conceptskube_concepts) to learn more about your storage class options and how much they [cost](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud\/file-storage\/pricing).

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

For this, you must attach the data files in your object storage bucket to Presto.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos:\/\/us-geo\/sql\/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

Run the following command to create schema for the data you want to access.\n\nCREATE SCHEMA <SCHEMA_NAME> WITH ( location = '<SCHEMA_LOCATION>' );\n\nFor example:\n\nCREATE SCHEMA hive.gosales WITH ( location = 's3a:\/\/lhbeta\/gosales' );\n2.

A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active\/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active\/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03107-5127-7134","score":16.426796,"text":"\n* conversation_id (v1 API only): A property defined in the v1 API that is stored in the context object of a \/message API call.

Otherwise, a new ID is generated for each new \/message API call.\n\n\n\nFor example, if the same person chats with your assistant on three separate occasions over the same billing period, how you represent that user in the API call impacts how the interactions are billed.

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word \u201cimmutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption. When enable and two backup infrastructure components need to communicate, a dynamic key is generated by the backup server and communicated to each node over a secure channel.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeam-cr-sa-lhr"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04939-64122-65726","score":8.675021,"text":"\nSystem.out.printf(\"New retention period on %s is %sn\", objectName, additionalSeconds);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n List legal holds on a protected object \n\nThis operation returns:\n\n\n\n* Object creation date\n* Object retention period in seconds\n* Calculated retention expiration date based on the period and creation date\n* List of legal holds\n* Legal hold identifier\n* Timestamp when legal hold was applied\n\n\n\nIf there are no legal holds on the object, an empty LegalHoldSet is returned.

Both of those tools have idle time, waiting for inbound user requests, and you are billed for all that \u201csleeping\u201d time.\n\nFull web application can be built and run with Cloud Functions. Combining serverless APIs with static file hosting for site resources such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, means that you can build entirely serverless web applications. The simplicity of operating a hosted Cloud Functions environment is not having to operate anything at all. Since Cloud Functions is hosted on IBM Cloud, it is a great benefit when compared to standing up, and operating a Node.js Express or other traditional server runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n IoT \n\nInternet of Things scenarios are often inherently sensor-driven. For example, an action in Cloud Functions might be triggered if a need to react to a sensor that exceeds a specific temperature. IoT interactions are usually stateless with the potential of high load in major spontaneous events such as natural disasters, significant weather storms, or traffic jams. A need is created for an elastic system where normal workload might be small, but needs to scale quickly with predictable response time. So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":1.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per core, such as 10. - Avoid node overload: Similarly, just because a node can contain more than 100 pods doesn't mean that you want it to. Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per node, such as 40. - Don't tap out your cluster bandwidth**: Keep in mind that network bandwidth on scaling virtual machines is around 1000 Mbps. If you need hundreds of worker nodes in a cluster, split it up into multiple clusters with fewer nodes, or order bare metal nodes. - Sorting out your services: Plan out how many services that you need for your workload before you deploy.

BFD also provides a way for network administrators to detect forwarding-path failures at a uniform rate, rather than the variable rates of different routing protocol hello mechanisms.

Also known as orderer. These blocks are then distributed to peers, which then verify the blocks and add them to the ledgers on each channel. Ordering nodes contain the cryptographic identity material that is tied to each member and authenticate the identity of clients and peers to access the network. The overall function that an ordering node or collection of nodes provides is known as the ordering service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Organization \n\nSee [Member](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-glossaryglossary-member).\n\n\n\n\n\n Out of band \n\nAn expression used to refer to sharing network artifacts outside of the console UI, for example by email or some other file transfer mechanism.

The peer runs smart contract and is the holder of transaction history and the current state of assets on ledgers. They are owned and managed by organizations and are joined to channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n Propose \n\nReferring to a step in the Hyperledger Fabric v2.x smart contract lifecycle, a smart contract definition is proposed to a channel for approval by the organizations that are specified in the channel lifecycle endorsement policy. A smart contract proposal contains a smart contract definition name, version, package, endorsement policy, and optionally a private data collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quorum \n\nIn a Raft ordering service, a quorum represents the number of nodes that must be available for transactions to be processed. This number is a majority of the total number of nodes in the consenter set of the channel. In other words, if you have one node, you need that node available to have a quorum, because the majority of one is one.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-glossary"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03837-3210-5419","score":14.299276,"text":"\nCertificate Authorities (CAs) \n\nYou can think of a blockchain network as a series of managed interactions between nodes to serve a defined business use case. For these interactions to be verifiable (to ensure, in other words, who is who) requires identities and a system of permissions that can be checked during each interaction. You can think of the kind of identity that is needed as being similar to a credit card in that it identifies someone within a particular context. Credit cards identify an individual in terms of banking transactions, while Fabric identities allow users to be identified in a blockchain context.\n\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, as well as the IBM Blockchain Platform, this component is the Certificate Authority (CA), which creates identities in the form of x509 certificates as well defining of an organization through the creation of a Membership Services Provider (MSP), which defines the permissions of identities at a component and channel level. These identities can include attributes about them, for example, by linking them to a particular organization or organizational unit (OU).\n\nAn organization MSP, for example, has an MSP subfolder called admins. Any user whose certificate is inside that admin folder is an admin of the organization. Because this MSP defines the organization, it is listed in the configuration on every channel of which the organization is a member. As a result, whenever an admin of the organization tries to perform an action, the signing certificate of the admin (which is attached to all of its interactions) is checked against the certificates listed in the MSP. Does the certificate match the one listed in the channel configuration? If it does, the other organizations will validate it and the action can be performed. If not, the request to execute the transaction is rejected.\n\nIBM Blockchain Platform CAs are based on the [Hyperledger Fabric CA](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-1.4\/), though it is possible to use another CA if it uses a PKI based on x.509 certificates. Because non-Fabric CAs are not configured to create properly formatted MSPs, users who want to use this kind of CA must create the MSP for themselves.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-blockchain-component-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03884-3713-6160","score":14.164826,"text":"\nConsenter set \n\nThe ordering service nodes actively participating in the ordering process on a channel.

The following lines do not apply to orderers that do not use a system channel: These are the only organizations that can create channels. At channel creation time, all organizations added to the channel must be part of a consortium. However, an organization that is not defined in a consortium may be added to an existing channel. While a blockchain network can have multiple consortia, most blockchain networks have a single consortium.\n\n\n\n\n\n CouchDB \n\nA document store that can be used as the state database of your peers. Using CouchDB allows you to use rich queries and deploy indexes with your smart contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n Current state \n\nThe current state of the ledger represents the latest values for all keys that are ever included in its chain transaction log. Because current state represents all latest key values known to the channel, it is sometimes referred to as the world state. Smart contracts execute transaction proposals against current state data. The current state changes every time when the value of a key changes or a new key is added and is critical to a transaction flow because the latest key-value pair must be known before it can be changed. Peers commit the latest values to the current state of the ledger for each valid transaction in a block. The current state is stored the state database associated with a peer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dynamic membership \n\nA member can be dynamically added to the network by a user with registrar privilege. Members are also assigned roles and attributes, which control their access and authority on the network. Neither roles nor attributes can be assigned dynamically though.

It is important to understand though that when you register other node admin or client application identities with a CA by using the console, their private keys are not stored inside the HSM because they will need their private key to transact on the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations when using HSM \n\n\n\n* When you configure your HSM, you will create a partition and a PIN for the slot on the HSM.\n* A single partition can be used to generate and store multiple keys.\n* Multiple blockchain nodes can share an HSM configuration, however it is recommended that one HSM is configured per organization.\n* An HSM is not configured for an ordering service. Rather it is configured at the ordering node level inside the ordering service. Consider the case when different organizations contribute ordering nodes to an ordering service, it is possible that some organizations may want to use an HSM for the private key for their ordering node, while other organizations may not have that requirement. But all of the ordering nodes can still function together in the ordering service nonetheless.\n* The use of an HSM introduces an increase in transaction processing, therefore you can expect a performance hit when using an HSM to manage the private keys for your nodes.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-adv-deployment"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03869-2913-5047","score":13.365734,"text":"\nLedgers themselves contain two distinct, though related, parts: a world state which records the current value of any key (such as an asset), and a blockchain which contains a literal \u201cchain of blocks\u201d that contain the records of each transaction. Peers receive state updates in the form of new blocks from the ordering service. They then use the blocks and the world state to confirm (or commit) transactions, update the world state and add the log of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nOrdering nodes form a Raft ordering cluster that comprises the ordering service of a channel. The ordering service literally \u201corders\u201d transactions into blocks that are sent to peers to be committed to their ledgers. Each ordering node stores a copy of the blockchain portion of the channel ledger.\n\nChannels are the place where organizations interact within a network. You cannot participate in a blockchain network without joining a channel. Channels can be used by members of the network to create logical separation between business applications and even to boost performance by limiting traffic. They can also be used by subsets of organizations in the consortium to transact privately and separate data.\n\nPeers maintain a separate ledger for each channel that they join. Only organizations that are members of the channel can join their peers to the channel and receive ledger updates from the ordering service. As a result, each channel is bound to an ordering service, which stores the blockchain portion of every channel ledger that it maintains. Client applications submit transactions to the peers and ordering service of a given channel. These transactions are added to the transaction log within the blockchain and include a [read-write set](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.2\/readwrite.html) that is used to update the key-value pairs in the world state.\n\nIf in-country data residency is a requirement, you need to consider the location of your peers and the ordering service, as well as your client applications. You also need to know the location of the peers that belong to other organizations on your channels.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-console-icp-about-data-residency"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03921-40588-42624","score":13.300771,"text":"\nStep two: Create the ordering service \n\nIn other distributed blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, there is no central authority that orders transactions and sends them out to peers. Hyperledger Fabric, the blockchain that the IBM Blockchain Platform is based on, works differently. It features a node, or a cluster of nodes, called an ordering service.\n\nThe ordering service is a key component in a network because it performs a few essential functions:\n\n\n\n* It literally orders the blocks of transactions that are sent to the peers to be written to their ledgers. This process is called \"ordering\".\n* On orderers with a system channel, it maintains the consortium, the list of peer organizations permitted to create channels, resides.\n* It enforces the policies decided by the consortium or the channel administrators. These policies dictate everything from who gets to read or write to a channel, to who can create or modify a channel. For example, when a network participant asks to modify a channel or consortium policy, the ordering service processes the request to see if the participant has the proper administrative rights for that configuration update, validates it against the existing configuration, generates a new configuration, and relays it to the peers.\n\n\n\nFor more information about ordering services and the role they play in networks based on Hyperledger Fabric, see [The Ordering Service](https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.2\/orderer\/ordering_service.html).\n\nIn a paid cluster, you have the option between creating a one node ordering service (sufficient for testing purposes) and a crash fault tolerant ordering service featuring five nodes tied to a single organization. In a free cluster, you will only be able to create a single node ordering service. In this tutorial, we will show the one node ordering service.\n\nHowever, just as with the peer, before we can create an ordering service, we need to create a CA to supply the identities and the MSP of our ordering service organization.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04085-7-1799","score":13.290934,"text":"\nKubernetes \n\nThe IBM Blockchain Platform allows you to provision blockchain components into your Kubernetes cluster.

The following guidelines (Landis and Koch, 1977) provide a starting point for assessing overall performance.\n\nTable 1: Inter-annotator Guidelines\n\n\n\n Score Agreement level \n\n <0 Poor \n .01 - .20 Slight \n .21 - .40 Fair \n .41 - .60 Moderate \n .61 - .80 Substantial \n .81 - 1.0 Perfect \n\n\n\nThe score in the other columns is an F1 measure. It represents the level of annotation consistency between a pair of human annotators. The value can range from 0 to 1, where perfect agreement is indicated by the score 1. What constitutes an acceptable level of agreement depends on your domain data and type system. But to provide an example, here are the F1 thresholds that project managers expect to be met or exceeded in projects that are based on the KLUE type system:\n\n\n\n* Mentions with entity types: 0.85\n* Relations: 0.8\n* Coreference chains: 0.9\n\n\n\nInterpreting the scores depends on the complexity of your type system, the amount and complexity of the content annotated, how experienced the human annotators are, and other factors. For example, if the annotation task is focused on labeling parts of speech, you might expect to see a high score because of how well-defined the parts of speech are. But a task that requires deeper analysis of the text, where human interpretation is required, might show lower scores until you take steps to clarify the causes of the ambiguity.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-build-groundtruth"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16425-3435-5660","score":16.963985,"text":"\nA measurement of ground truth that shows the number of words that were annotated with a given entity type or relation type out of the total number of words, whether annotated or unannotated.

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-3403-5572","score":19.888796,"text":"\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04105-7-2225","score":14.373378,"text":"\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16280-4696-6712","score":15.852309,"text":"\nYou can configure how and where the web chat widget appears, and you can use theming to align it with your branding and website design.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03421-1518-3290","score":15.750232,"text":"\nIf you want to make more advanced customizations, you can make the following types of changes:\n\n\n\n* Change the launcher icon that is used to open the web chat widget.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions. A common table expression permits defining a result table with a table name that can be specified as a table name in any FROM clause of the fullselect that follows.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-reference"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16353-2640-4846","score":13.781716,"text":"\nYou can select any step that precedes the step you are editing.\n\nNote that only the selected steps will repeat, regardless of their And then settings. Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3. Click Apply.\n\n\n\nAny session variable values that were defined based on choices that the customer made in the repeated steps are cleared and replaced with the new responses.\n\nThere is no option to jump to a later step. Instead of jumping directly to a later step, control the flow through the intervening steps with step conditions or skipping steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n Go to a subaction \n\nAn action that is called from another action is referred to as a subaction. This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it. For example, as part of an action to place an order, you might call a subaction that enables a new customer to create an account.\n\nTo call a subaction:\n\n\n\n1.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance.

When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance.

Using subnet and VLAN networking in one pod works well until you must scale up or have large virtual resource demands that require resources to be created between pods. (Adding appliances for VLAN spanning can get expensive and complicated!)\n\nIBM Cloud VPC adds a network orchestration layer that eliminates the pod boundary, creating increased capacity for scaling instances. The network orchestration layer handles all of the networking for all virtual server instances that are within a VPC across regions and zones.

After the VPC is provisioned, the scripts use the Ansible Playbook to install the SAP system.\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud\u00ae VPC introduction \n\nA VPC is a public cloud offering that an enterprise uses to establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared [public cloud](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/cloud) infrastructure. VPCs give an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\n\nImagine that a cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure is a residential apartment building and multiple families live inside. Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium; no one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission.\n\nA VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic\/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to manually provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance. VPC infrastructure contains a number of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, including Virtual Servers for VPC. Use the following information to understand a simple use case for planning, creating, and configuring resources for your VPC, and learn about more VPC overviews and VPC tutorials.

The cost is based on the summary of three parts: the number of authentication events, the number of authorized users, and the number of advanced security events.\n\nFor example, if these quantities are in the 1 - 10,000 tier, the charge for each authentication event, authorized user, and advanced security event is assessed by multiplying each quantity by the unit price that is set for that tier.

These operators allow you to provision and manage File, Block, and Object storage for your containerized workloads in Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae clusters. Unlike other storage solutions where you might need to configure separate drivers and operators for each type of storage, ODF is a unified solution capable of adapting or scaling to your storage needs. You can also deploy ODF on any OCP cluster.\n\nHow does OpenShift Data Foundation work?\n: ODF uses storage volumes in multiples of 3 and replicates your app data across these volumes. The underlying storage volumes that you use for ODF depends on your cluster type. - For VPC clusters the storage volumes are dynamically provisioned Block Storage for VPC devices. - For bare metal Classic clusters, the storage volumes are local disks on your bare metal worker nodes. - For Satellite clusters, the storage volumes are either local disks on your worker nodes, or you can dynamically provision disks by using a compatible block storage driver.\n: ODF uses these devices to create a virtualized storage layer, where your app data is replicated for high availability. Because ODF abstracts your underlying storage, you can use ODF to create File, Block, or Object storage claims from the same underlying raw block storage.\n\nFor a full overview of the features and benefits, see [OpenShift Data Foundation](https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/technologies\/cloud-computing\/openshift-data-foundation).\n\n\n\n Architecture overview","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-ocs-storage-prep"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_10154-17039-18368","score":23.502663,"text":"\nContainer-native virtualization You can set up [container-native virtualization add-on](https:\/\/docs.openshift.com\/container-platform\/4.11\/virt\/about-virt.html) on bare metal machines, but not on virtual machines.

The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots.

For example, it is easier to recognize asbestos as a mineral entity type than to determine the entity type of squash, which can refer to a vegetable, a sport, or a verb meaning to crush something.\n\nDictionary pre-annotators do not recognize entity subtypes.

For larger clusters, use \/22 to have enough pod IP addresses for eight worker nodes, \/21 to have enough pod IP addresses for 16 worker nodes, and so on.\n: The subnet that you choose must be within one of the following ranges:\n\n\n\n* 172.17.0.0 - 172.17.255.255\n* 172.21.0.0 - 172.31.255.255\n* 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.254.255","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.2,"recall_5":0.2,"recall_10":0.2,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.234639363,"ndcg_cut_5":0.1695801026,"ndcg_cut_10":0.1695801026}}

From this tutorial, you learn how to create a basic website that interfaces with your IBM Cloud database to read and write data.\n\nThe project is a simple to-do list, where you can see a list of notes. You can add and delete notes. Each of your notes has a tag, and you can filter your notes by tag.\n2. To create this to-do list, your application needs to be able to read and write to the database. To read to-dos in \"newest first\" order and to filter by tag, your database needs to have some secondary indexes. Now, we can create all of that.\n\n\n\nYou can complete the tutorial in less than an hour. It doesn't cost you anything over your current IBM Cloudant bill (so it's free if you are on the IBM Cloudant Lite plan).\n\nThe website that you create is served from your local machine, so no other services are required apart from IBM Cloud.\n\nAfter you complete it, you have a basic understanding of how applications can interface with IBM Cloudant through an IBM Cloudant SDK (in this case, NodeJS).\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nYou need the following implements to complete this tutorial:\n\n\n\n1. An IBM Cloudant service instance and some service credentials. You can create the instance and credentials in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard by following the [Getting started with IBM Cloudant](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-getting-started-with-cloudant) tutorial.

In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3.

You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudant).

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03729-1672-3956","score":21.6912,"text":"\nServices For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume.

Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03776-5228-7163","score":21.23055,"text":"\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14905-7-2029","score":25.236948,"text":"\nAbout networking \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network that is linked to your customer account.

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16729-187656-189537","score":24.5882,"text":"\nA Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides network isolation and security in the IBM Cloud.

For example, you must keep up with browser support changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and design the layout and styling. The time you spend designing and maintaing a UI can be better spent building a quality assistant instead. When you use the web chat integration, you can rely on us to manage the user interface, so you can focus on designing conversational exchanges that address the unique business needs of your customers. Cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research is incorporated into the web chat to deliver an exceptional user experience.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy the web chat, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server. This capability allows you to decentralize the management of a large domain (such as ibm.com).\n\nA custom domain name server allows you to utilize the DNS provider's servers with the customized reference name of your own domain. For example, you can define your name server to be ns1.cloud.ibm.com instead of ns1.acme.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally 'sign' DNS data so you can be assured it is valid. To eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).\n\n\n\n\n\n Root record CNAME flattening \n\nIBM CIS supports a feature called \"CNAME Flattening.\" Using this method, root records can overcome the IETF RFC restriction that if a root record is a CNAME, it cannot have any other records for that domain.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-dns-concepts"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04195-6086-8151","score":22.449371,"text":"\nBecause CIS doesn't support email traffic by default, you must set the PTR record to the location of your email server.

Select Cancel if you don't want to delete.\n\n\n\n\n\n Importing and exporting DNS records \n\nDNS records can be imported into and exported from CIS. All files are imported and exported as .txt files in BIND format. Learn more about [BIND format](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zone_file). Click the overflow menu and select to import or export records.\n\nImport records - By default, a total of 3500 DNS records are allowed (imported and created on CIS). You can import multiple files, one at a time, as long as the total number of records is under the max limit. After importing, you are shown a summary with the number of records successfully added and the number that failed, along with the reason why each record failed.\n\nExport records - Use Export records to create a backup of your zone file, or export it to use with another DNS provider. When this menu option is clicked, the records are downloaded to the location specified by your browser settings (typically the Downloads folder). To select another folder location, change your browser's settings to prompt you for a location with each download.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring and managing your secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally sign DNS data so you can be assured it is valid.

This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00576-8941-10714","score":24.908142,"text":"\nThe maximum document size is 1 MB, but documents must be much smaller than that size, typically a few KB.\n\nFor more information, see the following blog posts:\n\n\n\n* [Optimal IBM Cloudant Indexing](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/05\/10\/Optimal-Cloudant-Indexing.html)\n* [Time-series Data Storage](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/04\/08\/Time-series-data-storage.html)\n* [Partitioned databases - data design](https:\/\/blog.cloudant.com\/2019\/03\/05\/Partition-Databases-Data-Design.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Making the most of the primary index \n\nIBM Cloudant has a primary index on the document's _id attribute. This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together.

In other words, changes might not appear in strict time order. The reason is that data is returned from multiple IBM Cloudant nodes, and eventual consistency rules apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication pitfalls \n\nTo replicate successfully, the sum of the document size and all attachment sizes must be less than the maximum request size of the target cluster. For example, if the maximum HTTP request size is 11 MB, then the following scenarios apply:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Various scenarios based on maximum HTTP request size 11 MB\n\n Document size Attachment size Total size Replicates? \n\n 1 MB Five 2-MB attachments 11 MB Yes \n 1 MB One 10-MB attachment 11 MB Yes \n 1 MB One hundred 1-MB attachments 101 MB No \n\n\n\nSeveral considerations apply when you use replication.\n\n\n\n Incorrect user permissions \n\nFor replication to proceed optimally when you replicate from database \"a\" to database \"b\", the credentials that are supplied must have:\n\n\n\n* _reader and _replicator permissions on database \"a\".\n* _writer permissions on database \"b\".\n\n\n\nAPI keys are generated in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard or through the [API](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudant). Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted. The _replicator document records the current state of the replication process. In an extreme case, the document can become huge because it contains many unresolved conflicts.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-guide"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":0.0,"recall_5":0.0,"recall_10":0.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.0,"ndcg_cut_5":0.0,"ndcg_cut_10":0.0}}

For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-language"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16374-0-2178","score":15.557003,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Supporting global audiences \n\nYou can build an assistant that understands customer messages in any of the languages that are supported by the service. The responses from your assistant are defined by you and can be written in any language you want.\n\nHowever, some of the phrases that are displayed in the web chat widget are part of the web chat itself and do not come from the assistant. By default, these hardcoded phrases are specified in English, but you can apply a different language by adding lines to the embedded web chat script.\n\nThe hardcoded phrases used by the web chat widget are specified in language pack files. The web chat provides language packs that contain translations of each English-language phrase that is used by the web chat. You can instruct the web chat to use one of these other languages files by using the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nLikewise, the web chat applies an American English locale to content that is added by the web chat unless you specify something else. The locale setting affects how values such as dates and times are formatted.\n\nTo configure the web chat for customers outside the US, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.  To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":19.817444,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

If the device goes offline in the middle of a conversation, appropriate error messages and retries occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a JavaScript bridge \n\nIn some situations, your mobile application might need to communicate with the Watson Assistant web chat. For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16334-20193-22029","score":18.777273,"text":"\n* \"User is typing\" support: The web chat now supports displaying the \"user is typing\" message for service desks.

Checklist for planning backup policies\n\n Item Considerations \n\n Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) Evaluate your [IAM access permissions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-managebaas-vpc-iam) to create and manage backups. \n Volumes Evaluate which volumes are most important to back up. You can create backups of boot and data volumes. A volume with numerous changes and a lengthy retention period requires more attention than a volume with moderate changes. Also, the cumulative size of all backups for a volume can't exceed 10 TB. \n Backup schedule Determine a backup schedule based on the type of volumes that you're backing up. For example, you might want to back up critical data that changes frequently more often than static data. \n Retention Determine a retention policy for backups in the backup plan. As subsequent backups are created, keep in mind that you incur costs for each backup that you retain. Deleting older backups keeps costs down. \n Backup plans Decide on the number of backup plans that you need for a policy. For example, you can have separate plans for daily backups, weekly, and monthly. \n Interface Choose the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform for creating and managing your backups. \n Billing Think about the number of backup snapshots that you want to take and other [billing considerations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about&interface=apisnapshots_vpc_considerations) as the number of backup snapshots grows. \n Volume restore Evaluate when you might want to restore a volume from a backup.

In the event of a disaster, consumers depend on service being restored quickly without loss of data. Using the VPC reference architecture and following the controls of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services help you achieve that goal. When building a BCDR solution in IBM Cloud, you need to consider your workloads that run in virtual servers or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud and the BCDR characteristics of all of the other IBM Cloud services your solution depends on.\n\n\n\n Requirements \n\nThe following sections describe some of the requirements that you must follow for BCDR of your workloads.\n\n\n\n Alternative storage site \n\nYou must establish and configure an alternative storage site in at least one geographically separate IBM Cloud multizone region.

It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04107-9120-10897","score":18.215834,"text":"\nCIS WAF contains rulesets to mitigate non-volumetric attacks, including cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-11574-13329","score":22.919592,"text":"\nAnyone who has these IDs could use them to send messages to your assistant and receive its replies.

This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

Ignition is a first boot installer and configuration tool that is designed specifically for CoreOS Container Linux to partition disks, format partitions, writing files and configuring users. On first boot, Ignition reads its configuration from a remote URL and applies the configuration to the VM.\n* Terraform - Terraform is a tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files. It uses a \"provider\" to interact with the infrastructure. A .tf file is used to describe the infrastructure as code. A .tvars file is used to store the variables for the deployment. The main.tf file holds the build instructions.\n* PowerShell is used on the AD DNS server to create the DNS entries.\n* PowerShell Core is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.

Using a promise allows you to return the object from a synchronous function immediately, but the actual result becomes available at a later point in time, when the promise is fulfilled.\n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions Node.js runtime container supports promises that are returned from the main() function. If you prefer working in a more synchronous fashion, you can also declare your main() function as an async function, which allows you to wait for asynchronous calls to complete before the function continues.\n\nExamples:\n\nfunction main() {\nreturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n...doGet(callback => {\nresolve(); \/\/ <-- this terminates action execution, as the Promise got resolved\n});\n...\ntry {\n...some synchronous code...\n} catch(e) {\n...log error...\nreject(e); \/\/ <-- this also terminates the execution, but reports the failure back to the runtime\n}\n});\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n...some synchronous code...\nawait doGet(....)","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-ts_action_nodejs_fails"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00644-14024-16089","score":16.011833,"text":"\nWhile IBM Cloudant strives to keep indexes updated in the background, no guarantee exists about how out-of-date the view is when queried with update=false or update=lazy.\n\nThe stable option indicates whether you would prefer to get results from a single, consistent set of shards. The false value means that all available shard replicas are queried and IBM Cloudant uses the fastest response. By contrast, setting stable=true forces the database to use just one replica of the index.\n\nUsing stable=true can cause high latency as it consults only one of the copies of the index, even if the other copies would respond faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n Combining parameters \n\nIf you specify stable=false and update=false, you see greater inconsistency between results, even for the same query and without making database changes.

Each element within the array is sorted by using standard [UTF-8](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/UTF-8) sorting.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Indexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Indexing video \n\nLearn how indexing can speed up your query process.\n\n\n\n* Indexing video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 11 - Indexing.\n\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-41116-43256","score":14.494797,"text":"\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list. It contains data that is sorted by the fields you specify, for example, books that are sorted by date and title. If you perform a query that asks for data that matches a document's date and title, the indexed data structure can be used to speed up the query process. Instead of scanning through every document in turn, IBM Cloudant can jump to the relevant part of the index (say, the section on 20th century books) and retrieve the data much more quickly.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query indexes include two types of indexes: type=json and type=text. These indexes are backed by two underlying indexing technologies that we meet in subsequent parts of this course.\n\nAn index is defined when you POST some JSON to a database's _index endpoint.\n\nThe index object contains a fields array, which specifies which document attributes to index. Usually, the fields that need indexing are equivalent to the attributes used in the selector of a query you're going to use to retrieve the data. That is, if you need to query by the date field, we need to index the date field.\n\nAlthough the name of an index is optional, it's good practice and we follow this convention. It's good to ask IBM Cloudant a question and specify the name of the index you intend it to use. This practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard. Select the database, then choose the Design Documents tab and Query Indexes from the menu.\n\nAny existing indexes are listed on the side: A special index must exist that represents the primary index, based on the document's _id.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07086-7-2167","score":14.293998,"text":"\nQuery overview \n\nIBM Watson\u00ae Discovery offers powerful content search capabilities through search queries.\n\nTo retrieve data from Discovery after it is ingested, indexed, and enriched, submit a query.\n\nAs data is added to Discovery, a representation of each file is stored in the index as a JSON-formatted document.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":1.0,"ndcg_cut_5":1.0,"ndcg_cut_10":1.0}}

When you create your cluster, worker nodes are automatically provisioned as [Virtual Servers for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-about-advanced-virtual-servers) instances and you can view and manage these instances in Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud only.\n\nTo add persistent storage to your VPC cluster, you can use the [Block Storage for VPC add-on](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-block). The add-on sets up pre-defined Kubernetes storage classes, the storage provider, and the storage driver in your cluster so that you can provision Block Storage for VPC by using Kubernetes persistent volume claims (PVCs).\n\nTo secure your cluster network traffic, you can modify the default security group for your worker nodes. For more information, see [Security in your IBM Cloud VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-security-in-your-vpc).\n\nTo connect to a different VPC or to an on-prem data center, use the [VPN for VPC](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-onprem-example) service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kubernetes community and open source integrations \n\nBecause you own the standard clusters that you create in Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, you can choose to install third-party solutions to add extra capabilities to your cluster.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openshift?topic=openshift-ibm-3rd-party-integrations"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_06294-3784-5599","score":23.900438,"text":"\nCreate a VPC called myvpc and note the ID in the output.

NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations.

This feature allows for flexibility and speed of deployment while still providing all the characteristics of a physical network's broadcast domains (VLANs) without physical Layer 2 sprawl. Logical switches allow for thousands of tenant networks to be provisioned onto a single IBM Cloud private network (VLAN).

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located.

Cloud Functions applications use compute capacity and billed only when they are serving user requests. Idle standby or waiting mode is nonexistent.

So the ability to handle many simultaneous events with no prior warning to the system is desirable. It is difficult to build a system to meet these requirements that use traditional server architectures. As they tend to either be underpowered, and unable to handle peak load in traffic, or be over-provisioned and highly expensive.\n\nIt is possible to implement IoT applications that use traditional server architectures.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_14264-0-1759","score":16.74947,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  About VMware and IBM Cloud \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae provides the unique capability for you to provision dedicated Bare Metal Servers upon which you can deploy your own VMware based private cloud.

You can purchase and manage bandwidth metering for classic in two ways, through metering on individual devices, or through collective-metering when you add a device to a bandwidth pool.\n\nAll inbound and outbound bandwidth inside the IBM Cloud Classic infrastructure is unlimited and cost-free for your servers' use. Public egress bandwidth is charged on a tiered basis, with a set allocation for each month of your servers' use.\n\nBandwidth usage is measured as egress traffic on a device's public interfaces.\n\nBandwidth allocations are reserved for all public egress network usage. Devices with individual bandwidth metering and pool-based metering are all measured unless the device is ordered on the private network only.\n\nBandwidth allocation is a threshold where usage below the threshold is free or included, while usage in excess of the threshold is billed as a bandwidth overage. Bandwidth overages are billed individually per server or device, unless they participate in a bandwidth pool.\n\nDevices added to a bandwidth pool contribute both their bandwidth allocation and bandwidth usage to form aggregated totals for the pool. If the pool usage exceeds the total pool allocation, the account owner is billed a consolidated pool overage fee.\n\n\n\n About device bandwidth \n\nYou can manage each device's bandwidth allocation. When you provision certain devices, you can select the amount of bandwidth that you want to allocate to that device. For each device, you pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth allocation during a billing cycle, and receive a notification when the device is at risk of overage for the billing cycle.

Infrastructure services can transfer data between one another across the private network at no cost. Infrastructure offerings (such as bare metal servers, virtual servers, and cloud storage) connect to other applications and services in the IBM Cloud Platform catalog (such as Watson services and Cloud Foundry runtimes) across the public network, so data transfer between those two types of offerings is metered and charged at standard public network bandwidth rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Request classes \n\n'Class A' requests involve modification or listing.

An intent is the purpose or goal expressed in user input.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00485-1687-3253","score":24.196218,"text":"\nFull-text search No No Yes, requires separate installer or container.

Since then, users have been creating and updating skills to meet their virtual assistant needs. Behind the scenes, Watson Assistant creates machine learning (ML) models to perform a variety of tasks on the user's behalf.\n\nThe primary ML models deal with action recognition, intent classification, and entity detection. For example, the model might detect what a user intends when saying I want to open a checking account, and what type of account the user is talking about.\n\nThese ML models rely on a sophisticated infrastructure. There are many intricate components that are responsible for analyzing what the user has said, breaking down the user's input, and processing it so the ML model can more easily predict what the user is asking.\n\nSince Watson Assistant was first released, the product team has been making continuous updates to the algorithms that generate these sophisticated ML models. Older models have continued to function while running in the context of newer algorithms. Historically, the behavior of these existing ML model did not change unless the skill was updated, at which point the skill was retrained and a new model generated to replace the older one. This meant that many older models never benefited from improvements in our ML algorithms.\n\nWatson Assistant uses continuous retraining. The Watson Assistant service continually monitors all ML models, and automatically retrains those models that have not been retrained in the previous 6 months. Watson Assistant retrains using the selected algorithm version. If the version you had selected is no longer supported, Watson Assistant retrains using the version labeled as Previous. This means that your assistant will automatically have the supported technologies applied. Assistants that have been modified during the previous 6 months will not be affected. For more information, see [Algorithm version](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-algorithm-version).\n\nIn most cases, this retraining will be seamless from an end-user point of view. The same inputs will result in the same actions, intents, and entities being detected. In some cases, the retraining might cause changes in accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-auto-retrain"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16233-7-2298","score":18.462791,"text":"\nAbout Watson Assistant \n\nUse IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant to build your own branded live chatbot into any device, application, or channel. Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant uses industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom-built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search integration with IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\nZoom\n\n![Flow diagram of the service](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718\/watson-assistant\/images\/arch-detail.png)\n\nHow it works\n\nCustomers interact with the assistant through one or more of these channels:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-about"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03373-4-1923","score":18.39589,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

You provide information about the subjects or tasks that your users need help with, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n* Actions skill : Offers a simple interface where anyone can build a conversational flow for your assistant to follow. The complex process of training data creation occurs behind the scenes automatically. [Learn more](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-addskill-add-actions-skill)\n* Dialog skill: Offers a set of editors that you use to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree. You use the graphical dialog editor to create a script of sorts for your assistant to read from when it interacts with your customers. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses.

For example, for a time value, 2:15 PM and a quarter past two in the afternoon are both acceptable. But if the user provides a value that the assistant cannot interpret as matching the expected response type (for example, a response of purple when asked for a number), a validation error results.\n\nWhen there is a validation error, the assistant asks the customer to try again. By default, the assistant allows three attempts to provide a valid response. After the third attempt, another invalid attempt triggers the Fallback action, which offers other options like connecting to a live agent. For more information about the Fallback action, see [Editing the fallback action](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-handle-errorsfallback-action).\n\n\n\n Customizing validation for a response \n\nWhen you edit a step that expects a customer response, you can customize how validation errors are handled.\n\n\n\n1. Click Edit validation to see the validation options.\n2. For all customer responses except free text, you can customize the following options:\n\n\n\n* In the Response 1 field, specify the text of the message the assistant sends when the customer's response doesn't match the expected response type. For example, the default validation error message for a numeric value is I didn't catch that. Enter a number. You might want to customize this message to be more specific, such as Enter the number of people in your group.\n* If you want to use several validation responses, click Add Response to add more validation messages. The number of validation responses you can enter depends upon the value in the If attempts exceed field.\n* In the If attempts exceed field, click + or -, or directly edit the number, to change how many consecutive attempts the customer can make before the Fallback action is triggered.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub45581\/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12467-1716-3849","score":22.626272,"text":"\n* When you try to modify or delete a secret while it is locked, Secrets Manager denies the request with an HTTP 412 Precondition Failed response. You see an error message similar to the following example:\n\nThe requested action can't be completed because the secret version is locked.\n\nIf you're working with\n\ndynamic secrets, such as IAM credentials, locking your secrets also means that by default, those secrets can't be read or accessed. For more information, see [Why can't I read a locked IAM credentials secret?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-locked-iam-credentials)\n* If a locked secret reaches its expiration date, it stays in the Active state and its data remains accessible to your applications. Secrets Manager moves the secret to the Destroyed state and permanently deletes the expired secret data only after all locks on the secret are removed.\n\nSSL\/TLS certificates still reach their defined expiration dates and move into a Destroyed state even if they are locked. For more information, see [Why did my locked certificate move to the Destroyed state?](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-locked-certificates)\n* If you try to rotate a secret while its current version is locked and the previous version is unlocked (or if an automatic rotation is scheduled), the request to rotate the secret is allowed. The current secret version becomes the new previous version, retaining its existing locks. A new current version is created without any locks.\n* If you try to rotate a secret while its previous version is locked (or if an automatic rotation is scheduled), your request to rotate the secret is denied. Rotation is allowed only after all locks on the previous secret version are removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating locks in the UI \n\nYou can create up to 1000 locks on a secret by using the Secrets Manager UI. Each lock can be used to represent a single application or service that uses your secret.\n\nA secret is considered locked after you attach one or more locks to it. A lock can be applied only on a secret version that contains active payload, or secret data.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secret-locks"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12467-4-2156","score":22.623228,"text":"\n* UI\n* CLI\n* API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Locking secrets \n\nWhen you work with IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager, you can create locks on your secrets to prevent them from being deleted or modified while they're in use by your applications.\n\nBy default, an authorized user or application can modify the secrets that you manage in Secrets Manager at any time. Sometimes, for example during a security audit, you might want to prevent someone on your team from accidentally deleting a secret. Or, if you plan to rotate your secrets regularly, you might be looking for a way to safely deploy the newest version of a secret after a rotation takes place. With locks, you can build automated workflows that help you to:\n\n\n\n* Indicate that a secret is in use by one or more applications or services.\n* Prevent secret data from being deleted even after a secret expires.\n* Safely delete older versions of secrets after the newest version is fully deployed to your applications.\n* Avoid inadvertent downtime in your applications.\n\n\n\nTo learn about the suggested guidelines for using locks to avoid application downtime, check out [Best practices for rotating and locking secrets](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-rotate-secretsbest-practices-lock-secrets).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you begin, be sure that you have the required level of access.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API. For more information about the phrase operator of the query API, see [Query operators](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-operatorsphrase).\n\n\n\n\n\n A short query returns irrelevant results \n\nIt might be that your query contains too many stop words and not enough distinct terms to trigger a meaningful search. When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time. They do not affect the stop word list that is used by Discovery when data is added to a collection and the index is created.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-improvements"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07242-2547-4328","score":22.027767,"text":"\n\"document_id\": \"bdcd6a9cc1438a3faa8c925f6a8d9429\"\n}\n]\n},\n\"event_type\": \"query\",\n\"session_token\": \"1_LKczxWGEWx5TJAi1_Qs35yOoa7\",\n\"created_timestamp\": \"2018-09-12T05:20:07.469Z\"\n}\nShow more\n\nWith query logs you can investigate the type of results returned to your end users and investigate ways to improve result quality using the approaches available in Discovery.

This can help you understand how well your application is performing, as well as identify areas that you might need to focus on to improve results. Discovery provides an API that can be embedded in your application to track events. Calling this API with the appropriate information when a user performs an action sends a signal back to Discovery, which can then be viewed in the logs.\n\nEvents can help gather information on computing metrics (like clickthrough rate) to measure how effective the application is at helping end users find relevant information, or can be used to help seed training by reviewing the queries and clicks to start to build ground truth.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-usage"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07178-1595-3651","score":21.86948,"text":"\nFor more information, see [Confidence scores](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-toolingconfidence).\n* Discovery returns query results that include special characters for the following languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, and Portuguese.

For information about use cases for relevancy training, see [Improve your natural language query results from Watson Discovery](https:\/\/developer.ibm.com\/blogs\/improving-your-natural-language-query-results-from-watson-discovery\/).\n\nTo train Watson, you must provide the following:\n\n\n\n* Example queries that are representative of the queries your users enter\n* Ratings that indicate which results for each query are relevant and not relevant\n\n\n\nAfter Watson has enough training input, the information that you provide about which results are good and bad for each query is used to learn about your collection. Watson does not just memorize, but it also learns from the specific information about individual queries and applies the patterns it detects to all new queries. It does so, using machine-learning Watson techniques that find signals in your content and questions. After training, Discovery then reorders the query results to display the most relevant results at the top. As you add more and more training data, Discovery becomes more accurate in the ordering of query results.\n\nRelevance training currently applies only to natural language queries in private collections. It is not intended for use with structured Discovery Query Language queries.

You are prompted to choose a collection to train.\n\n\n\n2. On the Train Watson screen, click Add a natural language query, for example: \"IBM Watson in healthcare\", and add it. Make sure your queries are written the way your users would ask them. Also, it is recommended that training queries be written with some term overlap between the query and the desired answer. This overlap improves initial results, when the natural language query is run.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/services\/discovery?topic=discovery-improving-result-relevance-with-the-tooling"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_07178-7-2162","score":20.981749,"text":"\nQuery concepts \n\nIBM Watson\u2122 Discovery offers powerful content search capabilities. Once your content is uploaded and enriched by Discovery, you can build queries, then integrate Discovery into your own projects, or create a custom application by using the Watson Explorer Application Builder.\n\nThe queries you write vary by collection because all collections contain unique content.\n\nWhen you create a query or filter, Discovery looks at each result and tries to match the paths you define. When matches occur, they are added to the results set. When creating a query, you can be as vague or as specific as you want. The more specific the query, the more targeted the results.\n\nYou can write natural language queries (such as \"IBM Watson partnerships\") using the Discovery tooling or the API.\n\n\n\n Default query behavior \n\n\n\n* Stemming is applied to queries by default, which means that results match the root form of words. In contrast, stemming does not allow for matching on any arbitrary substring of a term. For example, words such as \"connections,\" \"connective,\" and \"connected\" are reduced to \"connect.\" But words such as \"boatbuilding,\" \"boathouse,\" and \"boatload,\" are not reduced to \"boat.\"\n* Tokenization occurs using a set of standard separators per language including whitespace, hyphen, underscore, and punctuation marks for English.

Document sentiment evaluates the overall sentiment that is expressed in a document to determine whether it is positive, neutral, or negative. Phrase sentiment does the same. However, phrase sentiment can detect and assess multiple opinions in a single document and, in English and Japanese documents, can find specific phrases.

To complete the deletion, another user with a Manager role can use the Key Protect GUI or API to delete the key at any point during those seven days, at which time the key will be moved to the Destroyed state.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel). When the traffic is split between the VPN interface and other interfaces, split tunneling is said to be in use.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-vpn-planning"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_04122-7-1660","score":11.967114,"text":"\nSetting Transport Layer Security (TLS) options \n\nThe Transport Layer Security (TLS) options let you control whether visitors can browse your website over a secure connection, and when they do, how IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services connects to your origin server.\n\nUse the latest version of the TLS protocol (TLS 1.3) for improved security and performance by switching from Off to On.\n\n\n\n TLS encryption modes \n\nSet the TLS mode by selecting one of the following options from the Mode list.\n\nThese options are listed in the order from the least secure (Off) to the most secure (End-to-End CA signed).\n\n\n\n* [Off](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-off) (not recommended)\n* [Client-to-Edge](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-client-to-edge) (edge to origin not encrypted, self-signed certificates are not supported)\n* [End-to-End flexible](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-end-to-end-flexible) (edge to origin certificates can be self-signed)\n* [End-to-End CA signed](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-end-to-end-ca-signed) (default and recommended)\n* [HTTPS only origin pull](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/cis?topic=cis-cis-tls-optionstls-encryption-modes-origin-only-pull) (Enterprise only)\n\n\n\n\n\n Off \n\nNo secure connection between your visitor and CIS, and no secure connection between CIS and your web server.

This index allows documents to be retrieved by _id (GET \/db\/id) or a range of _ids (GET \/db\/_all_docs?startkey=\"a\"&endkey=\"z\"). By storing data in the primary key and ensuring that each _id is unique, the primary index can be used to fetch documents and ranges of documents without secondary indexing. See the following list of ideas:\n\n\n\n* If you have something unique in your object that would be useful to query against, use it as your _id field, for example, bob.smith@gmail.com, isbn9780241265543, or oakland,ca.\n* If your objects contain a hierarchy, model that in your _id: usa:ca:oakland or books:fiction:9780241265543. The hierarchy goes from largest to smallest, so you can use the primary index to find all the cities in usa or all the cities in usa:ca, without secondary indexing.\n* If you're storing time-series data, encoding time at the start of your _id sorts the primary index by time, for example, 001j40Ox1b2c1B2ubbtm4CsuLB4L35wQ.\n* Partitioned databases group documents that share a partition key together. A partition key must have many values and must not include hot spots to avoid directing a large proportion of your application's traffic to a few partitions.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00500-14708-16372","score":18.734547,"text":"\nWe limit documents to a maximum size of 64 MB.\n\n\n\n\n\n No JavaScript reducers when options.partitioned is true \n\nDesign documents with options.partitioned set to true can't contain JavaScript reduce functions, only built-ins Erlang reducers such as _stats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Storing the view definition \n\nEach view is a JavaScript function.

Data encryption by using customer-managed keys is supported by integrations with Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Services.\n\n\n\n How your data is stored and encrypted in Secrets Manager \n\nWhen you work with Secrets Manager, the service communicates with HashiCorp Vault to process operations on secrets of different types. By design, [Vault uses a security barrier](https:\/\/developer.hashicorp.com\/vault\/docs\/internals\/securityexternal-threat-overview) for all requests that are made to its back end. Data that leaves Vault is automatically encrypted by using a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher in the Galois Counter Mode (GCM) with 96-bit nonces.\n\nSecrets Manager encrypts all secrets at rest with\n\nenvelope encryption. Your encrypted secrets are stored in a dedicated Cloud Object Storage bucket that is unique to your instance. To protect secrets at rest, Secrets Manager integrates with a key management service, such as Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services. Each version of every secret is encrypted by a data encryption key (DEK) that is protected by aroot key, which is used by Secrets Manager to [seal and unseal access to Vault](https:\/\/developer.hashicorp.com\/vault\/docs\/concepts\/seal). This integration protects your secrets by using encryption keys that are rooted in FIPS-validatedhardware security modules. At no time are your credentials available in clear text while they are stored by the service.\n\nSecrets Manager also uses the following security mechanisms to protect your data in transit.\n\n\n\n* TLS 1.2+ for end to end communications\n* mTLS for internal communications\n* Web App Firewall and DDoS protection\n* Ingress and Egress network rules to isolate your dedicated instance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Protecting your sensitive data in Secrets Manager \n\nYou can add a higher level of encryption control to your data at rest (when it is stored) by enabling integration with a key management service.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-mng-data"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12418-1612-3668","score":21.12108,"text":"\nIf you have existing configurations on secrets engines in your instance, you can also retrieve the information programmatically so that it can be re-created in a new instance.

For more information, see [Adding skills to your assistant](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add).\n\n\n\n* Assistants: You can now publish your skill in just two steps. Add your skill to an assistant, and then set up one or more integrations with which to deploy your skill. The assistant adds a layer of function to your skill that enables Watson Assistant to orchestrate and manage the flow of information for you. See [Assistants](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants).\n* Built-in integrations: Instead of going to the Deploy tab to deploy your workspace, you add your dialog skill to an assistant, and add integrations to the assistant through which the skill is made available to your users. You do not need to build a custom front-end application and manage the conversation state from one call to the next. However, you can still do so if you want to. See [Adding integrations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add) for more information.\n* New major API version: A V2 version of the API is available. This version provides access to methods you can use to interact with an assistant at run time. No more passing context with each API call; the session state is managed for you as part of the assistant layer.\n\n\n\nWhat is presented in the tooling as a dialog skill is effectively a wrapper for a V1 workspace. There are currently no API methods for authoring skills and assistants with the V2 API. However, you can continue to use the V1 API for authoring workspaces.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03329-4-1522","score":23.778349,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03797-4528-6268","score":23.255484,"text":"\n[A view of the invoices page in the IBM Cloud console.

Send a GET request to retrieve a document.\n2. Run the following command: https:\/\/$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com\/$DATABASE\/$DOCUMENT_ID.\n\n\n\nRecall that for a partitioned database the $DOCUMENT_ID is formed of a partition key part and a document key part.\n\nIf you don't know the _id for a particular document, you can [query the database](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantpostalldocsqueries) for all documents.\n\nDue to the distributed, eventually consistent nature of IBM Cloudant, reads might return stale data. In particular, data written recently, even by the same client, might not be returned from a read request immediately following the write request. To work around this behavior, a client can cache the state of data locally. Caching also helps to keep request counts down, increase application performance, and decrease load on the database cluster. This behavior also applies to other read requests such as to MapReduce and search indexes.\n\nSee an example of retrieving a document by using HTTP:\n\nGET \/$DATABASE\/$DOCUMENT_ID HTTP\/1.1\n\nYou can customize this section for the programming language that you want to use by selecting the language in the code examples.\n\nSee an example of retrieving a document:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Python\n* Go\n* Node\n\n\n\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $API_BEARER_TOKEN\" -X GET \"$SERVICE_URL\/products\/small-appliances:1000042\"\n\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.Cloudant;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.Document;\nimport com.ibm.cloud.cloudant.v1.model.GetDocumentOptions;\n\nCloudant service = Cloudant.newInstance();\n\nGetDocumentOptions documentOptions =\nnew GetDocumentOptions.Builder()\n.db(\"products\")\n.docId(\"small-appliances:1000042\")","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-read-a-document"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00644-29795-31578","score":24.982279,"text":"\nMulti-document fetching \n\nThe following section covers a POST request to many documents from a database.\n\nFor a client application, this technique is more efficient than using multiple [GET](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-viewsquerying-a-view) API requests.\n\nHowever, include_docs=true might require extra processing time when compared to accessing the view on its own.\n\nThe reason is that by using include_docs=true in a view query, all of the result documents must be retrieved to construct the response for the client application. In effect, a whole series of document GET requests are run, each of which competes for resources with other application requests.\n\nOne way to mitigate this effect is by retrieving results directly from the view index file. Omit include_docs=true to retrieve results directly from the view index file. Instead, in the map function in a design document, emit the fields that are required as the value for the view index.\n\nFor example, in your map function, you might use the following design specification:\n\nfunction(user) {\nif(user.email_verified === true) {\nemit(user.email, {name: user.name, email_verified: user.email_verified, joined: user.joined});\n}\n}\n\nSee the example request that uses HTTP to obtain the full content of documents that match the listed keys within a partition:\n\nPOST $SERVICE_URL\/$DATABASE\/_partition\/$PARTITION_KEY\/_design\/$DDOC\/_view\/$VIEW_NAME HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Type: application\/json\n\n{\n\"include_docs\": true,\n\"keys\" : [\n\"1000043\",\n\"1000044\"\n]\n}\n\nSee the example request to obtain the full content of documents that match the listed keys within the products partition:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Node\n* Python\n* Go\n\n\n\ncurl -X POST \"$SERVICE_URL\/products\/_partition\/small-appliances\/_design\/appliances\/_view","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-views"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-41116-43256","score":24.573904,"text":"\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list. It contains data that is sorted by the fields you specify, for example, books that are sorted by date and title. If you perform a query that asks for data that matches a document's date and title, the indexed data structure can be used to speed up the query process. Instead of scanning through every document in turn, IBM Cloudant can jump to the relevant part of the index (say, the section on 20th century books) and retrieve the data much more quickly.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query indexes include two types of indexes: type=json and type=text. These indexes are backed by two underlying indexing technologies that we meet in subsequent parts of this course.\n\nAn index is defined when you POST some JSON to a database's _index endpoint.\n\nThe index object contains a fields array, which specifies which document attributes to index. Usually, the fields that need indexing are equivalent to the attributes used in the selector of a query you're going to use to retrieve the data. That is, if you need to query by the date field, we need to index the date field.\n\nAlthough the name of an index is optional, it's good practice and we follow this convention. It's good to ask IBM Cloudant a question and specify the name of the index you intend it to use. This practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard. Select the database, then choose the Design Documents tab and Query Indexes from the menu.\n\nAny existing indexes are listed on the side: A special index must exist that represents the primary index, based on the document's _id.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00474-6472-8322","score":24.368528,"text":"\nWhen the front end submits a team selection to the team route (see [index.html](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-combine-ibm-servicesindex-html-redis)), the app.route function first checks the cache to see whether it has the data already. If it does, then it returns that. Otherwise, it makes a query to IBM Cloudant to retrieve team data, store it in the cache, and return it to the front end.\n\nThe read operation uses an IBM Cloudant design document and a MapReduce view to select documents.

If you delete an App Configuration instance mid-month, the monthly Application Instance charge is pro-rated. To predict month instance cost, you must be aware of the number of App Configuration instances you have and what pricing plan is assigned to each.\n\nSee all your existing instances in the IBM Cloud Console Resource List in the Services Section. Determine your plan either by clicking the Resource List row that contains your App Configuration instance to reveal an information slide-out, or go to the instance dashboard and look in the Plan section.\n\nSome App Configuration pricing plans have a monthly Application Instance price and others do not.

Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https:\/\/web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com\/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region. When the failover needs to be manually triggered, make the following changes:","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-failover"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03312-5487-7760","score":17.921553,"text":"\nIf a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region. This is much harder to detect and manage because of the large number of variations in service failures that can occur within a region. In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call. The first is to accept the call and then transfer it to a configured default SIP URI. This can be configured in the Watson Assistant phone integration settings and is also used if there is a mid-call failure. The default transfer target SIP URI is defined in the SIP target when a call fails field located on the Advanced tab of the phone integration configuration panel.\n\nThe phone integration can also be configured to respond to a SIP INVITE with a SIP 500 (service unavailable) message if an outage is detected during call setup instead of transferring a call to a live agent.

In a flash, their hardware headaches went away. They were able to easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their high-performance CPU, RAM, storage, and security needs. And when their analysis apps change, they can add or shrink compute without huge hardware investments. With the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance. Their predictive and risk analytics functions, such as Monte Carlo calculations, are now constantly updated through iterative agile deployments. Container orchestration is handled by a managed Kubernetes so that operations costs are reduced too.

Register an account with the IBM Cloud, if you don't have one already.\n\nOnce registered, you can click services, search for the Cloudant database, and provision a new service.\n\nThe IBM Cloudant Lite service provides a free plan to allow users to try IBM Cloudant in a limited capacity while in development. Its bigger brother, the Standard Plan, is a paid-for service where you specify the number of reads, writes, and queries per second for your application and that capacity is reserved for you. You pay for the capacity you provision and your data storage usage.\n\nThe Lite plan operates in a similar way. It has only a small provisioned capacity and a fixed storage size, but it's fine for testing the IBM Cloudant service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is often referred to as a \"schemaless\" database - but we have to be careful how we define that term.\n\nIt's true to say that you don't need to define your schema (field names, types, constraints, and relationships) ahead of time in an IBM Cloudant database.

You can simply write a JSON document of your own design to a database.\n\nDevelopers like this flexibility because they can design their data in their code, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database.\n\nIt's still important to think about the shape of your data, especially in terms of how you are going to query and index it, as we see later.\n\nData design is still required, but strictly speaking that database doesn't need to know about your schema.\n\nLet's say we want to create a database of US presidents. We can simply devise our \"model\" of the data in our app, turn it into JSON, and write it to the database. In this case, we are using a common CouchDB convention: the \"type\" field indicates the data type of the document.\n\nIf at a future date we decide we want to add more data to our \"schema\", we can simply write a new object to the database with no complaints from IBM Cloudant. We could decide to add the \"address\" object only to the following documents:\n\n\n\n* Documents that are created from now on.\n* Only documents that we have addresses for.\n\n\n\nIn other words, documents of the same type can have fields present or missing.\n\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00580-37889-39953","score":20.782654,"text":"\nIf you need to access objects within documents, you can use standard dot notation for example, address.zipcode to access a postal code string inside an address object.\n\nWe can also add the following parameters:\n\nFields\n: Specifies the document attributes that we want returned (the default is the entire document).\n\nSort\n: Defines how the data is to be sorted. Sort is an array, allowing the sort to be calculated on multiple attributes.\n\nLimit\n: The number of documents to return.\n\nIf you are from a relational database background, this query is the equivalent SQL query to that last IBM Cloudant query example.\n\nThe WHERE clause is the equivalent of SELECTOR in IBM Cloudant Query. ORDER and LIMIT are exactly equivalent, and the IBM Cloudant Query FIELDS list is equivalent to the comma-separated list of attributes after the SELECT keyword.\n\nThe JSON syntax might take a bit of getting used to, but MongoDB users might find it familiar.\n\nIBM Cloudant queries can be executed in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. Select the database that you are working with, for example, books then choose the Query tab.\n\nEnter your IBM Cloudant Query JSON in the box that is provided, and click Run Query when you're ready. The result set appears on the page.\n\nThe Explain button is used to provide an explanation on how the database interprets the supplied query. This explanation becomes more important when we get to Indexing in the next part.\n\nQueries can be triggered from curl too. The Query JSON, in this case, is stored in a file and we POST to the _find endpoint by using the -d@ command-line syntax.\n\nThe Node.js code is similar. The Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-skill-add"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03369-66296-68553","score":20.984247,"text":"\nVisit the learning center!\n: Click the Learning center link that is displayed in the header of the skill pages to find helpful product tours.

We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-release-notes"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03120-1659-3917","score":20.957722,"text":"\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

If a transaction is tampered with on its way to the recipient, the signature verification fails.\n* Channels: While Fabric channels are a powerful mechanism for partitioning and isolating data, they also provide the primary foundation for data privacy.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.

When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_16365-8408-10508","score":18.697681,"text":"\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/new-in-21\/) standard.

To view the steps, see [Reviewing or defining cost by using the console](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-onboard-custom&interface=uicustom-cost-ui).\n\n\n\n\n\n Reviewing or defining cost by using the console \n\nYou can review the estimated starting cost of your product. If you included the resource metadata in your source repository, the information is parsed during validation and pulled into a starting cost per hour (USD) summary table. The table is displayed in the catalog for customers to compare across variations of a deployable architecture or to get a general idea of what a base configuration of your deployable architecture might cost.\n\nThe summary table lists the resources that your product uses and their estimated costs. Starting cost is an estimate based on available data.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-onboard-custom"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_12104-9776-11234","score":18.430944,"text":"\nSoftware deployments with Schematics\n\n\n\n1. Choose a template: The [IBM software solutions catalog](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/catalogsoftware) offers a wide variety of infrastructure and software templates that you can choose from.
