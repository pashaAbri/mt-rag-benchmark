Basic filtering allows clients to specify one or more filters where each supported field is required to match a specific value. The query parameter names for a basic filter must match the name of a primitive field on a resource in the collection exactly or a nested primitive field where the . character is the hierarchical separator. The resulting collection must satisfy all filters. For example, a filter could be implemented to return only users whose first name is \"John\" and last name is \"Smith\".",

This is particularly useful for organizations in industries like finance and healthcare, or those dealing with financial records management, as it ensures data integrity and prevents privileged modification or deletion of objects or documents.\n\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages. Immutable Object Storage is not currently supported in Object Storage for Satellite and requires a Standard pricing plan. It's also only available in certain regions and cannot be used with Aspera high-speed transfer. Once a retention policy is defined, it cannot be altered until the retention period expires, which may limit flexibility.

Additionally, you can leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect malicious attacks and suspicious usage patterns.\n\nFor access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies that you assign users vary depending on what you want your users to be able to do. You can find more information about what roles authorize which types of actions on the User access reference page or in the following table's links.\n\nFor minimum required permissions, an Administrator platform access role for the cluster in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is required.
