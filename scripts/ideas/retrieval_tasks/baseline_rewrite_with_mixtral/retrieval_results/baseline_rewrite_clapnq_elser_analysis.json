It is the most popular spectator sport in the United States, with the National Football League (NFL) having the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world.\n\nIn summary, soccer emphasizes kicking and minimal physical contact, while American football features a variety of ways to advance the ball and has more extensive rulebooks and equipment.

East German authorities no longer permitted apartments near the Wall to be occupied, and any building near the Wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up (Passage 3).\n\nSubsequently, people resorted to more intricate escape methods, such as digging long tunnels under the Wall (Passage 1), waiting for favorable winds and taking a hot air balloon (Passage 1), sliding along aerial wires, flying ultralights (Passage 1), and driving sports cars at full speed through the initial fortifications (Passage 1). Some even managed to escape through the sewers with assistance from the Unternehmen Reisebüro (Passage 1).

His efforts towards rapprochement with East Germany and other Eastern Bloc countries significantly improved relations and paved the way for the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over East-Central Europe.\n\nBrandt's accomplishments were recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.

International organizations, such as the United Nations, have recognized the importance of sustainable urban drainage systems to mitigate the environmental impact of stormwater runoff. Some practices include using permeable paving materials, directing runoff to unlined ditches, and infiltrating rooftop runoff into adjacent soil. These practices can help reduce the amount of stormwater entering the storm sewer system and promote water conservation.",

In early Scotland, people of Mainland Orkney like Gurness and the Brough of Birsay also had elements of stormwater drain systems. Ancient Egyptian civilization, which was based on agricultural wealth from the Nile's predictable flooding, had an independent writing system and a bureaucracy to organize collective construction and agricultural projects, ensuring the cooperation and unity of the people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.",

The U.S. embargo, which cut off Japan's access to 80% of its oil, created a crisis for Japan's war effort against China. This economic and military pressure led Japan to seek an alternative source of petroleum in Southeast Asia, a region rich in natural resources. The threat of retaliation from Japan due to the embargo was known to the American government, and the loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China on a long-term basis. This chain of events set the stage for Japan's military attacks against the Allies, including the attack on Pearl Harbor, which marked Japan's formal entry into World War II.",

His primary concerns were the war in Europe and the growing strength of the Axis Powers. Despite the U.S. government's official neutrality, he initiated the Lend-Lease program to supply military equipment to Britain, China, and later the Soviet Union. \n\nRegarding Japan, Roosevelt was concerned about its foreign policy challenges and the deteriorating relations since the 1931 invasion of Manchuria. After Japan occupied French Indochina, Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil, depriving Japan of more than 95% of its oil supply, which significantly impacted Japan's ability to continue its war effort against China. \n\nAdditionally, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt led the U.S. into World War II, working closely with Allied leaders to defeat the Axis Powers. He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe-first strategy.\n\nIn summary, President Franklin D. Roosevelt played a crucial role in shaping the United States' interactions with Japan during World War II, from imposing economic sanctions to leading the country in declaring war and working with Allied forces to achieve victory.",

Its development began in the late 1970s, and since then, it has evolved with procedures similar to egg donation. In egg donation, the donor's eggs are harvested, fertilized in the lab, and transferred into the intended mother or a gestational surrogate. This combination has enabled gay men, like Elton John, to have biological children. IVF and related techniques now account for approximately 18% of in vitro fertilization recorded births in the US.\n\nIn some cases, superfecundation can occur, where multiple sperms fertilize eggs from the same cycle, resulting in multiple offspring with different fathers. This rare phenomenon has been reported in IVF cases, such as the Stuart boys and quintuplets born in 2001. In 2016, an IVF-implanted surrogate mother gave birth to two children: one genetically unrelated and another, her biological child.",

The ideal donor is a close relative, due to the specific HLA typing required. However, finding a suitable donor is difficult, as only 10% of people have one available. Additionally, there's a 7% risk of death from the procedure itself, and graft versus host disease may occur. Gene therapy clinical trials, involving autologous transplants of lentiviral vector-modified bone marrow, are underway to assess safety and efficacy. Umbilical cord blood transplants can also potentially cure the condition, but their use is limited by the availability of a compatible donor.",

His father's death significantly impacted his artistic life, leading him to focus on profound aspects of life in his poetry. His poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\" is an example of this shift. Cummings also incorporated nature and death imagery in his work.

However, the invention allowed for this increased production with fewer workers, as a team of slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in a day, compared to a single slave taking ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from seeds without the gin. As a result, the number of slaves involved in cotton production did rise, but this was due to the expansion of cotton fields and plantations, not an increased need for individual workers to clean the cotton.",

The efficiency of the cotton gin allowed for a significant boost in output, as a team of slaves using the machine could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in a single day, in contrast to the ten hours required for a single slave to separate a single pound of fiber from seeds without the gin.",

Considering the increased efficiency in cotton production leading to the expansion of cotton fields and slavery in the American South, which exacerbated tensions between the Northern and Southern states, could the cotton gin have played a role in the eventual outbreak of the American Civil War?",
      "generated_response": "Yes, the invention of the cotton gin is frequently cited as an indirect cause of the American Civil War. By dramatically increasing the efficiency of cotton production, it led to the expansion of cotton fields and slavery in the American South. This growth in the cotton industry and reliance on slave labor exacerbated tensions between the Northern and Southern states, contributing to the eventual outbreak of the Civil War.",

      "generated_response": "Yes, Britain was heavily dependent on cotton from the Southern United States for its textile mills. However, by 1863, Britain had partially alleviated its cotton shortage through imports from India and Egypt. When the American Civil War began, Britain initially considered intervening due to this dependence, but ultimately refrained from doing so, especially after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, making support of the Confederacy synonymous with support for slavery.",

      "generated_response": "Modern cotton gins, like their historical counterparts, are used to separate cotton fibers from seeds. However, they have evolved significantly in efficiency and automation. Cotton arrives at industrial gins in trailers or modules, which are then sucked in via large pipes. Module feeders break apart the modules and extract foreign material. The increased efficiency of cotton gins, such as Eli Whitney's 1793 invention, made cotton a highly profitable business, leading to the growth of major shipping ports in the Southern United States and the development of textile industries elsewhere. This expansion contributed to tensions between Northern and Southern states, indirectly leading to the American Civil War. Additionally, the demand for cotton and improved machine designs led to the invention of many machine tools in the early 19th century. Britain, heavily dependent on Southern U.S. cotton for its textile mills, sought alternatives during the Civil War, partially alleviating its cotton shortage through imports from India and Egypt.",

      "rewritten_query": "What was the timeline and impact of the abolition of slave labor, particularly in relation to cotton production and global trade?",
      "generated_response": "The timeline of slave labor abolition began with the British Empire in 1834, followed by other regions like Russia, America, and Brazil. In the United States, the slave population grew with the cultivation of cotton, which remained profitable until the 1830s due to agricultural innovations. The abolition of slave labor had significant impacts on cotton production and global trade. With the British Empire's abolition in 1834, for instance, the Empire compensated slave owners, and slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of apprenticeship. This change affected the global cotton supply, as Britain was heavily dependent on cotton from the Southern United States. As a result, Britain sought alternatives during the American Civil War, partially alleviating its cotton shortage through imports from India and Egypt. The abolition of slave labor also led to improved machine designs and the growth of machine tool industries.",
