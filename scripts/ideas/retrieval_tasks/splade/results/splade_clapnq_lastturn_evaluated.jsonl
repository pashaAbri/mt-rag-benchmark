They suggested that Thomas Lovell should undertake the work , which he did , at a cost of \u00a3 12,000 , for which he received 15,000 acres ( 6,100 ha ) of the land which was reclaimed as a result of the work .

The work included making the Welland deeper and wider from Deeping St James to its outfall beyond Spalding , and the construction of side drains . These included a drain running from Pode Hole to below Spalding , which is still known as Vernatt 's Drain , after one of the adventurers called Sir Philibert Vernatti .

Grundy 's shorter channel had been finished by 1810 , improving both drainage and navigation . James Walker reported in 1835 on further improvements , making the recommendation that the river below Spalding should be constrained between high banks , so that the scouring action of the water would dredge its own channel . Rather than excavating , which he estimated would cost \u00a3 70,000 , he suggested using fascines made of thorn branches , around which silt would be deposited . Such a scheme would only cost \u00a3 13,000 , and the work went on for many years . The effects of the embankments had resulted in the bed of the river below Fosdyke being around 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) lower by 1845 . In 1867 , the River Welland Outfall Act enabled the trustees to raise money to repair the walls where the tide had washed away some of the fill behind the fascines .

In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur .

However , private practitioners had to purchase vaccine from commercial producers . Although proper use of glycerine reduced bacterial contamination considerably the crude starting material , scraped from the skin of infected calves , was always heavily contaminated and no vaccine was totally free from bacteria . A survey of vaccines in 1900 found wide variations in bacterial contamination . Vaccine issued by the Government Vaccine Establishment contained 5,000 bacteria per gram , while commercial vaccines contained up to 100,000 per gram . The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1925 set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram , and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections . Unfortunately glycerolated vaccine soon lost its potency at ambient temperatures which restricted its use in tropical climates . However , it remained in use into the 1970s where a satisfactory cold chain was available . Animals continued to be widely used by vaccine producers during the Smallpox Eradication Campaign . A WHO survey of 59 producers , some of whom used more than one source of vaccine , found that 39 used calves , 12 used sheep and 6 used water buffalo , whilst only 3 made vaccine in cell culture and 3 in embryonated hens ' eggs .

During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas , tetanus , septicaemia and tuberculosis . In the case of arm - to - arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis . Although this did occur occasionally , estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations , some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis .

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease .

A method of inducing immunity known as inoculation , insufflation or `` variolation '' was practiced before the development of a modern vaccine and likely occurred in Africa and China well before the practice arrived in Europe . It may also have occurred in India , but this is disputed ; other investigators contend the ancient Sanskrit medical texts of India do not describe these techniques . The first clear reference to smallpox inoculation was made by the Chinese author Wan Quan ( 1499 -- 1582 ) in his Douzhen xinfa ( \u75d8 \u75b9 \u5fc3 \u6cd5 ) published in 1549 . Inoculation for smallpox does not appear to have been widespread in China until the reign era of the Longqing Emperor ( r . 1567 -- 1572 ) during the Ming Dynasty . In China , powdered smallpox scabs were blown up the noses of the healthy . The patients would then develop a mild case of the disease and from then on were immune to it . The technique did have a 0.5 -- 2.0 % mortality rate , but that was considerably less than the 20 -- 30 % mortality rate of the disease itself . Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700 ; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers . According to Voltaire ( 1742 ) , the Turks derived their use of inoculation to neighbouring Circassia . Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from , though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it `` these hundred years '' .","title":"Smallpox vaccine","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.0,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":0.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.5,"ndcg_cut_5":0.5,"ndcg_cut_10":0.5}}

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats .

The game of hockey , though much in vogue on the ice in New England and other parts of the United States , is not much known here , and in consequence the game of last evening was looked forward to with great interest . Hockey is played usually with a ball , but last night , in order that no accident should happen , a flat block of wood was used , so that it should slide along the ice without rising , and thus going among the spectators to their discomfort . The game is like Lacrosse in one sense -- the block having to go through flags placed about 8 feet apart in the same manner as the rubber ball -- but in the main the old country game of shinty gives the best idea of hockey . The players last night were eighteen in number -- nine on each side -- and were as follows : -- Messrs. Torrance ( captain ) , Meagher , Potter , Goff , Barnston , Gardner , Griffin , Jarvis and Whiting . Creighton ( captain ) , Campbell , Campbell , Esdaile , Joseph , Henshaw , Chapman , Powell and Clouston . The match was an interesting and well - contested affair , the efforts of the players exciting much merriment as they wheeled and dodged each other , and notwithstanding the brilliant play of Captain Torrance 's team Captain Creighton 's men carried the day , winning two games to the single of the Torrance nine . The game was concluded about half - past nine , and the spectators then adjourned well satisfied with the evening 's entertainment .","title":"First indoor ice hockey game","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"842006194_20465-20709-0-244","score":11.5409555435,"text":"Pete Maravich\nDespite some setbacks coping with their father 's death and without the benefit that his tutelage might have provided , both sons eventually were inspired to play high school and collegiate basketball -- Josh at his father 's alma mater , LSU .","title":"Pete Maravich","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"845635430_2538-2940-0-402","score":11.4236106873,"text":"First indoor ice hockey game\nIn 1873 , James Creighton , a member of the Victoria Skating Club and a figure skating judge , started organizing sessions of shinny at the rink , played informally between members of the Club and friends .

If one were however to weigh a small wading pool that someone then entered and began floating in , they would find that the full weight of the person was being borne by the pool and , ultimately , the scale underneath the pool .

Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses .

However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_17441-19104-0-1663","score":21.6192016602,"text":"Guinea pig\nA `` wheek '' is a loud noise , the name of which is onomatopoeic , also known as a whistle .

The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic - making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise - shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird .

While Toby is mainly a passive victim to Micheal 's abuse who tries his best to remain calm , Toby himself has shown on a few occasions in the series that he enjoys seeing Michael in misery such as when he injures his foot and collapses and struggles in the restroom ( where Michael is disgusted by the idea of Toby helping him instead of Ryan , and Toby gets to mock Michael 's wimpiness and notes with disdain `` you only grilled your foot '' ) and when Toby viciously beats Michael in a game of poker , in which he says he will chase the feeling of taking Michael 's money . Toby has also laughed at Michael 's misfortune on occasion such as in `` The Deposition '' when Toby learns that Michael thinks Ryan is hot and also in `` Koi Pond '' when he learns Michael has fallen into two fountains . Toby once even instructed Pam on how to hit Michael harder after he gave her the opportunity to do so for dating and dumping her mother , showing that he enjoys seeing Michael suffer to a degree . Toby has on occasion stood up to Michael such as in `` Classy Christmas '' when Michael tries to accuse Toby of destroying Holly 's beloved Woody doll to which Toby immediately responds that the vandalism is something that Michael would do , to which everyone agrees . Toby seems to have a strong ability to absorb Michael 's abuse as seen in `` Goodbye Toby '' where he is given a potential opportunity to complain about Michael 's antics and after Michael threatens to kill him ( though he does so in a situation where Holly and Pam would be able to listen to Toby 's issues if he wanted to present them , as they either do n't know how awful Michael has been to him or , in Pam 's case , know it very well ) , Toby claims that everything in the office is fine , and later shrugs to the camera that he has survived Michael 's abuse long enough and that disclosing it is pointless .","title":"Toby Flenderson","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"822159927_5569-6913-0-1344","score":19.4878482819,"text":"Toby Flenderson\nToby avoids office activities whenever possible and , like most of the staff , only tolerates Michael . He has reached out to Michael several times despite Michael 's continued abuse . However , he gets along with the rest of the staff and even attends Jim 's barbecue party , playing video games while Michael sings karaoke . When Dwight approached Michael about missing a gift bag during `` A Benihana Christmas , '' Michael immediately suggested stealing it from Toby , much to Toby 's later chagrin , as all the office staff had new robes except for him ( Pam later gave her robe to Toby , and this increased Toby 's unrequited crush on her ) . In addition Michael on numerous occasions attempts to blame Toby for problems that are clearly his own fault such as in `` The Merger '' in which he questions Tony Gardner if the reason he is quitting is because of Toby , though Tony says Toby was in fact kind and helpful and it 's Michael 's management that is the reason . This occurs again notably in `` Classy Christmas '' where Michael himself vandalizes Holly 's Woody doll ( A gift from her boyfriend ) and tries to convince her Toby did it , though Toby fights back , denies it and says the vandalism is something Michael would do . This is evidence that Michael uses Toby as an excuse to hide from the consequences of his own actions .","title":"Toby Flenderson","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"}],"retriever_scores":{"recall_1":0.5,"recall_3":1.0,"recall_5":1.0,"recall_10":1.0,"ndcg_cut_1":1.0,"ndcg_cut_3":0.9197207891,"ndcg_cut_5":0.9197207891,"ndcg_cut_10":0.9197207891}}

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV .

In contrast , the Western Empire was more fragmented . Its capital was transferred to Ravenna in 402 largely for defensive reasons , and it had easy access to the imperial fleet of the Eastern Empire but was isolated in other aspects as it was surrounded by swamps and marshes . This isolation was intentional , as Ravenna had been chosen as capital due to being more defensible against the increasing barbarian incursions . The economic power remained focused on Rome and its hyper - rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of Italy and Africa in particular . After Gallienus banned senators from army commands in the mid-3rd century , the senatorial elite lost all experience of -- and interest in -- military life . In the early 5th century the wealthy landowning elite of the Roman Senate largely barred its tenants from military service , but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend the entire Western Empire . The West 's most important military area had been northern Gaul and the Rhine frontier in the 4th century , when Trier frequently served as the capital of the Empire and many leading Western generals were Barbarians . After the civil war in 394 between Theodosius I and the usurper Eugenius , the new Western government installed by Theodosius I increasingly had to divert military resources from Britain and the Rhine to protect Italy .

Christians ' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life , which caused non-Christians -- including government authorities -- to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire . In addition , the peculiar intimacy of Christian society and its secrecy about its religious practices spawned rumors that Christians were guilty of incest and cannibalism ; the resulting persecutions , although usually local and sporadic , were a defining feature of Christian self - understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century . A series of more centrally organized persecutions of Christians emerged in the late 3rd century , when emperors decreed that the Empire 's military , political , and economic crises were caused by angry gods . All residents were ordered to give sacrifices or be punished . Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Jewish Tax . Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000 . Many fled or renounced their beliefs . Disagreements over what role , if any , these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and Novatianist schisms . Relations between the Church and the Empire were not consistent : `` Tiberius wanted to have Christ placed in the Pantheon and refused first of all to persecute the Christians . Later on his attitude changed . ( - ) How are we to explain the fact that men like Trajan and above all Marcus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Christians ? On the other hand Commodus and other villainous emperors rather favoured them . '' In spite of these persecutions , evangelization efforts persisted , leading to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in 313 . By 380 , Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman Empire . Religious philosopher Simone Weil wrote : `` By the time of Constantine , the state of apocalyptic expectation must have worn rather thin . ( The imminent coming of Christ , expectation of the Last Day - constituted ' a very great social danger .

According to the classical economists , lower interest rates would lead to increased investment spending and demand would remain constant . However , Keynes argues that there are good reasons why investment does not necessarily increase in response to a fall in the interest rate . Businesses make investments based on expectations of profit . Therefore , if a fall in consumption appears to be long - term , businesses analyzing trends will lower expectations of future sales . Therefore , the last thing they are interested in doing is investing in increasing future production , even if lower interest rates make capital inexpensive . In that case , the economy can be thrown into a general slump due to a decline in consumption .

Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , expulsion of Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 . The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt extended its control over the Levant in the 13th century until its defeat by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 . During the 19th century , national awakening among Jews led to the establishment of the Zionist movement in the diaspora followed by waves of immigration to Ottoman and later British Palestine .","title":"Israel","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"837288933_19051-19480-0-429","score":22.5472640991,"text":"Israel\nIn 1516 , the region was conquered by the Ottoman Empire ; it remained under Turkish rule until the end of the First World War , when Britain defeated the Ottoman forces and set up a military administration across the former Ottoman Syria .

The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent .

All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues .

Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses . The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak .

This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .","title":"Guinea pig","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850931827_588-1089-0-501","score":21.0703392029,"text":"Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig or domestic guinea pig ( Cavia porcellus ) , also known as cavy or domestic cavy , is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia .

Many other , possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist . For example , sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs , which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat . The French term is cochon d'Inde ( Indian pig ) or cobaye ; the Dutch call it Guinees biggetje ( Guinean piglet ) or cavia ( while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat ) ; and in Portuguese , the guinea pig is variously referred to as cobaia , from the Tupi word via its Latinization , or as porquinho da \u00cdndia ( little Indian pig ) . This is not universal ; for example , the common word in Spanish is conejillo de Indias ( little rabbit of the Indies ) .

The penitent and humbled emperor did not remain in that state . Soon Henry IV took his revenge . He named his own pope Antipope Clement III in the old manner of the Holy Roman Emperors . Pope Urban II , more prudent than Gregory sidestepped the issue using a Crusade to gather Christian Europe together under his authority . A compromise was reached in Worms in 1122 , by which the emperor abandoned investiture `` by ring and staff '' to the pope , and promised to respect the freedom of elections and consecrations , but kept for himself the right to invest bishops with the temporalities of their sees `` by scepter '' . Though the Emperor retained some power over imperial churches , his power was damaged irreparably because he lost the religious authority that previously belonged to the office of the king . In France , England , and the Christian state in Spain , the king could overcome rebellions of his magnates and establish the power of his royal demesne because he could rely on the Church , which , for several centuries , had given him a mystical authority .

The final version , which became `` Under Pressure '' , evolved from a jam session that Bowie had with the band at Queen 's studio in Montreux , Switzerland . It was credited as being co-written by the five musicians . The scat singing that dominates much of the song is evidence of the jam - beginnings as improvisation . However , according to Queen bassist John Deacon ( as quoted in a French magazine in 1984 ) , the song 's primary musical songwriter was Freddie Mercury -- though all contributed to the arrangement . Brian May recalled to Mojo magazine , in October 2008 , that , `` It was hard , because you had four very precocious boys and David , who was precocious enough for all of us . David took over the song lyrically . Looking back , it 's a great song but it should have been mixed differently . Freddie and David had a fierce battle over that .

Upon seeing the clip , a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was `` really funny '' , but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as on the top floor of the GE Building , when it was really on the sixth floor .

This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity . The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later , after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century ; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed .","title":"Cell nucleus","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"856739896_8149-8660-0-511","score":11.4792528152,"text":"Birth control in the United States\nIn the early 1950s , philanthropist Katharine McCormick had provided funding for biologist Gregory Pincus to develop the birth control pill , which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in 1960 .

Courts imply terms , as a general rule , when the express terms of a contract leave a gap to be filled . Given their basic attachment to contractual freedom , the courts are reluctant to override express terms for contracting parties . Legislation can also be a source of implied terms , and may be overridden by agreement of the parties , or have a compulsory character . For contracts in general , individualised terms are implied ( terms `` implied in fact '' ) to reflect the `` reasonable expectations of the parties '' , and like the process of interpretation , implication of a term of a commercial contract must follow from its commercial setting . In Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman the House of Lords held ( in a notorious decision ) that `` guaranteed annuity rate '' policy holders of the life insurance company could not have their bonus rates lowered by the directors , when the company was in financial difficulty , if it would undermine all the policy holders ' `` reasonable expectations '' . Lord Steyn said that a term should be implied in the policy contract that the directors ' discretion was limited , as this term was `` strictly necessary ... essential to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties '' . This objective , contextual formulation of the test for individualised implied terms represents a shift from the older and subjective formulation of the implied term test , asking like an `` officious bystander '' what the parties `` would have contracted for '' if they had applied their minds to a gap in the contract . In AG of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd , Lord Hoffmann in the Privy Council added that the process of implication is to be seen as part of the overall process of interpretation : designed to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in their context .

Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period .","title":"History of the Great Wall of China","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"846282869_10357-11574-0-1217","score":24.4607658386,"text":"Great Wall of China\nUnlike the earlier fortifications , the Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth .

Qi Jiguang between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall , faced sections of the ram - earth wall with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping to warn of approaching Mongol raiders . During the 1440s -- 1460s , the Ming also built a so - called `` Liaodong Wall '' . Similar in function to the Great Wall ( whose extension , in a sense , it was ) , but more basic in construction , the Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong province , protecting it against potential incursions by Jurched - Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north .

When King Huiwen died , his widow the Queen Dowager Xuan acted as regent because the succeeding sons were deemed too young to govern . During the reign of King Zhaoxiang ( r . 306 -- 251 BC ) , the queen dowager apparently entered illicit relations with the Yiqu king and gave birth to two of his sons , but later tricked and killed the Yiqu king . Following that coup , the Qin army marched into Yiqu territory at the queen dowager 's orders ; the Qin annihilated the Yiqu remnants and thus came to possess the Ordos region . At this point the Qin built a wall around their new territories to defend against the true nomads even further north , incorporating the Wei walls .

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ?

'' Meanwhile , the writers also approached the concept of Rachel 's pregnancy and baby tentatively , worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends `` to become a show about a baby '' while `` On the other hand , we do n't want to pretend that there is n't one . '' According to Robert Bianco of USA Today , the critical success and popularity of Rachel 's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for `` propel ( ling ) the show to the top of the ratings '' .

However , the episode nearly went unwritten because , at the time , few Friends writers were expecting the couple 's relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became . The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows ; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple 's dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive `` he 's pining , she 's oblivious '' pattern , using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel . Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high , `` The One Where Rachel Finds Out '' became Friends ' most reworked episode . The couple 's first kiss at the end of season two 's `` The One Where Ross Finds Out '' was met with deafening applause from the studio audience . Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging . Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph believes that they accomplished this by `` dangl ( ing ) the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together .

The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast .

Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc .

The very act of putting on a play by Shakespeare , formerly condemned as a `` bourgeois Western imperialist author '' whom no Chinese could respect , was in and of itself an act of quiet dissent . Of all Shakespeare 's plays , the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was Macbeth , as Chinese audiences saw in a play first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland a parallel with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s . The violence and bloody chaos of Macbeth reminded Chinese audiences of the violence and bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution , and furthermore , the story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power - hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays . Some of Shakespeare 's plays , particularly the history plays , were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto ( i.e. pamphlet ) form ; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition .","title":"Shakespeare's reputation","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"840297813_6083-7053-0-970","score":18.7495880127,"text":"Shakespeare's reputation\nDuring the Interregnum ( 1642 -- 1660 ) , all public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers .

Shakespeare was among the many playwrights whose works were plundered for these scenes . Among the most common scenes were Bottom 's scenes from A Midsummer Night 's Dream and the gravedigger 's scene from Hamlet . When the theatres opened again in 1660 after this uniquely long and sharp break in British theatrical history , two newly licensed London theatre companies , the Duke 's and the King 's Company , started business with a scramble for performance rights to old plays .

The date of the first performance is unknown . The First Quarto , printed in 1597 , says that `` it hath been often ( and with great applause ) plaid publiquely '' , setting the first performance before that date . The Lord Chamberlain 's Men were certainly the first to perform it . Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare , the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors , Will Kemp , instead of Peter , in a line in Act Five . Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo , being the company 's actor , and Master Robert Goffe ( a boy ) the first Juliet . The premiere is likely to have been at `` The Theatre '' , with other early productions at `` The Curtain '' .

Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families , arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet 's passion for each other . That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers ' language : Juliet , for example , speaks of `` my only love sprung from my only hate '' and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo 's death . This leads on to speculation as to the playwright 's psychology , in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare 's grief for the death of his son , Hamnet .","title":"Romeo and Juliet","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"850145037_12734-13858-0-1124","score":12.6554002762,"text":"Mail order\nThonet brothers 1859 ( GER ) Royal Welsh Warehouse 1861 ( UK ) Montgomery Ward : 1872 ( US ) Hammacher Schlemmer : 1881 ( US ; claims to be the longest - running catalog in the U.S. ) Eaton 's : 1884 ( Canada ) Sears : 1888 ( US ) Universal Stores : 1900 ( UK ) Freemans : 1905 ( UK ) Spiegel Inc. 1905 ( US ) Empire : 1907 ( UK ) Grattan : 1912 ( UK ) L.L.

This was suggested by Edward Taube in his article `` The Sense of `` Horse '' in the Horse Latitudes '' ( Journal of Geography , October 1967 ) . He argued the maritime use of ' horsed ' described a ship that was being carried along by an ocean current or tide in the manner of a rider on horseback .

Horses are adapted by evolution to inhabit an ecological niche characterized by poor quality vegetation . Advocates assert that most current mustang herds live in arid areas which cattle can not fully utilize due to the lack of water sources . They can cover vast distances to find food and water ; advocates assert that horses range 5 - 10 times as far as cattle to find forage , finding it in more inaccessible areas . In addition , horses are `` hindgut fermenters '' , meaning that they digest nutrients by means of the cecum rather than by a multi-chambered stomach . While this means that they extract less energy from a given amount of forage , it also means that they can digest food faster and make up the difference in efficiency by increasing their consumption rate . In practical effect , by eating greater quantities , horses can obtain adequate nutrition from poorer forage than can ruminants such as cattle , surviving in areas where cattle will starve .

In West Germany these represented a major voting block ; maintaining a strong culture of grievance and victimhood against Soviet Power , pressing for a continued commitment to full German reunification , claiming compensation , pursuing the right of return to lost property in the East , and opposing any recognition of the postwar extension of Poland and the Soviet Union into former German lands . Due to the Cold War rhetoric and successful political machinations of Konrad Adenauer , this block eventually became substantially aligned with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany ; although in practice ' westward - looking ' CDU policies favouring the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union worked against the possibility of achieving the objectives of the expellee population from the east through negotiation with the Soviet Union . But for Adenauer , fostering and encouraging unrealistic demands and uncompromising expectations amongst the expellees would serve his `` Policy of Strength '' by which West Germany contrived to inhibit consideration of unification or a final Peace Treaty until the West was strong enough to face the Soviets on equal terms . Consequently , the Federal Republic in the 1950s adopted much of the symbolism of expellee groups ; especially in appropriating and subverting the terminology and imagery of the Holocaust ; applying this to post-war German experience instead .

Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross the mountains and force temperatures to drop to about 12 \u00b0 F ( \u2212 11 \u00b0 C ) in central North Carolina . Still , temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of the mountains . The coldest ever recorded temperature in North Carolina was \u2212 34 \u00b0 F ( \u2212 37 \u00b0 C ) on January 21 , 1985 , at Mount Mitchell . The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream . The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still higher than the average ocean temperature in Maine during July . Snow is common in the mountains , although many ski resorts use snowmaking equipment to make sure there is always snow on their land . North Carolina 's relative humidity is highest in the winter .","title":"Climate of North Carolina","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"842960242_36438-36883-0-445","score":20.8197307587,"text":"North Carolina\nNorth Carolina experiences severe weather in both summer and winter , with summer bringing threat of hurricanes , tropical storms , heavy rain , and flooding .

Tornadoes have been known to occur during this time period , the most notable recent example being in 1999 when an F2 tornado struck downtown Salt Lake City , causing extensive damage and resulting in one death . Many of these thunderstorms consist of dry lightning , which occurs when humidity is too low to support rainfall and the rain evaporates before reaching the ground . This is the main cause of wildfires in Utah during summer . Smoke from such fires in nearby areas sometimes make their way into the valley . Despite the intensity of the thunderstorms , the low humidity , short duration , and isolationism of the thunderstorms all play a part in making this the driest season . July is the driest month , with only 0.72 in ( 18.3 mm ) of precipitation on average . In late fall , the Pacific Ocean usually begins to kick in again , and starting in late September precipitation begins to increase . During late summer and fall , remnants of tropical cyclones from the East Pacific occasionally reach Utah , resulting in heavy tropical rains . Weather events such as hail , freezing rain , and sleet are uncommon in Salt Lake City . When they do occur , they are of short duration and rarely accumulate . The record precipitation for a single month occurred in September 1982 , with 7.04 inches ( 179 mm ) , largely due to the remnants of Hurricane Olivia .

In 2010 the largest producers of gold , in order , were China , Australia , U.S. , South Africa and Russia . The country with the largest unmined gold deposits is Australia . Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth . `` As an economy 's productive capacity grows , then so should its money supply . Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal , then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow . '' Mainstream economists believe that economic recessions can be largely mitigated by increasing the money supply during economic downturns . A gold standard means that the money supply would be determined by the gold supply and hence monetary policy could no longer be used to stabilize the economy . The gold standard is often blamed for prolonging the Great Depression , as under the gold standard , central banks could not expand credit at a fast enough rate to offset deflationary forces . Although the gold standard brings long - run price stability , it is historically associated with high short - run price volatility . It has been argued by Schwartz , among others , that instability in short - term price levels can lead to financial instability as lenders and borrowers become uncertain about the value of debt . Deflation punishes debtors . Real debt burdens therefore rise , causing borrowers to cut spending to service their debts or to default . Lenders become wealthier , but may choose to save some of the additional wealth , reducing GDP . The money supply would essentially be determined by the rate of gold production . When gold stocks increase more rapidly than the economy , there is inflation and the reverse is also true . The consensus view is that the gold standard contributed to the severity and length of the Great Depression . Hamilton contended that the gold standard is susceptible to speculative attacks when a government 's financial position appears weak . Conversely , this threat discourages governments from engaging in risky policy ( see moral hazard ) . For example , the U.S. was forced to contract the money supply and raise interest rates in September 1931 to defend the dollar after speculators forced the UK off the gold standard .","title":"Gold standard","source":"https?:\/\/(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&\/=]*)*\\b"},{"document_id":"827880905_32815-33179-0-364","score":8.8210926056,"text":"Maldives\nFor us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do , it is in our economic self - interest ...
