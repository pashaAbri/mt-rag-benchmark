These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00612-7-2163", "score": 19.906143188476562, "text": "\nMigration overview \n\nThe [IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant) database-as-a-service offering is a JSON document store that runs on multi-tenant clusters.

The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned. The default for partitioned is false, maintaining compatibility with an earlier version.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00512-1696-3972", "score": 19.62567138671875, "text": "\nDocuments with similar document IDs are unlikely to be placed onto the same shard.\n\nA non-partitioned database offers only global querying, described in more detail later.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases \n\nA partitioned database is the newest type of IBM Cloudant database. Within a partitioned database, documents are formed into logical partitions by use of a partition key. The partition key is part of the document ID for documents within a partitioned database. All documents are assigned to a partition, and many documents are typically given the same partition key. A partition's primary JSON data and its indexes end up colocated, meaning that the database can query data within a partition more efficiently.\n\nA partitioned database offers both partitioned and global querying. Partitioned querying takes advantage of the data layout within the database cluster to deliver improved and more scalable query performance. Partition queries are also often cheaper than global queries.\n\nAs partitioned databases offer the advantages of both global and partition querying, IBM Cloudant recommends that new applications take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n What makes a good partition key? \n\nIf you're thinking of using IBM Cloudant's new partitioned database feature, then the choice of a partition key is important. A partition key must have:\n\n\n\n* Many values - lots of small partitions are better than a few large ones. A million partitions are perfectly fine, but keep each partition under 10 GB in total size.\n* No hot spots - avoid designing a system that makes one partition handle a high proportion of the workload. If the work is evenly distributed around the partitions, the database performs more smoothly.\n* Repeating - If each partition key is unique, one document per partition exists. To get the best out of partitioned databases, multiple documents per partition must exist - documents that logically belong together.\n\n\n\nLet's look at some use cases and some good and bad choices for a partition key.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Exceeding this limit causes a [413 error](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).\n\nIBM Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem) model for data. If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field. The _id field is detailed in the next section.\n* A _rev field. The _rev field is a revision identifier, and is [essential to the IBM Cloudant replication protocol](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-document-versioning-and-mvccdocument-versioning-and-mvcc).\n\n\n\nIn addition to these two mandatory fields, documents can generally contain any other content that can be described by using JSON, subject to some caveats detailed in the following sections.\n\n\n\n Document IDs", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-documents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12897-7-1911", "score": 19.464689254760742, "text": "\nDocument versioning and MVCC \n\n[Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control) is how IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae databases ensures that all of the nodes in a database's cluster contain only the [newest version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-documents) of a document.\n\nSince IBM Cloudant databases are [eventually consistent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theorem), it is necessary to prevent inconsistencies from arising between nodes as a result of synchronizing between outdated documents.\n\nMulti-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) enables concurrent read and write access to an IBM Cloudant database. MVCC is a form of [optimistic concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control). It makes both read and write operations on IBM Cloudant databases faster because the database locks on either read or write operations isn't necessary. MVCC also enables synchronization between IBM Cloudant database nodes.\n\n\n\n Revisions \n\nEvery document in an IBM Cloudant database has a _rev field that indicates its revision number.\n\nA revision number is added to your documents by the server when you insert or modify them. The number is included in the server response when you make changes or read a document. The _rev value is constructed by using a combination of a simple counter and a hash of the document.\n\nThe two main uses of the revision number are to help in the following cases:\n\n\n\n1. Determine what documents must be replicated between servers.\n2. Confirm that a client is trying to modify the latest version of a document.\n\n\n\nYou must specify the previous _rev when you [update a document](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-documentsupdate) or else your request fails and returns a [409 error](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-document-versioning-and-mvcc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-4796-6846", "score": 19.433656692504883, "text": "\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-26901-28959", "score": 19.29539680480957, "text": "\nIf we want to fetch a single document back from the database, then documents sit one level beneath the database in the hierarchy of the URL.\n\nSo acurl $URL/books/id means \"get document ID from the database books from the IBM Cloudant service at the supplied URL\".\n\nNotice the hierarchy: service, database, and document.\n\nSo far we only used the GET HTTP method, which is the default one for curl and the one used when you enter a URL into your web browser.\n\nIBM Cloudant's API often uses the HTTP method as a verb to describe the action that is asked of the database: GET for fetching data.\n\nWith curl, we can specify the method that we want to use with the -X command-line option.\n\nSo to write a new document to our books database that uses the API, we're going to use the POST method, massing a document as the body of the HTTP request.\n\nacurl -X POST specifies we're using the POST HTTP method. -d specifies the document that we want to write, which is sent as the body of the request, and finally, the URL we are writing to which is $URL/books - the books database.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the PUT method, if we are supplying the ID of the document that is being written.

The total number of tokens in the bucket represents the number of paths that can be purged in a burst.\n\nIn the following table, X-RateLimit-Purge-Paths-Limit-Burst represents the number of tokens that the bucket can hold. The initial token bucket is full. Tokens are constantly added to this bucket based on the sustained rate (X-RateLimit-Purge-Paths-Limit-Per-Second). However, if the bucket is full, no more tokens can be added.\n\nWhen a multiple file purge request is made, the remaining number of tokens is checked against the number of file paths. The paths bucket must contain enough tokens to satisfy all of the paths in the request.

In other words, changes might not appear in strict time order. The reason is that data is returned from multiple IBM Cloudant nodes, and eventual consistency rules apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication pitfalls \n\nTo replicate successfully, the sum of the document size and all attachment sizes must be less than the maximum request size of the target cluster. For example, if the maximum HTTP request size is 11 MB, then the following scenarios apply:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Various scenarios based on maximum HTTP request size 11 MB\n\n Document size Attachment size Total size Replicates? \n\n 1 MB Five 2-MB attachments 11 MB Yes \n 1 MB One 10-MB attachment 11 MB Yes \n 1 MB One hundred 1-MB attachments 101 MB No \n\n\n\nSeveral considerations apply when you use replication.\n\n\n\n Incorrect user permissions \n\nFor replication to proceed optimally when you replicate from database \"a\" to database \"b\", the credentials that are supplied must have:\n\n\n\n* _reader and _replicator permissions on database \"a\".\n* _writer permissions on database \"b\".\n\n\n\nAPI keys are generated in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard or through the [API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant). Each key can be given individual permissions that relate to a specific IBM Cloudant database. IBM Cloudant must be able to write its checkpoint documents at the \"read\" end of replication, otherwise no state is saved and replication cannot resume from where it stopped. If the state is not saved, it can lead to performance problems when replication of large data sets resumes. The reason is that without checkpoints, the replication process restarts from the beginning each time that it is resumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Replication document is conflicted \n\nAnother consequence of setting user permissions incorrectly is that the _replicator document becomes conflicted. The _replicator document records the current state of the replication process.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16326-3092-4450", "score": 18.324596405029297, "text": "\nYou can visualize how your assistant would look as a web chat widget on your organization's website.

The responses from your assistant are defined by you and can be written in any language you want.\n\nHowever, some of the phrases that are displayed in the web chat widget are part of the web chat itself and do not come from the assistant. By default, these hardcoded phrases are specified in English, but you can apply a different language by adding lines to the embedded web chat script.\n\nThe hardcoded phrases used by the web chat widget are specified in language pack files. The web chat provides language packs that contain translations of each English-language phrase that is used by the web chat. You can instruct the web chat to use one of these other languages files by using the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nLikewise, the web chat applies an American English locale to content that is added by the web chat unless you specify something else. The locale setting affects how values such as dates and times are formatted.\n\nTo configure the web chat for customers outside the US, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.  To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.  To change only the language of the hardcoded English phrases, use the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nFor more information, see [Instance methods](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslanguages).\n3.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-12876-14604", "score": 18.16175651550293, "text": "\nIf your CSP uses a nonce to add elements such as <script> and <style> tags to an allowlist, do not use unsafe-inline to allow all such elements.

Information passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private context variable. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for a standard customer.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

For example, you must keep up with browser support changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and design the layout and styling. The time you spend designing and maintaing a UI can be better spent building a quality assistant instead. When you use the web chat integration, you can rely on us to manage the user interface, so you can focus on designing conversational exchanges that address the unique business needs of your customers. Cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research is incorporated into the web chat to deliver an exceptional user experience.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy the web chat, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16375-7-1735", "score": 18.909719467163086, "text": "\nAdding the web chat to your mobile application \n\nIf you have a mobile application built on a mobile framework such as iOS, Android, or React Native, you can use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to communicate between your app and the Watson Assistant web chat.\n\nUsing WebViews with a JavaScript bridge is a common pattern with a similar implementation for all mobile frameworks.\n\n\n\n Including the web chat as a WebView \n\nYou can include the web chat interface as part of a page of your mobile app, or as a separate panel that your app opens.

You can tag related resources and view them throughout your account by filtering by tags from your resource list.\n\nTo see a full list of tags in your account, go to Manage > Account in the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, and select Tags.\n\nYou can apply user tags to organize your resources and service IDs and easily find them later. User tags can also help you with identifying specific team usage or cost allocation. By creating access management tags, you can control access to your resources and service IDs without requiring updates to your IAM policies.\n\n\n\n Tagging rules \n\nTags are not case-sensitive, and the maximum length of a tag is 128 characters. The permitted characters are A-Z, 0-9, spaces, underscore, hyphen, period, and colon. The only supported format for access management tags is key:value. The use of a colon formats the tag into a string that isolates two logical parts, like a env:dev pair. A comma separates multiple tags and can't be used within the tag name itself.\n\nTags are visible account-wide and can be replicated across geographic regions. Since tags are not regulated information, avoid creating tags that use personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, or other identifying or proprietary information.\n\n\n\n Sample tags and syntax \n\nYou can apply tags to help you organize and manage your resources, service IDs, and access policies.

The operation cost is low even when compared to the significant amounts of IO required to stream hundreds or even thousands of documents from the on-disk storage.\n\nAt a deeper level, when a node receives a view request, it asks the nodes that hold the shard replicas of the view's database for the results of the view request from the documents in each shard. As it receives the answers, taking the first answer for each shard replica, the node that services the view request combines the results and streams the final result to the client. As more documents are involved, it takes longer for each replica to stream the results from disk and across the network. The node that services the request also has much more work to do in combining the results from each database shard.\n\nOverall, the goal is for a view request to require the minimum amount of data from each shard. This practice minimizes the time that the data is in transit and being combined to form the final result. Using the power of views to precompute aggregate data is one way to achieve this aim. This practice reduces the time that your application spends waiting for the request to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n How can I de-normalize my data? \n\nIn relational databases, normalizing data is often the most efficient way to store data. This practice makes sense when you can use JOIN to easily combine data from multiple tables. You're more likely to need an HTTP GET request for each piece of data with IBM Cloudant. If you reduce the number of requests you need to build a complete picture of a modeled entity, you can present information to your users more quickly.\n\nBy using views, you get many of the benefits of normalized data while you maintain the de-normalized version for efficiency.\n\nAs an example, in a relational schema, you'd normally represent tags in a separate table and use a connecting table to join tags with their associated documents. This practice allows quick lookup of all documents with a specific tag.\n\nIn IBM Cloudant, you'd store tags in a list in each document.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq"}]}

In case you are using asynchronous calls, for example, when fetching data from Cloud Object Storage or Cloudant instances, it is unpredictable as to when the main() function fully completes its work. To ensure that the action runs to completion, use a Promise. A Promise in Node.js is a stand-in for an object. Using a promise allows you to return the object from a synchronous function immediately, but the actual result becomes available at a later point in time, when the promise is fulfilled.\n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions Node.js runtime container supports promises that are returned from the main() function. If you prefer working in a more synchronous fashion, you can also declare your main() function as an async function, which allows you to wait for asynchronous calls to complete before the function continues.\n\nExamples:\n\nfunction main() {\nreturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n...doGet(callback => {\nresolve(); // <-- this terminates action execution, as the Promise got resolved\n});\n...\ntry {\n...some synchronous code...\n} catch(e) {\n...log error...\nreject(e); // <-- this also terminates the execution, but reports the failure back to the runtime\n}\n});\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n...some synchronous code...\nawait doGet(....)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-ts_action_nodejs_fails"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06320-4083-5561", "score": 15.840176582336426, "text": "\nWARNING: A manual nodetool repair or a repair operation from the OpsCenter node administration menu fails to run if a NodeSync-enabled table is targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n Recommendations \n\n\n\n Benchmark before production \n\n\n\n* Do not use cqlsh and COPY for benchmarking, as COPY does not mimic typical client behavior.

In an upcoming release, volume attachments returned in the boot_volume_attachment and volume_attachments[] properties of an instance will not include the volume sub-property if the volume has not yet been provisioned. Such volumes are currently represented with empty crn, id, and href properties along with an undocumented sentinel value for name.\n\nTo prepare for this change, verify that your client checks that the volume property exists for a volume attachment before attempting to access its crn, id, href, or name sub-properties.\n\nAsynchronous DELETE response code change. In an upcoming release, the response code output for asynchronous DELETE operations will change from 204 to 202.

Community Kubernetes worker nodes run on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64, 16.04 x86_64 (deprecated). \n Cluster networking Your worker nodes are created in a VPC subnet in the zone that you specify. By default, the public and private cloud service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPC VPN on the private network. \n App networking You can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

These applications and tenants require isolation from each other for security, fault isolation, and avoiding overlapping IP addressing issues. The NSX logical switch creates logical broadcast domains or segments (VXLAN vWires) to which an application or tenant virtual machine can be logically wired. This feature allows for flexibility and speed of deployment while still providing all the characteristics of a physical network's broadcast domains (VLANs) without physical Layer 2 sprawl. Logical switches allow for thousands of tenant networks to be provisioned onto a single IBM Cloud private network (VLAN). A logical switch is distributed and can span arbitrarily large compute clusters, even across pods within the same data center. This distribution allows for virtual machine mobility within the data center without limitations of physical Layer 2 (VLAN) boundaries across pods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logical routers \n\nDynamic routing provides the necessary forwarding information between Layer 2 broadcast domains (VXLAN, vWires, Logical Switches). This routing decreases Layer 2 broadcast domains and improve network efficiency and scale. NSX extends this intelligence where the workloads reside for providing East-West routing functions. This extension allows more direct virtual machine to virtual machine communication without the costly or timely need to extend hops. NSX also provides North-South connectivity inbound and outbound of IBM Cloud data centers, thus enabling tenants to access public networks securely and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logical firewall \n\nLogical firewall provides security mechanisms for dynamic virtual data centers.

Queries of this type use Discovery Query Language syntax to define the search criteria.\n\nParameter name: query\n\nNatural Language Query (NLQ)\n: Finds answers to queries that are written in natural language. NLQ requests accept a text string value.\n\nParameter name: natural_language_query\n\nAlong with the query that you specify by using one of the supported query types, you can include one or both of the following parameters. The values for these parameters are also specified by using the Discovery Query Language (DQL) syntax:\n\n\n\n* filter\n* aggregation\n\n\n\nFor more information about the Discovery Query Language, see [DQL overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-dql-overview).\n\nQueries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. A few other supported parameters are specified and given default values based on the project type in use. For more information, see [Default query settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-defaults).\n\nDiscovery does not log query request data.

Once your content is uploaded and enriched by Discovery, you can build queries, then integrate Discovery into your own projects, or create a custom application by using the Watson Explorer Application Builder.\n\nThe queries you write vary by collection because all collections contain unique content.\n\nWhen you create a query or filter, Discovery looks at each result and tries to match the paths you define. When matches occur, they are added to the results set. When creating a query, you can be as vague or as specific as you want. The more specific the query, the more targeted the results.\n\nYou can write natural language queries (such as \"IBM Watson partnerships\") using the Discovery tooling or the API.\n\n\n\n Default query behavior \n\n\n\n* Stemming is applied to queries by default, which means that results match the root form of words. In contrast, stemming does not allow for matching on any arbitrary substring of a term. For example, words such as \"connections,\" \"connective,\" and \"connected\" are reduced to \"connect.\" But words such as \"boatbuilding,\" \"boathouse,\" and \"boatload,\" are not reduced to \"boat.\"\n* Tokenization occurs using a set of standard separators per language including whitespace, hyphen, underscore, and punctuation marks for English. For more information, see [Creating custom tokenization dictionaries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptstokenization).\n* All private collections return a confidence score in the query results in most cases.

For example, if you query for aqui, you receive results for both aqui and aqu\u00ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Options for querying \n\n\n\n* You have the option to turn on passage retrieval.

When synonyms are defined, the customer does not need to submit an exact phrase or keyword that your project is trained to understand. Even variations of the term are recognized and used to find the best results. For example, you can expand a query for ibm to include international business machines and big blue. Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary. Dictionary synonyms are recognized and tagged at the time that a document is ingested. The synonyms that you define are recognized and tagged as occurrences of the associated dictionary term, so that they can be retrieved later by search.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-41116-43256", "score": 24.724510192871094, "text": "\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list. It contains data that is sorted by the fields you specify, for example, books that are sorted by date and title. If you perform a query that asks for data that matches a document's date and title, the indexed data structure can be used to speed up the query process. Instead of scanning through every document in turn, IBM Cloudant can jump to the relevant part of the index (say, the section on 20th century books) and retrieve the data much more quickly.\n\nIBM Cloudant Query indexes include two types of indexes: type=json and type=text. These indexes are backed by two underlying indexing technologies that we meet in subsequent parts of this course.\n\nAn index is defined when you POST some JSON to a database's _index endpoint.\n\nThe index object contains a fields array, which specifies which document attributes to index. Usually, the fields that need indexing are equivalent to the attributes used in the selector of a query you're going to use to retrieve the data. That is, if you need to query by the date field, we need to index the date field.\n\nAlthough the name of an index is optional, it's good practice and we follow this convention. It's good to ask IBM Cloudant a question and specify the name of the index you intend it to use. This practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard. Select the database, then choose the Design Documents tab and Query Indexes from the menu.\n\nAny existing indexes are listed on the side: A special index must exist that represents the primary index, based on the document's _id.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "score": 24.63377571105957, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise. Devise your own IBM Cloudant Query that finds the titles of books that are written in the 20th Century. The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called Indexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Indexing video \n\nLearn how indexing can speed up your query process.\n\n\n\n* Indexing video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 11 - Indexing.\n\nThe queries that we executed in the previous part were not optimal: to get the answer, IBM Cloudant had to spool through every document in the database in turn to see whether it met with the search criteria.\n\nTo make queries that are run in a performant and scalable way, we need Indexing.\n\nWith IBM Cloudant, you can specify any number of Indexes (or indices).\n\nAn index is a secondary data structure that is built from the document list.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00579-2977-4822", "score": 24.327045440673828, "text": "\n* IBM Cloudant guide to using [views](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-viewsusing-views)\n* Performance implications of using [include_docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-viewsmulti-document-fetching)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Never rely on the default behavior of IBM Cloudant Query\u2019s no-indexing \n\nIt\u2019s tempting to rely on IBM Cloudant Query's ability to query without creating explicit indexes. This practice is costly in terms of performance, as every lookup is a full scan of the database rather than an indexed lookup. If your data is small, this full-scan lookup doesn\u2019t matter, but as the data set grows, performance becomes a problem for you, and for the cluster as a whole. It is likely that we will limit this facility soon. The IBM Cloudant Dashboard provides a method for creating indexes in an easy way.\n\nCreating indexes and crafting IBM Cloudant Queries that take advantage of them requires some flair. To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index. Some examples exist where this type of indexing is abused either deliberately, or mostly by mistake. Plan your indexing to comprise only the fields required by your actual queries. Indexes take up space and can be costly to rebuild if the number of indexed fields are large.\n\nWe also have the issue of which fields that you store in an IBM Cloudant Search.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-37889-39953", "score": 24.051494598388672, "text": "\nIf you need to access objects within documents, you can use standard dot notation for example, address.zipcode to access a postal code string inside an address object.\n\nWe can also add the following parameters:\n\nFields\n: Specifies the document attributes that we want returned (the default is the entire document).\n\nSort\n: Defines how the data is to be sorted.

ORDER and LIMIT are exactly equivalent, and the IBM Cloudant Query FIELDS list is equivalent to the comma-separated list of attributes after the SELECT keyword.\n\nThe JSON syntax might take a bit of getting used to, but MongoDB users might find it familiar.\n\nIBM Cloudant queries can be executed in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.

You can use a json or text type of index with IBM Cloudant.\n\nIn the following cases, you can specify how the index is created by making it of type json:\n\n\n\n* You know exactly what data you want to look for.\n* You want to keep storage and processing requirements to a minimum.\n\n\n\nBut for maximum flexibility when you search for data, you typically create an index of type text. Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to /$DATABASE/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body. The type field of the JSON object must be set to json. A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST /$DATABASE/_index HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00639-7-2032", "score": 23.677379608154297, "text": "\nSelector syntax \n\nThe IBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae Query language is expressed as a JSON object that describes documents of interest. Within this structure, you can apply conditional logic by using specially named fields.\n\nThe IBM Cloudant Query language has some similarities with MongoDB query documents, but these similarities arise from a commonality of purpose and don't necessarily extend to equivalence of function or result.\n\n\n\n Selector basics \n\nElementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values needed for those fields. The following example selector matches all documents that have a director field that contains the value Lars von Trier.\n\nSee the following example of a simple selector:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"director\": \"Lars von Trier\"\n}\n}\n\nIf you created a full text index by specifying \"type\":\"text\" when the index was created, you can use the $text operator to select matching documents. In the following example, the full text index is inspected to find any document that contains the word Bond.\n\nSee the following example of a simple selector for a full_text index:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"$text\": \"Bond\"\n}\n}\n\nYou can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators. However, for IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type json, you can't use \"combination\" or \"array logical\" operators such as $regex as the basis of a query. Only the equality operators such as $eq, $gt, $gte, $lt, and $lte - but not$ne - can be used as the basis of a more complex query. For more information about creating complex selector expressions, see [Creating selector expressions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-selector-syntaxcreating-selector-expressions).\n\n\n\n\n\n Selector with two fields \n\nIn the following example, the selector matches any document with a name field that contains Paul, and that also has a location field with the value \"Boston\".\n\nSee the following example of a more complex selector:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"name\": \"Paul\",\n\"location\": \"Boston\"\n}", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-selector-syntax"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-60601-62822", "score": 23.63479232788086, "text": "\nWhen you create a secondary index, you choose whether its purpose is for per-partition or global scope.\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00472-7-1792", "score": 23.39948272705078, "text": "\nUsing IBM Cloudant Search \n\nSearch indexes provide a way to query a database by using [Lucene Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_3_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.htmlOverview). A search index uses one or more fields from your documents.\n\nYou can use a search index to run queries, find documents based on the content they include, or work with groups, facets, or geographical searches.\n\nTo create a search index, you add a JavaScript function to a design document in the database. An index builds after it processes one search request or after the server detects a document update. The index function takes the following parameters:\n\n\n\n1. Field name - The name of the field you want to use when you query the index. If you set this parameter to default, then this field is queried if no field is specified in the query syntax.\n2. Data that you want to index, for example, doc.address.country.\n3. (Optional) The third parameter includes the following fields: boost, facet, index, and store. These fields are described in more detail later.\n\n\n\nBy default, a search index response returns 25 rows. The number of rows that is returned can be changed by using the limit parameter. However, a result set from a search is limited to 200 rows. Each response includes a bookmark field. You can include the value of the bookmark field in later queries to look through the responses.\n\nYou can query the API by using one of the following methods: URI, IBM Cloudant Dashboard, curl, or a browser plug-in, such as Postman or RESTClient.\n\nSee the following example design document that defines a search index:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"_design/search_example\",\n\"indexes\": {\n\"animals\": {\n\"index\": \"function(doc){ ... }\"\n}\n}\n}\n\n\n\n Search index partitioning type", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-search"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-42802-44973", "score": 23.268714904785156, "text": "\nThis practice saves IBM Cloudant from having to choose which index to use from the available ones, and it makes it easy for you to remember which index is which.\n\nLet's create an index on our books database from the dashboard. Select the database, then choose the Design Documents tab and Query Indexes from the menu.\n\nAny existing indexes are listed on the side: A special index must exist that represents the primary index, based on the document's _id.\n\nComplete the index definition with the JSON:\n\nClick Create Index when you're done.\n\nClicking the button sends a POST request to the _index endpoint (other API calls are available to update and delete existing indexes).\n\nIndexes are built asynchronously by IBM Cloudant in the background. For large databases, it can take IBM Cloudant some time to construct the index for the first time. The index cannot use the database until that initial build is ready.\n\nWe can repeat our query for books in the 20th century. This time we specify the index name with the use_index field. The answer returns - this time powered by our index. You might not notice a speed improvement for a small database, but the benefit is definitely felt as your data size and query volume grows. Indexing helps your queries remain performant as your application scales.\n\nWhen you tell IBM Cloudant to create a secondary index, it starts a background task that looks at all the documents in turn and creates a new data structure on disk: the index. The index is a balanced tree which pairs the keys (the attribute or attributes that you need indexed) with the document _id they came from.\n\nThe index can be used to efficiently lookup known keys and ranges of keys without having to rescan the entire database.\n\nAnother trick that you can employ at index time is the partial filter. You can optionally supply a partial filter in your index definition. This IBM Cloudant Query selector is executed at index time to decide which documents' data makes it to the index and which are ignored.\n\nIn this example, a selector is employed that allows only dates that fall on a weekend to make it to the index. Smaller indexes are faster and more efficient.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}]}

Human annotators need to understand which entity type to apply to a mention given the context, and know which relation types are valid for a given pair of mentions. Examples drawn from your domain content are often the best way to convey the correct annotation choices to make.\n\nAnnotation guidelines are not static. As your project evolves, you'll likely discover instances of mentions and relationships that are not accurately captured in the guidelines. And you'll likely discover inconsistencies between multiple human annotators who interpret the guidelines in different ways. By updating the guidelines as situations arise, you can help improve the accuracy and consistency of annotations over time.\n\nBefore documents can be considered ground truth, any conflicts between how different human annotators annotated the same documents must be resolved. A key way to resolve the conflicts is by discussing what caused the confusion, thus helping human annotators learn from their mistakes. Improving and clarifying the guidelines can help reduce the number of conflicts and help ensure that accurately and consistently annotated documents are promoted to ground truth.\n\nTo help you manage the guidelines, you might want to divide what could become a long document into multiple parts, such as guidelines for annotating entities, guidelines for annotating relations, and guidelines for annotating the ways that mentions can be coreferenced.

[Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-preregister).\n\n\n\n\n\n What are authentication events? \n\nAn authentication event happens when you issue a new regular or anonymous access token. Tokens can be issued in response to a sign-in request that is initiated by the user, or by an app on behalf of the user. By default, your users' access tokens are valid for 1 hour and anonymous tokens are valid for 30 days. After the tokens expire, your users must create a new token to access protected resources.

An advanced authentication event happens when you issue tokens for advanced security features.\n\nBy default, advanced features are disabled. You incur an extra charge when you enable them. For example, if you obtain 10,000 access tokens, then you turn on password policy management and obtain 10,000 more. You would pay for 20,000 authentication events and 10,000 advanced security events. If you disable all the advanced features, your account reverts to the original-cost policy.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Instead, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for which every object version placed in the bucket should be protected. When you place an object in the bucket, a Retain Until Date is calculated for the object version by adding the specified duration to the time of the object write.\n\nIf your request to place an object version in a bucket contains an explicit retention mode and Retain Until Date, those settings override any bucket default settings for that object version.\n\nLike all other Object Lock settings, the Retain Until Date applies to individual object versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods.\n\nImagine an object that is 60 days into a 90-day retention period, and you overwrite that object with the same name and a two year retention period. The operation will succeed and a new version of the object with a two year retention period is created.

If a user request is received after the TTL has expired, the Edge server reaches out to the origin host to fetch the content. If the origin server cannot be reached for some reason (for instance, the origin host is down, or there is a network issue), the Edge server serves the expired (stale) content to the request. This feature is supported by Akamai and cannot be turned off.\n\n\n\n\n\n Support for multiple origins with distinct paths \n\nIn certain cases, you might want to deliver certain content from a different origin server. For example, you might want certain photos or videos that are served from different origin servers. IBM Cloud CDN provides the option to set up multiple origin servers with multiple paths. This allows flexibility with regards to how and where the data is stored.\n\nThe path that is specified for the origin server must be unique regarding the CDN. The origin server itself does not need to be unique.\n\n\n\n\n\n Time to Live (TTL) \n\nTime to Live indicates the amount of time (in seconds) the Edge server retains the cached content for that particular file or directory path. When a CDN is first created, a global TTL is created for path /* with a default time of 3600 seconds. The minimum value for TTL is 0 seconds, and the maximum value is 2147483647 seconds. For each entry, the TTL path must be unique for the CDN. If multiple paths match a given content, the most recently configured path match applies to that content. For example, consider two TTLs, /example/file created first with a time to live value of 3000 seconds and /example/* is created later, with a value of 4000 seconds. Although /example/file is more specific, /example/ was created most recently, so the TTL for /example/file is 4000 seconds. After creation, TTL entries can be edited for path, time, or both. TTL entries can also be deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n Token authentication \n\nToken authentication is the process of generating tokens, associating them with an authenticated user session, and validating the request by using these tokens to prevent unauthorized sharing of links to your content.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/CDN?topic=CDN-about-content-delivery-networks-cdn-"}]}

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions. This is typically defined as a DR architecture.\n\nThe benefits of using a [DR orchestrator](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-cloud-resiliency-orchestrator) are covered in the context of a cloud environment and its fast changing behavior. You might require several integrations with management tools and services in IBM Cloud\u00ae. Examples throughout these best practices are provided to demonstrate the native capabilities and documentation currently available to implement DR for IBM Cloud services and suggest additional services that are often required to implement an enterprise-level resiliency solution.\n\nThe best practices in this section are based on the services and features currently available and might change over time. We recommend that you verify possible changes or additional features that might apply to your environment.\n\n\n\n General disaster recovery strategy \n\nThe approach to defining your DR strategy needs to be systematic and start with the application or service, which is defined as a set of compute resources, for example Kubernetes apps, virtual machines, services, and more, that make up a business application.\n\nWhile a holistic approach might be wanted, the reality is that each business application (cloud service) is independent, with its own", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-dr"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12584-10119-11773", "score": 18.907184600830078, "text": "\nDisaster recovery includes tasks such as providing dependencies on disaster recovery sites, provision disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events.\n\n\n\nTable 5.

RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process.

With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

DevSecOps integrates a set of security and compliance controls into the DevOps processes. This feature allows organizations to deliver rapidly and often while they maintain a strong security posture and continuous state of audit-readiness.\n\nLike Agile and DevOps, DevSecOps introduces a culture change and removes the traditional barriers between Developers, Operations, and Security and Compliance officers. Development teams take greater ownership of security rather than relying on external teams to evaluate their software for security, often late in the development cycle when discovered vulnerabilities are more disruptive and expensive to remediate. The old model of having a siloed security team does not scale and does not meet the needs of a development project in a cloud-native DevOps domain. With DevSecOps, a security team's purpose evolves to more of a supportive, advising, and governance role.\n\nWith DevSecOps, developers can continue to deliver updates frequently with a minimal amount of friction. Integration of automated security scans and controls into the DevOps pipelines provides confidence with evidence to the change management process. This integration also supports automated approvals of new deployments to production when all secure criteria are met and specific checks pass. Introducing security and compliance early into the development and deployment process reduces costs and risk by identifying problems early before the software reaches a production environment. This approach is often referred to as \"shift-left\".

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API. The core network services that are offered by NSX are:\n\n\n\n Logical switches \n\nA cloud deployment or a virtual data center might have various applications across multiple tenants.

Through the adoption of NSX-T\u2122 as the SDN provider for the workloads, it removes the network and security administration duties from the scope of the virtualization administrator role. NSX-T, unlike NSX for vSphere, is not reliant upon a vCenter to manage the SDN network objects, traffic flows, and security configurations. Divorcing the network control plane from the vCenter means it is no longer possible for the virtualization administrator to view or change anything that impacts the network. The network and security administrators use the NSX-T dedicated management portal to configure the network and the required security policies.\n\nThe edge services region is strictly limited to the protection of the management region and the vSphere components that deliver compute and storage resources to the workload region. The security administrator, who has the responsibility of managing the SDN security, might also serve as the administrator of the gateway VMs that run on the gateway cluster. Or, to isolate a single administrator's scope of influence, the responsibility might be assigned to an administrator who has access only to the edge gateway and no access to manage SDN security.\n\nThe workload region is managed by one or more administrators that are only responsible for the management of the application VMs deployed upon the workload clusters.

These operators allow you to provision and manage File, Block, and Object storage for your containerized workloads in Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on IBM Cloud\u00ae clusters. Unlike other storage solutions where you might need to configure separate drivers and operators for each type of storage, ODF is a unified solution capable of adapting or scaling to your storage needs. You can also deploy ODF on any OCP cluster.\n\nHow does OpenShift Data Foundation work?\n: ODF uses storage volumes in multiples of 3 and replicates your app data across these volumes. The underlying storage volumes that you use for ODF depends on your cluster type. - For VPC clusters the storage volumes are dynamically provisioned Block Storage for VPC devices. - For bare metal Classic clusters, the storage volumes are local disks on your bare metal worker nodes. - For Satellite clusters, the storage volumes are either local disks on your worker nodes, or you can dynamically provision disks by using a compatible block storage driver.\n: ODF uses these devices to create a virtualized storage layer, where your app data is replicated for high availability. Because ODF abstracts your underlying storage, you can use ODF to create File, Block, or Object storage claims from the same underlying raw block storage.\n\nFor a full overview of the features and benefits, see [OpenShift Data Foundation](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation).\n\n\n\n Architecture overview", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ocs-storage-prep"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10170-12206-14575", "score": 17.196399688720703, "text": "\nDevelopers don't need to become experts in cloud security, they can enforce policy driven authentication easily by using IBM Cloud App ID.\n\nWith Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy.

For existing accounts, provisioning scripts are managed within the IBM Cloud\u00ae console. During the ordering process, you can manually enter scripts for new accounts or scripts that are not yet tracked.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a cloud-init enabled image and provide user data to automatically perform configuration tasks or run scripts. For more information, see [Provisioning with a cloud-init enabled image](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/image-templates?topic=image-templates-provisioning-with-a-cloud-init-enabled-image).\n\nDuring the provisioning process, scripts that are associated with an HTTP URL are downloaded to the device. After provisioning, an administrator must run the script manually on the device. Scripts that are associated with an HTTPS URL are downloaded and run automatically. Provisioning scripts are currently available on only Linux operating systems (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Debian, or Ubuntu), and Windows and FreeBSD. The provisioning script can be any type of file that is run by the operating system, including combined binary files or any OS supported language.\n\nFor more information, see [Managing a provisioning script](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-a-provisioning-scriptmanaging-a-provisioning-script).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-provisioning-scripts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10834-3188-5278", "score": 12.506815910339355, "text": "\nWhether you have an app already or plan to develop a script to use, your code probably needs a few tweaks to make it consumable by IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions. The code itself must meet some structural requirements, such as the input parameters and the output results.

Maybe you want code to run on every commit to a GitHub repository. Or maybe you want your code to run every time that an update is made in a Cloudant database.\n\nAfter you choose an event to trigger your function, review the packages that are already available to use.

To organize your functions across these environments, you might choose to create one organization per function. Then, create a space for each environment you need. Instead, you could also have one organization for each environment and create a space per function. No matter how you arrange your organizations and spaces, choose a structure that you can use to effectively manage your function entities.\n\nYou can also use [namespaces](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-namespaces) to isolate resources.

If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP.

Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet.

Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include, for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements.

In this case an interface can be a dataplane interface (dp0s0) or a virtual interface (dp0bond0.303). Each interface has three possible firewall assignments:\n\nin - The firewall is checked against packets entering through the interface. These packets can be traversing or be destined for the VRA.\n\nout - The firewall is checked against packets leaving through the interface. These packets can be traversing or originating on the VRA.\n\nlocal - The firewall is checked against packets which are destined directly for the VRA.\n\nAn interface can have multiple rule sets applied in each direction. They are applied in the order of configuration. Note that it is not possible to firewall traffic originating from the VRA device using per-interface firewalls.\n\nAs an example, to assign the ALLOW_LEGACY rule set to the in option for the bp0s1 interface, you would use the configuration command:\n\nset interfaces dataplane dp0s1 firewall in ALLOW_LEGACY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Control Plane Policing (CPP) \n\nControl plane policing (CPP) provides protection against attacks on the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Router Appliance by allowing you to configure firewall policies that are assigned to desired interfaces and applying these policies to packets entering the VRA.\n\nCPP is implemented when the local keyword is used in firewall policies that are assigned to any type of VRA interface, such as data plane interfaces or loopback. Unlike the firewall rules applied for packets traversing through the VRA, the default action of firewall rules for traffic entering or leaving the control plane is Allow. Users must add explicit drop rules if the default behavior is not desired.\n\nThe VRA provides a basic CPP rule set as template. You can merge it into your configuration by running:\n\nvyatta@vrouter merge /opt/vyatta/etc/cpp.conf", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-manage-your-ibm-firewalls"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13915-3198-5235", "score": 17.67108917236328, "text": "\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 1 action drop\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 1 source address network-group1\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 action drop\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 destination port 23\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 log\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 protocol tcp\nset security firewall name ALLOW_LEGACY rule 2 source address network-group2\n\nIn the ruleset, ALLOW_LEGACY, there are two rules defined.

The default-action indicates that anything else is accepted.\n\n\n\n\n\n Allowing data center access \n\nIBM\u00a9 offers several IP subnets to provide services and support to systems running within the data center.

You can find the IP ranges used in the data centers in [this topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).\n\nYou can allow data center access by placing the proper SERVICE-ALLOW rules at the beginning of the firewall rule sets with an action of accept. Where the rule set must be applied depends on the routing and firewall design being implemented.\n\nIt is recommended that you place the firewall rules in the location which causes the least duplication of work. For example, allowing backend subnets inbound on dp0bond0 would be less work than allowing backend subnets outbound toward each VLAN virtual interface.\n\n\n\n Per-interface firewall rules \n\nOne method for configuring the firewall on a VRA is to apply firewall rule sets to each interface.

It is recommend that you modify this rule set to suit your environment.\n\nPlease note that CPP rules cannot be stateful, and will only apply on ingress traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zone firewalling \n\nAnother firewall concept within the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Router Appliance is zone based firewalls. In zone-based firewall operation an interface is assigned to a zone (only one zone per interface) and firewall rule sets are assigned to the boundaries between zones with the idea that all interfaces within a zone have the same security level and are allowed to route freely. Traffic is only scrutinized when it is passing from one zone to another. Zones drop any traffic coming into them which is not explicitly allowed.\n\nAn interface can either belong to a zone or have a per-interface firewall configuration; an interface cannot do both.\n\nImagine the following office scenario with three departments, each department with its own VLAN:\n\n\n\n* Department A - VLANs 10 and 20 (interface dp0bond1.10 and dp0bond1.20)\n* Department B - VLANs 30 and 40 (interface dp0bond1.30 and dp0bond1.40)\n* Department C - VLAN 50 (interface dp0bond1.50)\n\n\n\nA zone can be created for each department and the interfaces for that department can be added to the zone.

Allow rules require you to decide what software needs access to instance metadata. By defining rules, you can prevent software from accidentally accessing the metadata service if you later change the software or configuration on the instance.\n\nYou can also define group usage of the allow rules. Add and remove users from a permitted group without changing the firewall rule.\n\nThe following example prevents access to the instance metadata service by all processes, except for processes that are running in the user account trustworthy-user:\n\nsudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner trustworthy-user --jump REJECT\n\n\n\n\n\n Limit trusted profiles for compute resource identities \n\nLimit trusted profiles that you create for compute resource identities.

These scenarios are not because of some vulnerabilities but are a deviation from the compliance posture.

Issues coming from CD pipeline have a different grouping criteria, where the combination of the evidence type id, target environment, and the pipeline namespace is used to construct the title of the issue.

When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

You can use this solution to rapidly create, migrate, and use your virtual machines (VMs) in the Cloud.\n* What are my options to use resources with VMware Shared?\n\nYou are provided with the following two consumption models:\n\n\n\n* On-demand. With this consumption model, you pay only for the compute resources that you use, in an hourly pricing model.\n* Reserved. With this consumption model, you can reserve compute resources in advance to ensure that your capacity is available when you need it. Billing for Reserved is available monthly, yearly, or on a multi-year basis. Other resources, such as storage and egress, are billed per usage, regardless of the consumption model.\n\n\n\n* Why do I want to subscribe to VMware Shared?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03367-2935-4844", "score": 9.485160827636719, "text": "\nprivate.sip_request_uri string The SIP request URI that started the conversation session. \n private.sip_to_uri string The SIP To URI associated with the conversation session. \n private.user_phone_number string The phone number that the call was received from. \n assistant_phone_number string The phone number associated with the Watson Assistant side that received the phone call. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Input parameters that are set by the phone channel \n\nThe following input parameters are only valid for the current conversation turn.\n\n\n\nInput parameters set by the phone channel\n\n Name Type Description \n\n post_response_timeout_occurred boolean Whether the post response timeout expired. \n barge_in_occurred boolean Whether barge-in occurred. \n final_utterance_timeout_occurred true or false Whether the final utterance timeout expired. \n dtmf_collection_succeeded boolean Whether the DTMF collection succeeded or failed.

This allows you to control what prefixes are learned by the transit gateway and is advantageous if you have dozens of on-premises prefixes, but only want the VPC connection to be able to talk to one prefix (or a select few).\n\nThe prefix filter only filters prefixes into the transit gateway.

For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03353-5263-7331", "score": 16.46062469482422, "text": "\nItalian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English. All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing a skill language \n\nOnce a skill has been created, its language cannot be modified. If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1. From your skill tile, click the Actions drop-down menu, and then select Language Preferences.\n\nThis option is only available for skills that are configured to use a bidirectional language.\n2.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-1659-3917", "score": 14.799829483032227, "text": "\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website.

Being able to save an in-progress skill at a specific point in time is especially useful as you start to fine tune your assistant. You often need to make a change and see the impact of the change in real time before you can determine whether or not the change improves or lessens the effectiveness of the assistant. Based on your findings from a test environment deployment, you can make an informed decision about whether to deploy a given change to an assistant that is deployed in a production environment.\n\nTo learn more about how versions can improve the workflow you use to build an assistant, [read this blog post](https://medium.com/ibm-watson/watson-assistant-versions-announcement-d60869b1f5f).\n\n\n\n Creating a version \n\nYou can edit only one version of the dialog skill at a time. The in-progress version is called the development version.\n\nWhen you save a version, any skill settings that you applied to the development version are saved also.\n\nTo create a dialog skill version, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the header of the skill, click Save new version, and then describe the current state of the skill.\n\nAdding a good description will help you to distinguish multiple versions from one another later.\n2. Click Save.\n\n\n\nA snapshot is taken of the current skill and saved as a new version. You remain in the development version of the skill.

This limit change was later reversed. If you created a Standard plan instance during the time frame in which the limit was in effect, your dialogs might be impacted.

Note: The maximum size permitted is 99MB.\n* Max message count Set this value to the maximum number of transactions that can be included in a single block.\n* Preferred max bytes Set this value to the ideal block size in bytes, but it must be less than Absolute max bytes. A minimum transaction size, one that contains no endorsements, is around 1KB. If you add 1KB per required endorsement, a typical transaction size is approximately 3-4KB. Therefore, it is recommended to set the value of Preferred max bytes to be around Max message count * expected averaged tx size. At run time, whenever possible, blocks will not exceed this size.

You can take up to [750 backups of a volume](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about&interface=uisnapshots_vpc_considerations).\n\nYou can [restore](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about&interface=uibackup-service-restore-concepts) data from a backup snapshot to a new, fully provisioned volume. If the backup is of a boot volume, you can use it to provision a new instance. However, when you provision an instance by restoring a boot volume from a bootable backup snapshot, you can expect degraded performance in the beginning. During the restoration process, the data is copied from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC, and thus the provisioned IOPS cannot be fully realized until that process finishes.\n\nYou can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region, and later use that snapshot to restore a volume in the new region.

In the console, backups appear in the list of Block Storage for VPC snapshots. Backups are identified by how they were created, in this case, by backup policy. These terms are used interchangeably in the Documentation, depending on the context.\n\nThe snapshots service is used to create backups, similarities and differences exist between backups and snapshots. Table 1 compares backups to snapshots.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

In VPC storage, your data is protected against drive failures and numerous type of disk errors that otherwise might negatively impact data durability and data integrity. The data is stored redundantly across multiple physical disks in an Availability Zone to prevent data loss due to failure of any single component.\n\nOther than physical failure, a common source of data loss is accidental deletion or modifications of files by users. Block Storage for VPC, Snapshots for VPC, and File Storage for VPC are only accessible to authorized hosts within your virtual private network. You control who can access it. For more information, see [Managing security and compliance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-manage-security-compliance).\n\nAnother measure to protect against accidental deletion and modification of files is a snapshot. If a user accidentally modifies or deletes crucial data from a volume, the data can be easily and quickly restored from a snapshot or a backup. For more information about this feature, see [About Snapshots for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about).\n\nThe 11 nines durability target applies to a single Availability Zone.

Application-level encryption can be implemented by including a database proxy that intercepts and encrypts sensitive data in accordance with the pre-established data protection policy.\n\nData Security Broker encryption has some restrictions, like any other approaches to the application-level encryption implementation. The various aspects of the application level encryption limitations are explained below:\n\nPerformance hit Data encryption consumes more time and resources than data decryption. This overhead is normally negligible. If the proxy (Shield) has an appropriately sized CPU and Memory, there should not be any noticeable performance penalties. Most users experience a 10--20% reduction in the overall application performance. This can be mitigated by horizontal scaling. In the event of failure, Shield can be horizontally scaled by adding more of them behind a load balancer.\n\nKey management You must have a place to store your secret key or key file. You can use IBM Key Protect. IBM Key Protect provides full encryption visibility and control, allowing you to see and manage data encryption and the entire key lifecycle from a single location. Alternatively, you can secure the information with a password, but this reduces security, depending on the level of your password's strength.\n\nAccessibility If your key file is lost, your data is also lost. So, make a backup of your data and your key.\n\nDatabase operations carried out on encrypted versions of the data The information is kept in encrypted form in the database and the database engine and, consequently, the database administrator is never permitted to see the information in form of the plaintext.\n\nMany of today's server and network technologies allow for easier configuration and implementation to minimize the impact on utilization. Implementing encryption of data in transit from endpoint to endpoint both remotely and internally is mandatory in today's cyber risk environment.\n\nThe following are considered equality check operators and are supported:\n\n\n\n* =\n* <>\n* IS NULL\n* IS NOT NULL\n* IN\n* NOT\n* JOIN (all types)\n* GROUP BY", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_limitations"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09081-1687-4004", "score": 16.968992233276367, "text": "\nData encryption keys (DEKs) are designed to encrypt your data and can be generated and managed by your service or an IBM Cloud service.\n\nEnvelope encryption offers several benefits for protecting your data:\n\n\n\n* Protection under a combination of multiple algorithms Envelope encryption uses the best benefits from symmetric and public key algorithms to keep your keys secure.\n\n\n\n1. Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

This is performed using Data Security Broker Manager to enumerate the data schema and enable an encryption key mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Tokenization: \n\nData Security Broker supports length preserving and data type preserving tokenization method to anonymize data at the field level databases or in semi-structured data files.\n\n\n\n\n\n Record Level Encryption: \n\nData Security Broker can be configured for record level encryption to support multiple keys within a single column that are mapped to respective data owners or entities. This encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Masking: \n\nData Security Broker can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration to external parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Deployment Plans in IBM Cloud Data Data Security Broker: \n\nWhen you assign and customize default Data Protection Policies with Data Security Broker Manager, there are three options that you can choose to implement your data encryption policy:\n\n\n\n Save Policy: \n\nSave Policy option is selected by default. This option saves your selected data, but does not execute encryption or data protection on your database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new policy is saved to overwrite it.

Data Security Broker provides easy and feasible way to provide enhanced data protection for sensitive data in public or private cloud environments. The software includes dynamic management of customer-owned keys and the ability to protect databases at a column-level granularity.\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nData Security Broker delivers an enterprise-level transparent data security platform that secures databases through a \"no code\" model at the field or file level.

The Shield is used to intercept SQL or its NoSQL equivalent generated by the application to access data records in the database by encrypting on writes and decrypting on reads.\n\nThe encryption process manages keys that are generated by a commercially available key management service such as IBM\u00ae Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services.\n\nApplication performance is minimally impacted allowing for enterprise workflows to continue to operate in a secure environment. The Data Security Broker Manager is the cloud-based management console providing scalability, fault tolerance, and manageability of the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n Encryption Technology Configuration Overview: \n\nData Security Broker supports data protection services that can be configured in four main modes.\n\n\n\n Data Encryption:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-broker?topic=security-broker-sb_about"}]}

The implicit equality test also applies for fields and subfields.\n\nAny JSON object that isn't the argument to a condition operator is an implicit $and operator on each field.\n\nSee the following example selector that uses an operator to match any document, where the year field has a value greater than 2010:\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"year\": {\n\"$gt\": 2010\n}\n}\n}\n\nIn the following example, a matching document must have a field that is called director, and the field must have a value exactly equal to Lars von Trier.\n\nSee the following example of the implicit equality operator:\n\n{\n\"director\": \"Lars von Trier\"\n}\n\nYou can also make the equality operator explicit, as shown in the following example.\n\nSee the following example of an explicit equality operator:\n\n{\n\"director\": {\n\"$eq\": \"Lars von Trier\"\n}\n}\n\nIn the following example that uses subfields, the field imdb in a matching document must also have a subfield rating, and the subfield must have a value equal to 8.\n\nSee the following example of implicit operator that is applied to a subfield test:\n\n{\n\"imdb\": {\n\"rating\": 8\n}\n}", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-7918-10060", "score": 11.88555908203125, "text": "\nYour database's schema can evolve over time to match your application's needs. You don't (necessarily) need to tell the database about the schema change - write new documents in the new format.\n\nWe can even store multiple document \"types\" in the same database. In this case, people, books, and places reside in the same database. We know which is which because of the \"type\" field (this field is a convention and not something that means anything to IBM Cloudant).\n\nAn alternative to this configuration is to have three databases people, books, and places and keep each data type in its own database. Both approaches are fine. You can choose to have multiple types together in the same database if you need to perform queries across types or if you need to replicate all data types together. Otherwise, the separate databases approach might be better.\n\nTo summarize, although IBM Cloudant is \"schemaless\", this fact doesn't absolve you of the need to do detailed data design to get the best performance.\n\nThese tips are especially relevant if you have some relational database experience.\n\n\n\n* Avoid thinking in joins - an IBM Cloudant document must contain everything that you need about that object so that it can be retrieved in one API call.\n* Normalization goes out of the window in JSON store, some repeated values can be tolerated if it makes data retrieval more efficient.\n* Although we have a 1 MB limit on document size, your documents must be much smaller - a few KB is typical.\n* If your application can embrace a \"write only\"* design pattern, where data is only ever added to a database, then it can make your life easier.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models.

You can invite IBM Cloud users to your account and leverage IAM access groups to streamline the access assignment process in your organization. As a multi-tenant solution, Schematics creates all resources in your personal account. Resources are not shared or reused by other IBM Cloud tenants. Because Schematics is built on Kubernetes, IAM service access roles are mapped to role-based access controls (RBAC) in Kubernetes to enforce resource isolation within your account. \n Full IBM support for the open-source tools and plug-ins related to IBM Cloud Schematics is fully integrated into the IBM Cloud support system. If you run into an issue by using the IBM Cloud Provider Plug-in for Terraform or the Ansible modules for IBM Cloud, you can [open an IBM Cloud support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatargetting-support).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-learn-about-schematics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10170-8677-11078", "score": 8.763050079345703, "text": "\n* Microservices greatly reduce time to delivery for patches, bug fixes, and new features.

A rotation policy automatically rotates your keys based on a schedule; manual rotation rotates keys on demand.\n\nIf you're using Hyper Protect Crypto Services, you can also rotate master keys by using [IBM Cloud TKE CLI plug-in](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-rotate-master-key-cli). Information in the following sections pertains to rotating root keys only.\n\nYou can set a [rotation policy](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-set-rotation-policy) for a KMS-generated root key and define a rotation schedule to automatically rotate your key. In your KMS instance, you can set a rotation interval in the range of 1 - 12 months.\n\nYou can also manually rotate your imported or KMS-generated root keys at any time. Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services allow one rotation per hour for each root key. The KMS replaces the key immediately upon your request. Use this option when you import a new root key to the KMS instance and want to rotate the key immediately.\n\nFor more information about these options, see [Comparing your key rotation options in Key Protect](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-key-rotationcompare-key-rotation-options).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-key-rotation"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09081-1687-4004", "score": 8.442809104919434, "text": "\nData encryption keys (DEKs) are designed to encrypt your data and can be generated and managed by your service or an IBM Cloud service.\n\nEnvelope encryption offers several benefits for protecting your data:\n\n\n\n* Protection under a combination of multiple algorithms Envelope encryption uses the best benefits from symmetric and public key algorithms to keep your keys secure.\n\n\n\n1. Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them.

The response might be the answer to a question such as Where can I get some gas? or the execution of a command, such as turning on the radio. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree.

Before you start to create indexes, first configure the default location, called base location, for indexes created in your Data Engine instance. When you use Hive tables, you can also configure the index location per Hive table.\n\nTo assign your base location, use the following command:\n\nALTER METAINDEX SET LOCATION <path>\n\nThe following command includes a path:\n\nALTER METAINDEX SET LOCATION cos://us-south/mybucket/mypath/\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating data skipping indexes \n\nWhen you create a data skipping index on a data set, decide which columns to index, and choose an index type for each column. Your choices depend on your workload and data. In general, index those columns that are queried the most in the WHERE clause. The three supported index types are MinMax, ValueList, and BloomFilter.\n\nThe following example creates a data skipping index on the metergen data set that uses three index types:\n\nCREATE METAINDEX\nMINMAX FOR temp,\nMINMAX FOR lat,\nMINMAX FOR lng,\nBLOOMFILTER FOR vid,\nVALUELIST FOR city\nON cos://us-geo/sql/metergen STORED AS parquet\n\nIn the [Cloud Object Storage URI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceCOSURI), specify the top level (the root) of the data set.\n\nIt is possible to share indexes across Data Engine accounts. Users who have READ access to the base location of an index can use it by setting their base location. However, it is important to avoid multiple users who write indexes for the same data set to the same base location. Users can avoid sharing indexes by using different base locations.\n\nData Engine charges for index creation based on the amount of data scanned.

The SDK SHOULD support synchronous or pseudo-synchronous (e.g. async/await) invocation of methods that perform network operation in languages where this method style is idiomatic.\n\n\n\n\n\n Instrumentation \n\nThe SDK SHOULD be instrumented so that relevant usage data can be collected by the service.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sdk-handbook?topic=sdk-handbook-content"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10817-6582-8092", "score": 12.352285385131836, "text": "\n} else {\nvar result = reply[\"result\"]\nprint(\"Got result (result)\")\n}\n})\n} catch {\nprint(\"Error (error)\")\n}\n\nBy default, the SDK returns only the activation ID and any result that is produced by the invoked action. To get metadata of the entire response object, which includes the HTTP response status code, use the following setting:\n\nwhisk.verboseReplies = true\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the mobile SDK \n\nYou can configure the SDK to work with different installations of Cloud Functions by using the baseURL parameter. For instance:\n\nwhisk.baseURL = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n\nIn this example, you use an installation that is running at http://localhost:8080. If you do not specify the baseURL, the mobile SDK uses the instance that is running at [https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com](https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com).\n\nYou can pass in a custom NSURLSession in case you require special network handling. For example, you might have your own Cloud Functions installation that uses self-signed certificates:\n\n// create a network delegate that trusts everything\nclass NetworkUtilsDelegate: NSObject, NSURLSessionDelegate {\nfunc URLSession(session: NSURLSession, didReceiveChallenge challenge: NSURLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: (NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition, NSURLCredential?) -> Void) {\ncompletionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition.UseCredential, NSURLCredential(forTrust: challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust!))\n}\n}\n// create an NSURLSession that uses the trusting delegate", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdk"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13429-166159-168045", "score": 12.159703254699707, "text": "\nNew UK English and Arabic models\n: The service supports more languages with its transcription models: en-UK_BroadbandModel and en-UK_NarrowbandModel for UK English, and ar-AR_BroadbandModel for Modern Standard Arabic.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install.

This status code means that the image doesn't exist in your account.

Depending on whether recovery crypto units are assigned to your instance, the plug-in provides two ways for instance initialization: by using recovery crypto units and by using key part files.\n\nOperational crypto unit\n: Each service instance is composed of multiple operational crypto units. The operational crypto units are located in different availability zones of the same region for high availability. They are used to manage encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations. The number of crypto units that you specify when you create your instance is the number of operational crypto units.\n\nRecovery crypto unit\n: The purpose of recovery crypto units is to generate a random master key value and to save a backup copy of the master key value. You can use recovery crypto units to load the master key and restore the master key when it is destroyed or lost.\n\nCurrently, recovery crypto units are enabled only in the region of Dallas (us-south) and Washington DC (us-east). If you create your instance in either of the two regions, two recovery crypto units are automatically assigned to your instance without extra costs: one is in the us-south; the other is in the us-east.\n\nIf smart cards are used to load the master key, the recovery crypto units are not applicable and can be ignored. The backup of the master key relies on the backup of the smart cards in that case.\n\nFailover crypto unit\n: Failover crypto units back up the operational crypto units in another region, which includes keystores that store encryption keys. When a regional disaster occurs, you can use failover crypto units to ensure production workloads and avoid data loss.\n\nCurrently, failover crypto units are available only in the region of Dallas (us-south) and Washington DC (us-east). If you create your instance in either of the two regions, you can choose whether to enable the failover crypto units with [extra charges](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricing).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-architecture-workload-isolation"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07578-807740-809746", "score": 9.064144134521484, "text": "\nBilling stops after (1) you request a circuit to be deleted, and (2) the provider has de-provisioned the circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n What extra charges will I incur from other parties with Direct Link? \n\nYou might have extra charges from your provider.

This scheduler places all I/O requests into a FIFO (First in, First Out) queue. It's a useful tool for checking whether complex I/O scheduling decisions of other schedulers are causing I/O performance regressions. This scheduler is recommended for setups with devices that do I/O scheduling themselves, such as intelligent storage or in multipathing environments. If you choose a more complicated scheduler on the host, the scheduler of the host and the scheduler of the storage device can compete with each other and decrease performance. The storage device can usually determine best how to schedule I/O. For more information about how to check and configure the I/O scheduler, see Red Hat's [How to use the NOOP or None IO Schedulers](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/109223).\n* Completely fair queuing (CFQ) uses both elevators and request merging, and it's a bit more complex than the NOOP or deadline schedulers. It's the standard scheduler for many Linux distributions. It groups simultaneous requests that are made by operations into a series of per-process pools before it allocates time slices to use the disc for every queue.\n\n\n\nIf your work load is dominated by interactive applications, the users might complain of sluggish performance of databases with many I/O operations. In such environments, read operations happen significantly more often than write operations, and applications are more likely to be waiting to read data.

The best path to origin must be known at the time a user\u2019s request arrives at an Edge server because any inline analysis or detection would defeat the purpose of speeding up things.\n\nTo accomplish this, you are asked to place a test object on your origin. Edge servers periodically fetch the test object from the origin using each of the candidate paths, including the direct path (the default path through the internet from Edge to Origin).\n\nThe fetches of the test object are called the races. When a real request comes in, the Edge consults the most recent race data to send that request over the fastest path to the origin. You can download the provided [test object](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/cloud/bluemix/network/cdn/route-detection-test-object.html) and upload it to the origin server, or you can use your own test object.\n\nA valid test object must:\n\n\n\n* Get HTTP 200 response without authentication\n* Not contact a database or do any back-end processing\n* Be a static text file of content-type text/HTML\n* Be approximately the size of an average page, but no less than 8 KB\n\n\n\nDetection path is designed to work only for HTTPS domain mapping (SAN HTTPS or Wildcard HTTPS).\n\n\n\n\n\n Prefetching \n\nPrefetching is to inspect HTML responses and prefetch embedded objects in the HTML files.

Your assistant can automatically help customers recover from many such situations, and you can configure how it responds.\n\n\n\n How error conditions are handled \n\nThere are several kinds of error situations your assistant might need to recover from:\n\n\n\n* Your assistant cannot understand your customer's request\n* Your customer does not provide a valid response to a question\n* Your customer asks to talk to a live agent\n\n\n\nYour assistant can detect error conditions and give customers the chance to correct them. In addition, the built-in Fallback action provides a way to automatically connect customers to a live agent if they need more help.\n\n\n\n When the assistant can't understand your customer's request \n\nWhen you build actions, you train your assistant on what your customers might ask for. The Customer starts with section of each action provides examples of customer input that trigger the action; the assistant uses natural language processing to recognize customer input that is similar to these examples. This happens at the beginning of the conversation, or after any action has completed and the assistant is ready for another action.\n\nBut you can't anticipate every possible request, so sometimes customers will send input that your assistant can't match to any action. This might happen because the input isn't phrased in a way that the assistant can understand; it can also happen if customers ask for things that your assistant isn't designed to handle.\n\nUnrecognized input of this sort triggers the built-in No action matches action.

Even after the Schematics web console shows that the cluster is successfully provisioned, there are still some tasks that run in the background for several minutes. Allow a few minutes (typically 2 minutes is sufficient) after the cluster gets provisioned for egosh to be available.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why does cluster creation using dedicated hosts fail sometimes with the error status of dedicated host is failed? \n\nIn some regions, dedicated hosts have a limitation on the number of virtual server instances that can be placed on them at one time. You can try to provision the cluster with a smaller number of virtual server instances to overcome this.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why does Spectrum Scale not allow use of the default value of 0.0.0.0/0 for security group creation? \n\nFor security reasons, Spectrum Scale does not allow you to provide a default value that would allow network traffice from any external device.

In addition, Spectrum Symphony has a feature where each node of the cluster can be accessed through passwordless SSH.\n\n\n\n\n\n What storage types are available through this offering? \n\nIn the Spectrum Symphony offering, you can use Spectrum Scale scratch storage or persistent storage. A scratch storage configuration uses virtual server instances with instance storage. A persistent storage configuration uses bare metal servers with locally attached NVMe storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n Which Linux operating system is supported for worker nodes?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hpc-spectrum-symphony?topic=hpc-spectrum-symphony-spectrum-symphony-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_08391-4563-6492", "score": 7.743008613586426, "text": "\nSchematics isn't able to provision the cluster, and you are seeing the following example error message:\n\n\"code\": \"validation_unique_failed\",\n\"message\": \"Provided Name (sample-symphony-vpc) is not unique\",\n\"target\": {\n\"name\": \"name\",\n\"type\": \"field\",\n\"value\": \"sample-symphony-vpc\"\n}\n\n Why it\u2019s happening \n\nVPC resource names must be unique.

A VPC subnet consists of a specified private IP address range (CIDR block) and configures a group of worker nodes and pods as if they were attached to the same physical wire. VPC subnets are dedicated to your IBM Cloud account and not shared across IBM customers.\n\nVPC subnets provide a channel for connectivity among the worker nodes within the cluster. Any system that is connected to any of the private subnets in the same VPC can communicate with workers. For example, all subnets in one VPC can communicate through private layer 3 routing with a built-in VPC router. If your clusters don't need to communicate, you can achieve the best network segmentation by creating the clusters in separate VPCs. If you have multiple clusters that must communicate with each other, you can create the clusters in the same VPC. Although subnets within one VPC can be shared by multiple clusters in that VPC, you can achieve better network segmentation by using different subnets for clusters within one VPC.\n\nTo achieve further private network segmentation between VPC subnets for your account, you can set up custom network policies with VPC access control lists (ACLs). When you create a VPC, a default ACL is created in the format allow-all-network-acl-<VPC_ID> for the VPC. Any subnet that you create in the VPC is attached to this ACL by default. The ACL includes an inbound rule and an outbound rule that allow all traffic between your worker nodes on a subnet and any system on the subnets in the same VPC.

With VPEs, you can connect to supported IBM Cloud services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC.\n\nVPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to IBM Cloud services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10916-47417-49519", "score": 3.8668808937072754, "text": "\nAn IBM Business Partner that provides IT services on a contractual basis to maintain clients' computers, networks or software.

If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise.

Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.

This separation means that users who manage your enterprise can't access account resources within the child accounts unless you specifically enable them to. For example, your financial officer can have the Administrator role on the Billing account management service within the enterprise account, which provides them access to billing and payment information and usage data down to the resource type.

Immutable Object Storage preserves electronic records and maintains data integrity. Retention policies ensure that data is stored in a Write-One-Read-Many (WORM), non-erasable, and non-rewritable manner. You cannot change or delete objects in protected buckets within the retention period, or delete protected buckets with objects themselves until the retention period is over. The policy is enforced until the end of a retention period and the removal of any legal holds.\n\nIt is recommended that teams set a retention policy for the buckets that are used as their evidence locker that stores every object for a minimum of 365 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Audit event log", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-cd-devsecops-cos-bucket-evidence"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04862-7-1848", "score": 13.858057022094727, "text": "\nUsing Aspera high-speed transfer \n\nAspera high-speed transfer overcomes the limitations of traditional FTP and HTTP transfers to improve data transfer performance under most conditions, especially in networks with high latency and packet loss.\n\nThis feature is not currently supported in Object Storage for Satellite.

For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support).

Your assistant can automatically help customers recover from many such situations, and you can configure how it responds.\n\n\n\n How error conditions are handled \n\nThere are several kinds of error situations your assistant might need to recover from:\n\n\n\n* Your assistant cannot understand your customer's request\n* Your customer does not provide a valid response to a question\n* Your customer asks to talk to a live agent\n\n\n\nYour assistant can detect error conditions and give customers the chance to correct them. In addition, the built-in Fallback action provides a way to automatically connect customers to a live agent if they need more help.\n\n\n\n When the assistant can't understand your customer's request \n\nWhen you build actions, you train your assistant on what your customers might ask for. The Customer starts with section of each action provides examples of customer input that trigger the action; the assistant uses natural language processing to recognize customer input that is similar to these examples. This happens at the beginning of the conversation, or after any action has completed and the assistant is ready for another action.\n\nBut you can't anticipate every possible request, so sometimes customers will send input that your assistant can't match to any action. This might happen because the input isn't phrased in a way that the assistant can understand; it can also happen if customers ask for things that your assistant isn't designed to handle.\n\nUnrecognized input of this sort triggers the built-in No action matches action.

The context is an object that is passed back and forth between your application and the assistant, storing information that can be preserved and updated as the conversation goes on. Because we are using the stateless message method, the assistant does not store the context, so it is the responsibility of our client application to maintain it from one turn of the conversation to the next.\n\nThe context includes a session ID for each conversation, as well as a counter that is incremented with each turn of the conversation. The assistant updates the context and returns it with each response. But our previous version of the example did not preserve the context, so these updates were lost, and each round of input appeared to be the start of a new conversation. We can fix that by saving the context and sending it back to the assistant each time.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-api-client"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09755-1450-3171", "score": 7.682839870452881, "text": "\nThe Stack Overflow forum, for technical questions, and the IBM Developer Answers forum, for general questions, both provide a wide variety of searchable answers to your IBM Cloud questions.\n\nIf you don't find an existing answer to a question, ask a new one.\n\nYou can access Stack Overflow and IBM Developer Answers from the Support Center, or use the following links:\n\n\n\n* Go to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud) to ask technical questions about the IBM Cloud Monitoring service.\n* Go to [IBM Developer Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/ibm-cloud/) to ask general questions about the IBM Cloud Monitoring service and about getting started instructions.\n\n\n\nTag your questions with ibm-cloud and monitoring.\n\nIBM Cloud development and support teams actively monitor Stack Overflow and IBM Developer Answers, and follow the questions that are tagged with ibm-cloud.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 15.978620529174805, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 12.955693244934082, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires.

As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default.

By using the cache more effectively, you'll increase performance because you'll revalidate less often.\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I tell if items are being cached? \n\nCIS adds the response header CF-Cache-Status when it attempts to cache an object. If caching is successful, the value of this header indicates its status with one of these keywords:\n\n\n\n* MISS: The asset was not yet in the cache or the TTL had expired (that is, it had reached the cache-control maximum age of 0).\n* HIT: The asset was delivered from the cache.\n* EXPIRED: This asset was delivered from cache, but the next request requires revalidation.\n* REVALIDATED: The asset was delivered from cache. The TTL was expired, but an If-Modified-Since request to the origin indicated that the asset had not changed.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09410-1574-3779", "score": 22.696155548095703, "text": "\n* IBM Cloud Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM.\n* The IBM Cloud Container Registry includes Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

Review the [image and registry security topic](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-securityimages_registry) for steps that you can take to ensure secure container images. For example, you might use Vulnerability Advisor to check the security status of container images.

Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified. This verdict can be used by Portieris to prevent the deployment of nonsecure images in Container Registry. [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris) is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nSee the following for more information on Container Registry and how to set it up:\n\n\n\n* [About Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-development-processes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10439-40150-42016", "score": 20.78929328918457, "text": "\nAs you plan how many Service objects you need in your cluster, keep in mind that Kubernetes uses iptables to handle networking and port forwarding rules.

It is expected to grow and evolve over time in order to best address the needs and requirements of users and developers of IBM Cloud APIs. To learn how to get involved, see [Contributing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-contributing).\n\n\n\n  Using this handbook \n\nThis handbook is intended to be used by IBM Cloud service architects and developers as guidelines for designing any REST API exposed publicly by IBM Cloud services. Private or internal APIs SHOULD also follow these guidelines for providing the same level of consistency to internal service consumers and simplify the process if the internal APIs are subsequently exposed publicly.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons for a service to be exempted from adhering to this handbook's guidelines. For example, an exemption may be approved if a service offers an API compatible with a de facto standard, such as S3, or if a service offers an API that seamlessly extends an open source project, such as Kubernetes, following that project's API standards and conventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Conventions used \n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Verifying compliance \n\nThe [OpenAPI Validator tool](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-validator) validates OpenAPI documents against a subset of the standards defined in this handbook and identifies areas of non-compliance with the OpenAPI specification or the guidelines in this handbook.\n\nThe output of the OpenAPI Validator is a report that identifies specific elements of the API definition that fail to comply with the OpenAPI specification or the IBM API Handbook. All errors listed by the report MUST be resolved prior to publication of the API unless the remediations would result in breaking changes for an existing API version.\n\nResolving all issues reported by the validator does not guarantee full compliance with this handbook's standards. API designers MUST perform further manual validations for the guidelines that cannot be checked automatically by the tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-intro"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05724-5473-7562", "score": 20.46200942993164, "text": "\n* IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service\n* IBM Cloudant\n* IBM\u00ae Secure Gateway for IBM Cloud\u00ae\n* App ID\n\n\n\nFor sensitive workloads, the clusters can be hosted in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service for Bare Metal. By using industry-standard containers technology, apps can initially be re-hosted on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service quickly without major architectural changes. This change provides the immediate benefit of scalability.\n\nThey can replicate and scale the apps by using defined rules and the automated Kubernetes orchestrator. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides scalable compute resources and the associated DevOps dashboards to create, scale, and tear down apps and services. By using Kubernetes's deployment and runtime objects, the provider can monitor and manage upgrades to apps reliably.\n\nIBM\u00ae Secure Gateway for IBM Cloud\u00ae is used to create a secure pipeline to on-premises databases and documents for apps that are re-hosted to run in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a modern NoSQL database suitable a range of data-driven use cases from key-value to complex document-oriented data storage and query. To minimize queries to the back-office RDBMS, IBM Cloudant is used to cache the user's session data across apps. These choices improve the front-end app usability and performance across the apps on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\n\nMoving compute workloads into the IBM Cloud isn't enough though. The provider needs to go through a methods transformation as well. By adopting the practices of the IBM Garage Method, the provider can implement an agile and iterative delivery process that supports modern DevOps practices like CI/CD.\n\nMuch of the CI/CD process itself is automated with IBM's Continuous Delivery service in the Cloud. The provider can define workflow toolchains to prepare container images, check for vulnerabilities, and deploy them to the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Results \n\n\n\n* Lifting the existing monolithic VMs into cloud-hosted containers was a first step that allowed the provider to save on capital costs and begin learning modern DevOps practices.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_uc_health"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16727-143758-145711", "score": 20.30915641784668, "text": "\nIt is recommend that you take advantage of the IBM Log Analysis service that allows you to easily parse the logs in real time.\n* Is there a best practice for monitoring my blockchain resources?\n\nYou are responsible for the health monitoring and resource allocation of the blockchain nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.

For example, IBM manages and automatically applies updates to your cluster master. For your worker nodes, IBM provides security and version updates, but you must apply the updates.

For example, some recommendations might be more in-depth configuration requirements than your particular processes or standards require. Also, some recommendations are not scored, and don't impact the overall benchmark score.\n\nNext, decide whether the component falls within your responsibility. If so, you might need to change how you configure that component. For example, you might configure pod security policies for all your app deployments.

For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more. For the full list of aggregation options, see the [Aggregations table](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-aggregations).

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues.

The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs.

A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call.

User tags can also help you with identifying specific team usage or cost allocation. By creating access management tags, you can control access to your resources and service IDs without requiring updates to your IAM policies.\n\n\n\n Tagging rules \n\nTags are not case-sensitive, and the maximum length of a tag is 128 characters. The permitted characters are A-Z, 0-9, spaces, underscore, hyphen, period, and colon. The only supported format for access management tags is key:value. The use of a colon formats the tag into a string that isolates two logical parts, like a env:dev pair. A comma separates multiple tags and can't be used within the tag name itself.\n\nTags are visible account-wide and can be replicated across geographic regions. Since tags are not regulated information, avoid creating tags that use personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, or other identifying or proprietary information.\n\n\n\n Sample tags and syntax \n\nYou can apply tags to help you organize and manage your resources, service IDs, and access policies. Consider writing tags as key:value pairs to help coordinate your development environments, projects, compliance, and optimization throughout your organization.

As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for IBM Cloud billing and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does billing work in IBM Cloud? \n\nIBM Cloud has two billable account types, Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. With a billable account, you can use IBM Cloud resources and services that incur costs. The account type that you choose impacts how you're billed for your resource usage.\n\nWhen you have a Pay-As-You-Go account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. You pay only for what you use, with no long-term contracts. As your resource usage changes, so does your invoice, similar to a utility bill. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads.\n\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02625-0-1752", "score": 9.43716812133789, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Reviewing your plan and usage \n\nYou can review information about your API Connect Reserved plan and API use.

But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry or the [internal registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/registry/index.html) that is automatically set up in your Red Hat OpenShift cluster, and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace.

This document gives some details.\n\n\n\n  What is a Web Application Firewall? \n\nA WAF helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet. A WAF is an OSI protocol Layer-7 defense in the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), and it is not designed to defend against all types of attacks.\n\nDeploying a WAF in front of a web application is like placing a shield between the web application and the internet. A proxy server protects a client machine\u2019s identity by using an intermediary (for outgoing traffic), but a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy that protects the server from exposure by having the client's traffic pass through the WAF before reaching the server (for incoming traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Types of attacks WAF can prevent \n\nA WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others. A WAF usually is part of a suite of tools, which together can create a holistic defense against a range of attack vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How a WAF works \n\nA WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic.\n\nThe value of a WAF comes from the speed and ease with which its policy modifications can be implemented, thereby allowing a faster response to varying attack vectors. For example, during a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), rate limiting can be implemented by modifying WAF policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Key benefits of a CIS WAF \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services WAF is an easy way to set up, manage, and customize security rules to protect your web applications from common web threats.

Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations. When you deploy a container from an image, the container spins up with the OS and extra binaries that you described in the image. Just like you protect your virtual or physical machine, you must eliminate known vulnerabilities in the OS and binaries that you use inside the container to protect your app from being accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nTo protect your apps, consider to address the following areas:\n\n\n\n1. Automate the build process and limit permissions: Automate the process to build your container image from your source code to eliminate source code variations and defects. By integrating the build process into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your image is scanned and built only if the image passes the security checks that you specified. To avoid that developers apply hot fixes to sensitive images, limit the number of people in your organization who have access to the build process.\n2. Scan images before they deploy into production: Make sure to scan every image before you deploy a container from it. For example, if you use IBM Cloud Container Registry, all images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities when you push the image to your namespace. If vulnerabilities are found, consider eliminating the vulnerabilities or block deployment for those images. Find a person or team in your organization who is responsible for monitoring and removing vulnerabilities. Depending on your organizational structure, this person might be part of a security, operations, or deployment team.

Review the following suggested guidelines for implementing best practices around your secrets management.\n\n\n\n Define your rotation strategy \n\nAs you use Secrets Manager to design your secrets management strategy, consider how often you want to rotate your secrets based on the internal guidelines for your organization. Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step. For more information about how Secrets Manager handles rotation requests, see [Manually rotating secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotationmanual-rotate-by-type).\n3.

When you create and remove locks on a secret as part of an automated workflow, you can safely delete secrets only after their newest versions are fully deployed to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Create locks on a secret to represent the applications or services that use it. To create a lock from the Secrets Manager UI, go to Secrets page and click the Actions menu ![Actions icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/991f60ddbe3ab0a9aa69481a07a0a73b359fa329/icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg)> Locks.\n\nYou can think of a lock as a kind of mapping that you can create between a secret and the client or application that consumes it. If a secret has a lock attached to it, it means that shouldn't be modified because it's currently in use by your application.\n\nA secret can be unlocked and able to be deleted or modified only after all of its associated locks are removed.\n2. Build an automated flow that can help you to safely delete old or expired secrets from your instance only after your applications have picked up the latest secret versions. For example, consider the following scenario:\n\nYou create a secret that expires in 89 days and is scheduled to be automatically rotated in 90 days.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Example automated workflow for locking secrets.\n\n Description of action \n\n 1 Run an pipeline that obtains the secret from Secrets Manager and deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster so that it can be used by your applications. \n 2 Create locks on the current version of the secret (one lock to for each application or service that uses the secret).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-rotate-secrets"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12384-4-1975", "score": 20.568527221679688, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n* API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Automatically rotating secrets \n\nYou can schedule automatic rotation for secrets by using IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager.\n\nWhen you rotate a secret in your service instance, you create a new version of its value.

A service credential is a collection of important information that is needed to connect to an instance of IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage.

IAM is the Identity and Access Management service of IBM Cloud\u00ae. User authentication and access control happens through IAM when you log in with your IBMId. See how to [retrieve the IAM token](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-retrieve-iam-token-serverless).\n\nAs an administrator or creator of the service instance, you can grant or deny access to other users with whom you may want to share the service instance. All activities on the service instance life cycle management, like modifying the instance configuration, submitting and tracking Spark applications or customizing the instance with custom library sets are controlled through IAM authentication and authorization. See [Granting permissions to users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless) to understand which operations are supported and what is the level of access required for each of those operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n Encrypting at Rest \n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is the recommended data store to store the data required for executing Spark jobs on the cluster. IBM Cloud Object Storage comes with default built-in encryption. See [Encrypting your data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-encryptionencryption).\n\nIn addition, or as an alternative to using IBM Cloud Object Storage storage encryption in analytic scenarios for large-scale data, you can use Parquet modular encryption, especially when fine-grained access control is important.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore.

For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers.

If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice.

You can purchase and manage bandwidth metering for classic in two ways, through metering on individual devices, or through collective-metering when you add a device to a bandwidth pool.\n\nAll inbound and outbound bandwidth inside the IBM Cloud Classic infrastructure is unlimited and cost-free for your servers' use. Public egress bandwidth is charged on a tiered basis, with a set allocation for each month of your servers' use.\n\nBandwidth usage is measured as egress traffic on a device's public interfaces.\n\nBandwidth allocations are reserved for all public egress network usage. Devices with individual bandwidth metering and pool-based metering are all measured unless the device is ordered on the private network only.\n\nBandwidth allocation is a threshold where usage below the threshold is free or included, while usage in excess of the threshold is billed as a bandwidth overage. Bandwidth overages are billed individually per server or device, unless they participate in a bandwidth pool.\n\nDevices added to a bandwidth pool contribute both their bandwidth allocation and bandwidth usage to form aggregated totals for the pool. If the pool usage exceeds the total pool allocation, the account owner is billed a consolidated pool overage fee.\n\n\n\n About device bandwidth \n\nYou can manage each device's bandwidth allocation. When you provision certain devices, you can select the amount of bandwidth that you want to allocate to that device. For each device, you pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth allocation during a billing cycle, and receive a notification when the device is at risk of overage for the billing cycle.

You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAs an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.\n\nWhen you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the IBM Cloud console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account.\n\nYou can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.\n\nSetting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you are notified immediately by email.\n\nTo view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03765-1346-3055", "score": 14.42509937286377, "text": "\nIf you're a new Pay-As-You-Go account owner that is located in the US and you are paying with a credit card, can you add multiple cards to the account, replace your default card with a saved one, or edit the details of a card.
