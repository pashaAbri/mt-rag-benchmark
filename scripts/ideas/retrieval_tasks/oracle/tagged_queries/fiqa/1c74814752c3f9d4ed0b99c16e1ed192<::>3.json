    "text": "In the U.S., most salaries are expressed as \"gross salaries\" before individual taxes are deducted. You must report all income from work, regardless of whether you save, spend, or keep it aside. This includes income from non-tax-advantaged accounts, as well as any gains or losses and dividends received. Gains and losses are realized when you actually sell, and is the difference between the price you bought for, and the price you sold for. Gains are taxed at the capital gains rate, either short-term or long-term depending on how long you owned the stock",

        "text": "\n\"In the U.S., virtually all salaries are expressed as \"\"gross salaries\"\", which are before the taxes that the individual must pay on their income. The numbers shown in the links are almost certainly gross salary figures. However, the \"\"gross salary\"\" is not the entire \"\"total compensation\"\" number, which is the total value of all compensation and benefits that the employee receives for his work. Total compensation includes not only salary and bonuses, but the cost or value of any employer-paid healthcare, retirement, company car, expense account, stock options, and other valuable goods or services. That's still not the total amount of money the company has to pay to have you; there are employer-paid payroll taxes totaling 6.2% of your gross salary, plus practical costs like the cost of your computer, cubicle or office furniture, and the portion of utility costs that keep you well-lit, clean and comfortable. This complete number is called \"\"total employee cost\"\", and the general rule of thumb is that it's double your gross cash compensation (salary + bonuses). Lastly, $100k in California isn't worth as much, in real terms, as $100k in other parts of the U.S. The cost of living in California, especially in Silicon Valley where the majority of the people who make six figures by being C++ programmers are located, is ridiculously expensive. There are other tech hubs in the U.S., like DFW, Austin TX, Atlanta GA, St Louis MO, Raleigh NC, etc where people earn less, but also spend less to live and so can use more of their salary in a \"\"discretionary\"\" manner.\"",

                    "model_text": "|user|: Alternative means of salary for my employees\n|assistant|: According to the documents, there are different ways to consider salary compensation besides the traditional gross salary. Total compensation includes salary and bonuses, as well as the cost or value of employer-paid healthcare, retirement, company cars, expense accounts, stock options, and other valuable goods or services. Additionally, the total employee cost is generally double the gross cash compensation (salary + bonuses) and includes employer-paid payroll taxes and practical costs like equipment and utilities. It's also important to consider the cost of living in the area where your employees live, as this can significantly impact the actual value of their salaries. For example, $100k in California may not go as far as $100k in other parts of the U.S. Finally, it's worth noting that salary pay does not directly translate to hourly wages, as salaried employees are compensated for a week of work, which may require more or less than 40 hours.\n|user|: Do employers need to report their employee's salaries and withhold money for income tax purposes?\n|assistant|: Yes. In many countries, employers are required to report their employee's salaries and withhold a portion for income tax, which is commonly known as \"pay as you earn,\" \"withholding taxes,\" or taxing \"at the source.\" Your employer uses the W4 form in the USA to determine how much to withhold from your wages. If you leave everything at default, your salary is your only taxable income, and you only benefit from default deductions. Your employer will calculate your tax withholding based on this information. When you start a new job, your employer will typically ask you to fill out a tax form such as the W-4 Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate so they can withhold the correct federal income tax from your wages. If your employer doesn't do this, you are responsible for calculating and filing your income taxes, especially if you are self-employed, an independent contractor, or paid under the table. If your employer is reputable, they will provide you with additional information, usually in February. You must file your taxes correctly before the IRS tax deadline, generally April 15th for most people.\n|user|: In that case, could you please explain why I still have to pay income tax?"

Gains and losses are realized when you actually sell, and is the difference between the price you bought for, and the price you sold for.  Gains are taxed at the capital gains rate, either short-term or long-term depending on how long you owned the stock.   The tax system is complex, and these are just the general rules.  There are lots of complications and special situations, some things are different depending on how much you make, etc.  The IRS has all of the forms and rules online.  You might also consider having a professional do you taxes the first time, just to ensure that they are done correctly.  You can then use that as an example in future years.",

    "original_text": "Even though your employer withholds taxes from your wages, this might not cover all the taxes you owe. The withheld taxes are based on your income and the deductions you claim on your W-4 form. If you have additional sources of income, such as investment income or self-employment income, you may owe taxes on that income as well. Similarly, if you have deductible expenses that reduce your taxable income, you may be entitled to a refund when you file your taxes. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that your W-4 form accurately reflects your tax situation to avoid owing taxes or overpaying them. If you find that you owe taxes despite your employer's withholding, you may need to adjust your W-4 form or make estimated tax payments throughout the year to avoid penalties and interest charges."
