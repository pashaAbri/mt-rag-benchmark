        "text": "\nFirst, you need to be aware that the credit score reported by Mint is Equifax Credit Score. Equifax Credit Score, like FICO, Vantagescore, and others, is based on a proprietary formula that is not publicly available.  Every score is calculated with a different formula, and can vary from each other widely.  Lenders almost exclusively only use FICO scores, so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use. Second, understand that the advice you see from places like Mint and Credit Karma will almost always tell you that you don't have enough credit card accounts.  The reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications.  They have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards. Finally, realize that credit score is just a number, and is only useful for a limited number of things.  Higher is better to a point, and after that, you get no benefit from increasing your score.   My advice to you is this: Don't stress out about your credit score, especially a free score reported by Credit Karma or Mint.  If you really have a desire to find out your score, you can pay FICO to get your actual score, but it's not cheap.  You can also sometimes get your FICO score by applying for a loan and asking the lender.  I last saw my FICO scores (there were three, one from each credit bureau) when I applied for a mortgage a couple of years ago, and the mortgage rep gave them to me for free.  But honestly, knowing your score doesn't do much for you, as the best way to increase it is to simply make your payments on time and wait. Don't give in to bad conventional advice from places that are funded by the financial services industry.  The thing that makes your credit score go up is a long history of paying your bills on time.  Despite what you commonly read about credit scores, I'm not convinced that you can radically boost your scores by having lots of open credit card accounts.  At the time I applied for my last mortgage, I only had 2 open credit cards (still true), and the oldest open account was about 1.5 years old.  The average of my 3 scores was just over 800.  But I've been paying my bills on time for at least 20 years now.  Only get credit cards that you actually want, and close the ones you don't want.",

    "original_text": "A credit score, such as the FICO score, is calculated using a proprietary formula that takes into account various factors related to an individual's credit history. The exact formula is not publicly disclosed, but the five main factors that typically influence a FICO score are:\n1. Payment history: Late payments can negatively affect your score, while on-time payments can improve it.\n2. Credit utilization: This refers to how much of your available credit you are currently using. Lower is better, but having 0% usage is not ideal either. Aiming for 10% or less is a good goal.\n3. Credit history: This is based on the average age of all your accounts, including credit cards and loans. Older accounts are generally better for your score.\n4. Credit mix: Having a diverse mix of credit types (e.g., credit cards, mortgages, auto loans) can positively impact your score.\n5. New credit: Applying for new credit can result in a temporary decrease in your score due to the credit inquiries made during the application process. These inquiries remain on your report for two years.\nIt is important to note that errors and fraud can also impact your credit score, so regularly reviewing your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) is recommended."
