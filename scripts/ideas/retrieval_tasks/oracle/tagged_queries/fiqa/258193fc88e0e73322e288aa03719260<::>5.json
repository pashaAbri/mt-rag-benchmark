However, it's important to clarify that you cannot deduct the value of your time or services, including the income lost while working as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization. This includes charitable donations of time or services. However, you can deduct actual costs associated with volunteering, such as expenses for equipment, supplies, or wages paid to employees or contractors for work related to the charity. If you have donated items like a published book that you authored (not specifically written for the organization), you might be able to deduct its fair market value. In summary, while you cannot directly deduct the value of your time or services, you can deduct certain expenses related to charitable activities, which may help lower your tax burden.In fact, t tax deductions allow you to give to charities from your gross salary, not your net salary. The Charitable donations can be deducted from your income, and in that way make your taxable income lower, hence lower taxes. That's the meaning of \"\"tax deductible\"\". As to \"\"if I donate it then the money will be given right to the charity instead of spread out to many other places\"\" - taxes are being used by the government based on its own decisions (presumably made by elected officials thus representing the will of the voters).

For example, you can donate money to your temple, to a church for the building fund, to a hospital to buy a new x-ray machine,orphanage ,a gay rights organization , to  Red Cross for a specific disaster or even donate money to to the scouts for a new dining hall, etc. A real real charity would be glad for your donation anytime.\n|user|: assets\n|assistant|: In fact, depending on the size of the donation, you may be able to reduce taxes further by donating appreciated assets, such as stock, bonds, or mutual fund shares that have gone up a lot.

For instance, when you donate  you should talk to the charity about what's best. But for larger donations, where larger probably starts at a few thou, it can save you a nice chunk of change is better than donate cash.You can get a lot from that. So you get to both (a) donate untaxed money and then (b) deduct that unrealized money from your income total on your tax return. You can once a year evaluate all your investments and find some where the market value has increased. Then donate some of those share to the organization closed to your heat.

Well, even if you donated all of it to charity to that you don't have to pay income taxes on it, you would still have to pay social security taxes, and it would still affect your social security benefits when you retire. If you're saying that the organization receiving the money is itself a charity, as opposed to donating the money to some other organization that is a charity, than you usually have to be registered as a charity with the IRS to avoid income taxes. There are still forms to file to report the income, but you wouldn't have to pay taxes. There are some exceptions to the requirement to register, basically if your organization is very small and for certain religious organizations.",
