First, the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions (FICO's customers) to assess the risk of loans that they make.  The second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money. FICO scoring prefers to see a large number of accounts, low utilization, high average account age, low number of inquiries, no late payment.A credit card can be a long running line of credit that will help to boost your FICO score. However if you have student loans, a mortgage, or car payments those will work just as well.  FICO that stands for Fair Isaac Corporation uses information from the 3 major credit bureaus   Equifax, Transunion and Experian. It is important to note that FICO score tracks credit not checking or savings.",

        "text": "\n\"It all comes down to how the loan itself is structured and reported - the exact details of how they run the loan paperwork, and how/if they report the activity on the loan to one of the credit bureaus (and which one they report to). It can go generally one of three ways: A) The loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. In this scenario, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially this will generally drop related credit scores somewhat (it's a \"\"hard pull\"\", new account with zero history, and increased debt), but over time this can have a positive effect on both people's credit rating. This is the typical scenario one might logically expect to be the norm, and it effects both parties credit just as if they were a sole signor for the loan. And as always, if the loan is not paid properly it will negatively effect both people's credit, and the owner of the loan can choose to come after either or both parties in whatever order they want. B) The loan company just runs the loan with one person, and only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the co-signor), leaving the other as just a backup. If you aren't paying close attention they may even arrange it where the initial party wanting to take the loan isn't even on most of the paperwork. This let the person trying to run the loan get something accepted that might not have been otherwise, or save some time, or was just an error. In this case it will have no effect on Person A's credit. We've had a number of question like this, and this isn't really a rare occurrence. Never assume people selling you things are necessarily accurate or honest - always verify. C) The loan company just doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, or does so incorrectly. They are under no obligation to report to credit agencies, it's strictly up to them. If you don't pay then they can report it as something \"\"in collections\"\".",

However a loan with a cosigner can bring a lot problems. In the first scenario, if the loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner, then both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially, this might decrease related credit scores slightly due to a hard pull, new account with zero history, and increased debt.

In the third scenario, if the loan company doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, there will be no direct impact on the borrower's credit. However, if the loan goes into collections and is reported as such, it would negatively affect the borrower's credit.

The co-signer is responsible for the loan just as much as borrower is. In fact if the borrower does not pay, the co-signer is liable for making the payments. When you co-sign a loan, you are essentially saying \"\"I will pay this loan if the other person can't.\"\"\" The cos-signer is 100% liable if for any reason you can't or won't pay. Also this shows up on a credit report just like it's your debt. This limits the amount you can borrow for any reason.\n|user|: It is better never be a co-signer.\n|assistant|: Actually being a cosigner for a loan involves significant responsibilities. It is the same as borrowing the money in your name and giving it right over to the borrower. Before accept be a cosigner, think it, you're just as responsible for the loan payments as the original borrower, and given that you were a useful co-signer, probably much more likely to be able to come up with the money.  If you can't pay, the lender comes after both of you  if the bank is asking for a co-signer its because they are not very confident that the applicant is going to be paying back the loan.Never co-sign a loan for someone, especially family .Taking out a loan for yourself is bad enough, but co-signing a loan is just plain stupid.  Besides, co-signer can become enraged if the original borrower does not pay the loan. As I mentioned before, be careful.

The purpose of the credit score system is two-fold.  First, the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions (FICO's customers) to assess the risk of loans that they make.  This is probably based on science, although the FICO studies and even the FICO score formula are proprietary secrets. The second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money.  And they have done a great job of that.  If you think you might need a loan in the future, perhaps a mortgage or a car loan, you need a credit score.  And the only way to get a credit score is to start borrowing money now that you don't need.   Yes, someone with a good income and a long history of paying utility bills on time would be a great credit risk for a mortgage.  However, that person will have no credit score, and therefore be declared by FICO as a bad credit risk.  On the other hand, someone with a low income, who struggles, but succeeds, to make the minimum payment on their credit card, would have a better credit score.  The advice offered to the first person is start borrowing money now, even though you don't need it. I'm not anti-credit card.  I use a credit card responsibly, paying it off in full every month.  I use it for the convenience.  I don't worry at all about my credit score, but I've been told it is great.  However, there are some people that cannot use a credit card responsibly.  The temptation is too great.  Perhaps they are like problem gamblers, I don't know.  But FICO and the financial services industry have created a system that makes a credit card a necessity in many ways.  These are the people that get hurt in the current system.",

Your score is not improved by maintaining a balance, only by using the card(s) regularly. No need to carry charges month to month and pay interest, rather, have the bill reflect a 1-9% utilization.  I'd recommend Credit Karma to see how the factors affect your score. FICO scoring prefers to see a large number of accounts, low utilization, high average account age, low number of inquiries, no late payments. CK will let you see a simulated score and how it changes based on these variables.\"",

In addition to the \"\"classic\"\" version, FICO offers \"\"Industry Option\"\" versions customized for auto loans, credit cards, installment loans, personal finance loans, and insurance. These have a score range of 250 to 900, so the scores are not fully comparable with \"\"classic\"\" versions. As of 2015, Auto and Bankcard scores are available from myFICO as described here. Citibank provides the Equifax FICO 8 Bankcard score free each month to credit cards holders. Each credit agency (Transunion, Equifax, and Experian) uses a customized version of each FICO edition. As a result, a consumer's FICO scores from each agency may differ even when all credit information is identical among the agencies. Because there are many FICO versions, when a score is received, it's helpful to know which version it is. If a lender provides a credit score, ask for details such as which credit agency was used, which FICO edition was used, and whether the score is an Industry Option version. The lender may not always be willing or able to provide the answers, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

Lenders use FICO scores to assess an individual's creditworthiness, or their likelihood of repaying a loan. A FICO score is a type of credit score that ranges from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating lower credit risk. The score is based on information from the three major credit reporting agencies: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Factors that influence a FICO score include payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new credit inquiries, and types of credit used."
