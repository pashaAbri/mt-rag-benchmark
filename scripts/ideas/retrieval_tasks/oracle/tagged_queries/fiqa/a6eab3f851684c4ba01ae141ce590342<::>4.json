    "text": "Yes, there are several downsides to investing in foreign markets. One of the main risks is exchange rate risk, which occurs when there is a currency movement that makes your investment worth less, regardless of the stock's performance. This can be mitigated using exchange rate swaps. Another risk is political risk, which includes potential issues such as a country deciding to seize foreign nationals' assets or applying sanctions that make it difficult to get your money back. Additionally, there may be a lack of understanding of foreign countries' laws, tax codes, and customs related to investments, and it can be challenging to stay informed about company-specific issues in foreign countries. As an individual investor, it may not be feasible to dedicate the necessary time to monitor international relations and the foreign country's news. Furthermore, foreign stocks may be thinly traded on your local stock market, making it harder to buy and sell, and you may be late to the game if there is a sudden change in the share price in the original country. Lastly, for foreign stocks, news and intraday price moves often happen while you're asleep, making it challenging to respond promptly.",

        "text": "\nForeign stocks have two extra sources of risk attached to them; exchange rate and political.  Exchange rate risk is obvious; if I buy a stock in a foreign currency and there is a currency movement that makes that investment worth less I lose money no matter what the stock does. This can be offset using exchange rate swaps. (This is ceteris paribus, of course; changes in exchange rate can give a comparative advantage to international and exporting companies that will improve the fundamentals and so increase the price of the stock relative to a local firm. The economics of the firms in particular are not explored in this answer as it would get too complicated and long if I did.) Political risk relates not only to the problems surrounding international politics such as a country deciding that foreign nationals may no longer own shares in their national industries or deciding to seize foreign nationals' assets as happens in some areas. Your home country may also decide to apply sanctions to the country in which you are invested thus making it impossible to get your money back even though the foreign country will allow you to redeem them or sell. Diplomatic relations and trade agreements tend to be difficult. There are further problems in lack of understanding of foreign countries' laws, tax code, customs etc. relating to investments and the necessity to find legal representation in a country you may never have visited if there are issues. There is also a hidden risk in that, as an individual investor, you are not likely to be reading the local financial news for that country regularly enough to spot company specific issues arising. By the time these issues get into international media its far too late as all of the local investors have sold out of their positions already. The risks are probably no different if you have the time to monitor international relations and the foreign country's news, and have FX swaps in place to counteract FX risk as the funds and investment banks do but as an individual investor the time required is not feasible.",
