Worst case scenario, everybody can't pay back money and keep accumulating debt, which would lead to a complete collapse of the European economy, resulting in a global economic meltdown. Germany currently are in control of al lot of countries debts (especially Ireland) which means that they will become the main players in decisions regarding the proliferation/faltering of the european economy in the future.",

The idea is that the chain reaction collapse of the European banking system can be avoided by plugging the holes in the dam in Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Ireland. But it is a crazy idea. Next comes France, and then what? At some point there is not enough money to plug the holes and the entire facade collapses anyways.  Adults would dismantle the Eurozone now and let each country see to itself. Let the banks collapse. Capital (in the form of dollars, gold, etc) will reappear and means will evolve rapidly to connect capital with people who need loans for business.   Consumer loans are going the way of the dodo bird.\"",

Because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that Greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues.  The problem is that public and private projects in Greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws. A good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside Greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use. In summary the Greek government would be even more debt, the economy would see very little benefit, no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure.  Even if Greece hadn’t joined the Euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this. The global economic crisis has made the situation much worse, it is not the cause of the crisis, at least for Greece.",

They basically say that UK bank exposure to Greece is less than 6 billions pounds (BOE data), so there is no reason to be worried now. The main issue of this crisis is not the Greek exit from the Euro on its own (it seems to be considered almost a fact by CITI, and by MS at 35% probability, Profumo ex CEO of UNICREDIT, says the possibility are more than 50%) – the main issue is that other countries like Italy and Spain might follow the same fate. If they do, the exposure of many foreign banks (including the UK ones) to their debts is not negligible (191,80 billions pounds for UK banks) moreover other EU banks (even the German ones) exposed to Italy and to Spain will suffer too, and this suffering will be translated into more suffering for UK banks exposed also to Germany and to France. That's why you read Euro doom articles like this one from Paul Krugman (who won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.)",
