There should be no problem with this. However, whether or not the account is free may depend on the bank's policies. Some banks offer free checking accounts, especially if there will be minimal activity. It is recommended to research different banks to find one that offers free checking accounts. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that as a freelancer, it is a good idea to separate your business finances from your personal finances, so having a second account for your business can be helpful.\nRegarding the documents you provided, none of them mention anything about the cost of opening a second bank account. Therefore, I cannot give you a specific answer based on the documents."
