It is impossible to say ALL of anything is a certain way. I'm not suggesting that at all. I'm going to specifically talk about averages. It seems like you've never been around the average.  The average minimum wage employee doesn't have a high school education. It is fairly safe to say that they continuously are not developing skills that provide value both to themselves and others. If a person refuses to provide more for society, should society fill the gap?  You suggest that people who are poor didn't get there because of their own right. Are people who are self-made millionaires (on average) good with finances? Why would that be? If yes, why do you assume those that are successful are so because of their own merit but cannot be blamed for failure?  Seattle is a nice place. My exterior painter is doing a job there right now. It's a 3 month job. He is painting 1,000 apartments. He took 7 guys with him that he pays around $1,750 a week plus room and board. He had to take 7 guys with him because he can't find workers up in Washington. Can you imagine that? People in Seattle have not developed the skill of exterior painting. That's the reality of your job market. Even further, companies do have massive incentives to move to cheaper locations. The starting salary of large corporations varies wildly based on cost of living. Goldman Sachs will offer nearly $100k a year starting to work in the NYC branch compared to $65-70k in Houston.",

I was miserable. The job was to do only as I was told. Also, they changed my project scope to something completely different after 4 months. I also was in a terrible city with no friends. I hated my job and eventually I hated my life.  I've since moved back to where I went to college.  I hate that business publications talk about MBA's like we're all mindless robots looking for the highest paycheck at Goldman Sachs.

If willing to start near bottom, go to your business school and start applying to bank associate programs.  Sounds like you would like sales and trading more than M&amp;A, so focus there. 2.   If you got in at associate level, you would do 1-3 months of training and then get assigned a desk.  Finance going through a tough time right now, so trajectory isn't what it used to be.  Expect to be a VP after 2-4 years, then its all dependent on luck and skill. 3.   If you land a job at a top 15 bank, you should be making total comp of 150k or more after the first year.  Salaries not quite at 150k, but most VPS make over 150k salary, not to mention bigger bonus's.  4.   If you did M&amp;A you would be working very serious hours.  If you go into Sales and Trading your hours will be anywhere from 40 to 60 hours a week depending on the desk.  Trading hours tend to be the shortest. 5.  Boston isn't a hot bed for i-banking finance.  NYC, London, Sing, Hong Kong tend to be the places to be.  I know nobody in Boston that could help.",
