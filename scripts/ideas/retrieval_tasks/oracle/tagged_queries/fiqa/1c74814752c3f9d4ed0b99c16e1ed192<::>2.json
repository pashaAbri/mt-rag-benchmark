    "text": "Yes. In many countries, employers are required to report their employee's salaries and withhold a portion for income tax, which is commonly known as \"pay as you earn,\" \"withholding taxes,\" or taxing \"at the source.\" Your employer uses the W4 form in the USA to determine how much to withhold from your wages. If you leave everything at default, your salary is your only taxable income, and you only benefit from default deductions. Your employer will calculate your tax withholding based on this information. When you start a new job, your employer will typically ask you to fill out a tax form such as the W-4 Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate so they can withhold the correct federal income tax from your wages. If your employer doesn't do this, you are responsible for calculating and filing your income taxes, especially if you are self-employed, an independent contractor, or paid under the table. If your employer is reputable, they will provide you with additional information, usually in February. You must file your taxes correctly before the IRS tax deadline, generally April 15th for most people. Do I have to worry about money in my bank account? Unless you have a significant amount in your bank savings account earning interest, you won't have to pay any sort of tax on money in your bank account. If you do earn enough taxable interest, the bank will send you the proper forms to file your taxes.",

        "text": "\nMany countries have employers report their employees' salaries and withhold some money for income tax purposes (it's called “pay as you earn”, “withholding taxes” or taxing “at the source”). Often the system is designed in such a way that most people actually pay too much and can get money back at the end of the year. In that case, the salary you receive can certainly be considered a “net salary”. Depending on the tax system, individuals might need to file a separate tax returns to report any other income (investments, rents, whatever) or benefit from tax incentives but it can also be optional. If you live in such a country and your situation is simple enough that there are no applicable deductibles, you might simply choose to forgo it and let your employer take care of everything.",

Leaving everything at default would mean that your salary is your only taxable income, and you only take default deductions. Your employee will calculate your tax withholding based on that. But, if your salary is >200k, I assume that you have other income (investment/capital gains, interest on your bank account), which you will have to pay taxes on. You're probably going to have some deductible expenses (business/partnership expenses, mortgage interest, donations, college funds etc) as well. So it is very likely, unless you're really not smart about money, that you have more to do with your taxes than just the employers' withholding.",

Unless you have a significant amount in your bank savings account earning interest (see \"\"Should I save for the future?\"\" below), you won't have to pay any sort of tax on money in your bank account. If you do earn enough taxable interest, the bank will send you the proper forms to file your taxes. How do I file taxes? While it won't apply till next year, you will likely be able to fill out a Form 1040EZ Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers With No Dependents, as long as you don't have any kids in the meantime. ;-) You will either mail in the paper form (available at your local IRS office, post office, public library, etc.) or file electronically. There will be a lot of information on how to do this when the time comes, so don't worry about details just yet. Assuming your all paid up on your taxes (very likely unless you get a good paying job and take a lot of deductions throughout the year on your W-4), you'll probably get money back from the IRS when you file your tax return. As I mentioned above, if you have a bank account, you can opt to have your refund money returned electronically and get it much sooner than if you didn't have a bank account (again, possibly saving you literal months of waiting). Should I save for my future? If so, how much? Any good articles?",
