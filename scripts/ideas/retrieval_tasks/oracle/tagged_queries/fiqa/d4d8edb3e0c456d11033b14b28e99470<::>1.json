If prices are rising it will probably be a false economy to delay your house purchase. Say you pay off a £5,000 student loan, thus delaying your house purchase another year you could well end up forking out an extra £10,000 on the mortgage due to the rise in house prices. Of course, if the housing market is falling then, without a doubt, pay off the student debt.",

        "text": "\n\"The only way to \"\"roll\"\" debt into a home purchase is to have sufficient down payment.  Under the \"\"new\"\" lending rules that took effect in Canada earlier this year, you must have at least 5% of the purchase price as a down payment.  If you have $60,000 in additional debt, the total amount of mortgage still cannot be greater than 95% of the purchase price.  Below is an example. Purchase price of home $200,000. Maximum mortgage $190,000 (95% of purchase price) Total outside debt $60,000 That means the mortgage (other than the current debt of $60k) can only be $130,000 This means you would need a down payment of $70,000. Also keep in mind that I have not included any other legal fees, real estate commissions, etc in this example. Since it is safe to assume that you do not have $70k available for a down payment, renting and paying down the debt is likely the better route.  Pay off the credit card(s) first as they have the higher interest amount. Best of luck!\"",

    "original_text": "Based on the information provided in the documents, if you have a significant amount of debt and the housing market is rising, it may be more financially advantageous to rent and focus on paying off your debt. This is because, as stated in the first document, delaying your house purchase in a rising housing market could lead to paying more on the mortgage due to increased house prices. The second document explains that in order to roll debt into a home purchase, you need to have a sufficient down payment. However, if you have a lot of debt, it's unlikely that you have the necessary funds for a substantial down payment. Therefore, renting and paying off your debt first might be the better option."
