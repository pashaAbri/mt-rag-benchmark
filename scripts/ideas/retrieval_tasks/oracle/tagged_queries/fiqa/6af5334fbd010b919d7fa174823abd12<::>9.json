The reason for the age requirement is that if you're not 18, any contract you sign can be canceled (made invalid) by either you or your parents. This means that it would be legal for you to ask the bank for a $1000 loan and for the bank to provide it, if you're under 18.",

So it would be completely legal for you to go to the bank, ask for a $1000 loan, and for the bank to give you the loan. But then you could spend the money, and tell the bank \"\"sorry, I changed my mind, I don't want that loan, and sorry again, but the money is gone\"\". At that point, there would be nothing the bank could do to get their money back.  Obviously, banks don't like this, so they won't lend you money.\"",
