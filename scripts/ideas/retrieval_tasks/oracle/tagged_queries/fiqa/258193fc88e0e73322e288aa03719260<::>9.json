                  "model_text": "|user|: Can capital expenses for volunteer purposes be deducted from income?\n|assistant|: Indeed you can't deduct the value of your time or services, including the  value of income lost while you work as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization. You can only deduct  what something cost  even if you had done volunteer work for a charity as a sole prop you could only deduct your actual costs. If you paid an employee to do charity work or to learn something related to the business that would be deductible as a normal business expense. It would be d be impossible for the IRS to determine the value of your time and it would open the tax system to an enormous amount of fraud (think of being able to make up time spent or writing off time spent volunteering at a soup kitchen or any other charity). Nevertheless, you can write off expenses you have involved in doing the work, equipment and supplies used to do the work along with any wages you paid an employee or contractor to do said work.\n|user|: In other words, charitable donations, capital expenses or my time could be make my taxesa lower, right?\n|assistant|: There are some tax-deductible options related to charitable activities. However, it's important to clarify that you cannot deduct the value of your time or services, including the income lost while working as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization. This includes charitable donations of time or services. However, you can deduct actual costs associated with volunteering, such as expenses for equipment, supplies, or wages paid to employees or contractors for work related to the charity. If you have donated items like a published book that you authored (not specifically written for the organization), you might be able to deduct its fair market value. In summary, while you cannot directly deduct the value of your time or services, you can deduct certain expenses related to charitable activities, which may help lower your tax burden.In fact, t tax deductions allow you to give to charities from your gross salary, not your net salary. The Charitable donations can be deducted from your income, and in that way make your taxable income lower, hence lower taxes. That's the meaning of \"\"tax deductible\"\". As to \"\"if I donate it then the money will be given right to the charity instead of spread out to many other places\"\" - taxes are being used by the government based on its own decisions (presumably made by elected officials thus representing the will of the voters). Charities use the money based on their defined goals. Giving money to a charity will ensure it is used for the specific goal the charity declared, and that's the way for you to funnel money to the goals of your preference/choice. \n|user|: what kind of organizations could I do donate some money and help me to pay less taxes.\n|assistant|: To lower your taxable income through charitable donations, you should consider donating to organizations that are qualified for tax-deductible contributions, making sure the giving money  will be used for the specific goal the charity declared, and that's the way for you to funnel money to the goals of your preference/choice.  For example, you can donate money to your temple, to a church for the building fund, to a hospital to buy a new x-ray machine,orphanage ,a gay rights organization , to  Red Cross for a specific disaster or even donate money to to the scouts for a new dining hall, etc. A real real charity would be glad for your donation anytime.\n|user|: assets\n|assistant|: In fact, depending on the size of the donation, you may be able to reduce taxes further by donating appreciated assets, such as stock, bonds, or mutual fund shares that have gone up a lot. That lets you dodge the capital gains tax on redeeming the shares, and if you're donating to a tax-exempt organization they don't have to pay that tax either. you can talk to the charity about donate them assets. For instance, when you donate  you should talk to the charity about what's best. But for larger donations, where larger probably starts at a few thou, it can save you a nice chunk of change is better than donate cash.You can get a lot from that. So you get to both (a) donate untaxed money and then (b) deduct that unrealized money from your income total on your tax return. You can once a year evaluate all your investments and find some where the market value has increased. Then donate some of those share to the organization closed to your heat. No special advance planning necessary. Note that your tax consequences could be more complicated depending on your exact situation.\n|user|: By the way, if I do a donation in cash for a foreigner organization, could it be used as tax deduction?\n|assistant|: I do not have specific information about donation to an organization  outside of the US related to taxes deduction. However, in UK  you can set up a CAF (Charities Aid foundation) Charity Account. This allows you to donate to charities anonymously, while still allowing the recipient to benefit from Gift Aid (where they can reclaim the income tax you'd paid on the donation). You can even use this account to donate to overseas charities if you're donating at least £250. Or you can use a different intermediary such as BT MyDonate or The Big Give or another intermediary.In general, If you living in the U.S if you are donating this money to charity, you would have to declare the income, and then declare a deduction for the charitable contribution.\n|user|: What the most i can donate and declare  as charitable contribution?\n|assistant|: At least on 25K. Accordingly to  IRS publication, the limits depend on the types of organization you're donating to, and the types of property you're donating. Some donations may be limited to the maximum of 20% of your AGI. Bottom line - the maximum you can deduct in almost all circumstances would be 50% of the AGI (very few exceptions allow deducting up to 100% of your AGI). Worth mentioning that whatever you cannot deduct this year - you can roll over to the next year. Nevertheless is good to note that for many people, giving to charity will have minimal effect on their taxes. Non-profits love to attract donations by saying the money is tax deductible, but for most people, it doesn't work out that way. You will only itemize deductions if they exceed your standard deduction. The IRS allows you to either \"\"itemize\"\" your deductions (where you list each deduction you can take) or take the \"\"standard deduction. Indeed give to charity because you want that charity to have your money. Tax implications will be minimal; \n|user|: Could I put in my will donations for my dearests organization after my death?\n|assistant|: Yes, you can include charitable donations in your will. . You can even setup a charitable trust to spread the donations out over year or decade. You could even make it so that you can live off the interest until you die, and then the rest goes to the charity. You may also approach some charities with this idea. They can set it up so that the extra funds, if you die early, go to the charity. They will set it up as an annuity through an insurance company they work with.\n|user|: Is it necessary to have a will?\n|assistant|: Having a will is highly recommended to ensure that your wishes regarding the distribution of your assets are carried out after your heirs and the best away is to assign a good lawyer. No matter your net worth, it's important to have a basic estate plan in place. Such a plan ensures that your family and financial goals are met after you die. Beside having a good attorney , the will is include in your estate plan and you also should include  a living will or health-care proxy (medical power of attorney). Keep in mind when you do your estate plan and will  that there are different federal and state laws governing states. Take a  inventory of your assets (investments, retirement savings, insurance policies, and real estate or business interests).It is very important you have a trust, that are e legal mechanisms that let you put conditions on how and when your assets will be distributed upon your death. They also allow you to reduce your estate and gift taxes and to distribute assets to your heirs without the cost, delay and publicity of probate court, which administers wills. Some also offer greater protection of your assets from creditors and lawsuits. 6\n|user|: How I get a good lawyer to do my estate plan and my will?"

Come up with a reasonable and fair plan for resolving each situation, that you are willing to commit to, life and breath, for real, no exit.  Put all of it into a legal commitment between you two.  However this is a fearless, searching and even ruthless contemplation, requiring a level of intimacy and personal responsibility you may not be comfortable with. and there's absolutely no room for dancing around unspoken questions.  So in essence, it puts the hardest stuff up-front.  If you put that much thought and honesty into it, you'll probably be OK. But you probably won't want to be that honest, or won't want to do the deal after you do.",

        "text": "\n\"Yes, an estate plan can be very important.  Estate planning - typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses. Guardians are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in incapacity. In general, your \"\"estate\"\" includes all of your assets, less all debt, plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust. The biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or incapacity prevents you from acting for yourself. In addition, tax minimization is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates. To create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan, you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney. When you consult with an estate planning attorney, the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs, what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are tax-minimization strategies that would be appropriate and appealing; what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of incapacity; and any complicating family issues. To deal with these issues, your attorney will need full and accurate information about you, including: When an estate plan is created, be sure you understand what the attorney is saying. Estate planning ideas can be confusing. It is also appropriate and expected for you to ask about the attorney's fee for any legal service.
