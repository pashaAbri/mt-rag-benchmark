If you open a second account at a different bank, you may have more options for products like Mortgage or credit extensions since you are not limited to just one institution. If you use the same bank, that would make it harder to lose track of, and you could probably still get reports summarizing the balances across them. Additionally, occasionally there are also perks like the bank spontaneously offering you increased credit or even a whole line of credit because the bank has your data already.",
