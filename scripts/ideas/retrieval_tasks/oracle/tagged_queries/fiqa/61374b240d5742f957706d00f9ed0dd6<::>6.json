Save some money out of each paycheck even if it is only $50. Now for the bad news. $1mm is not enough to retire on. The general rule of thumb is that you should have 25x your annual expenses saved when you retire. The only time to stop saving money for retirement is when you have enough money to retire tomorrow. Remember: you are likely to live to 100, so you better save enough to live that long. I don't trust social security to be there. 35 is not mid-life. You're on the tail end of the age to get started on retirement planning. There's a table on one of the FIRE (Financial Independent, Retire Early) websites that shows a graph between % of income saved and the number of years it takes to save enough to be financially independent.",

A few dozen people bite, buy up a few thousand shares each (remember the shares are trading for pennies), then when the rise in demand pushes up the price enough for the scammer to make a decent buck, he cashes out, the price falls based on the resulting glut of stock, and the victims lose their money.

Pump-and-dump scams are indeed very real, but the scale of a single scam isn't anywhere near the type of heist you see in movies like Trading Places. Stock market is like poker: you don't take the same risks when it is fake money and thus you don't learn the same lessons from your mistakes. Picking individual stocks and hoping for the value to go up in a relatively short time-frame is similar to gambling (rule #0: use only money that you don't need). Therefore, it is crucial to educate yourself and be smart when engaging in stock trading.\n|user|: Should I only invest in mutual funds?\n|assistant|: Choosing and investing in only one stock is risky. You can lower your risk by diversifying, or investing in lots of different stocks. That means investing in a mutual fund or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Mutual funds, offer diversification, which can help spread risk. Index-based mutual funds invest in a broad range of securities including both stocks and bonds. I would recommend sticking to mutual funds and saving accounts for most investors.\n|user|: What are ETFs?\n|assistant|: An ETF is an \"\"Exchange Traded Fund\"\". It trades like a stock, on the stock market. Basically by buying one ETF, you can have ownership in the underlying companies that make up the ETF. An ETF does not track any one individual stock. It is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. ETFs can be a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a broad portfolio of investments. Like mutual funds, ETFs can offer diversification, which can help spread risk. However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs have a higher liquidity and they can be traded at any time during the trading hours.\n|user|: How much money do I need to invest in mutual funds or ETFs\n|assistant|: The minimum investment for mutual funds can vary depending on the fund, but it is often around $2000. However, $5000 isn't enough to give you much flexibility in achieving a balanced portfolio. For ETFs, you can invest in funds with a minimum amount subject to the fund's requirements. Keep in mind that buying and selling ETFs will cost you a commission, typically around 2-3% of your investment. When investing small amounts, you should consider the substantial toll that commissions will take on your investment. It is recommended to have at least $5000 to invest in stocks or ETFs to minimize the impact of commissions. If you have a smaller amount to invest, you might consider a Vanguard mutual fund, which will not charge commissions and will have annual expenses only slightly higher than the corresponding ETF.\n|user|: How long is \"long term investing\"?\n|assistant|: Staying invested in stock market over the long term will almost always be profitable if you spread your investments across different companies or even the index but the key here is long term which is 10+ years. Long term data shows 40 years worth of investing put the investor far ahead. Even a retiree is still a long term investor as life spans of 90 are common. The concept of \"long-term investing\" can vary depending on the context and the individual investor's financial goals. Generally, 5 years is a reasonable time period to invest in a stock.\n|user|: When do I have to start saving for my retirement?"

        "text": "\n\"There's already an excellent answer here from @BenMiller, but I wanted to expand a bit on Types of Investments with some additional actionable information. You can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds (which are simply   collections of stocks and bonds), bank accounts, precious metals, and   many other things. Discussing all of these investments in one answer   is too broad, but my recommendation is this: If you are investing for   retirement, you should be investing in the stock market. However,   picking individual stocks is too risky; you need to be diversified in   a lot of stocks. Stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the   stock market. So how does one go about actually investing in the stock market in a diversified way? What if you also want to diversify a bit into bonds? Fortunately, in the last several years, several products have come about that do just these things, and are targeted towards newer investors. These are often labeled \"\"robo-advisors\"\". Most even allow you to adjust your allocation according to your risk preferences. Here's a list of the ones I know about: While these products all purport to achieve similar goals of giving you an easy way to obtain a diversified portfolio according to your risk, they differ in the buckets of stocks and funds they put your money into; the careful investor would be wise to compare which specific ETFs they use (e.g. looking at their expense ratios, capitalization, and spreads).\"",

        "text": "\n\"This depends strongly on what you mean by \"\"stock trading\"\". It isn't a single game, but a huge number of games grouped under a single name. You can invest in individual stocks. If you're willing to make the (large) effort needed to research the companies and their current position and potentialities, this can yield large returns at high risk, or moderate returns at moderate risk. You need to diversify across multiple stocks, and multiple kinds of stocks (and probably bonds and other investment vehicles as well) to manage that risk. Or you can invest in managed mutual funds, where someone picks and balances the stocks for you. They charge a fee for that service, which has to be subtracted from their stated returns. You need to decide how much you trust them. You will usually need to diversify across multiple funds to get the balance of risk you're looking for, with a few exceptions like Target Date funds. Or you can invest in index funds, which automate the stock-picking process to take a wide view of the market and count on the fact that, over time, the market as a whole moves upward. These may not produce the same returns on paper, but their fees are MUCH lower -- enough so that the actual returns to the investor can be as good as, or better than, managed funds. The same point about diversification remains true, with the same exceptions. Or you can invest in a mixture of these, plus bonds and other investment vehicles, to suit your own level of confidence in your abilities, confidence in the market as a whole, risk tolerance, and so on. Having said all that, there's also a huge difference between \"\"trading\"\" and \"\"investing\"\", at least as I use the terms. Stock trading on a short-term basis is much closer to pure gambling -- unless you do the work to deeply research the stocks in question so you know their value better than other people do, and you're playing against pros. You know the rule about poker: If you look around the table and don't see the sucker, he's sitting in your seat... well, that's true to some degree in short-term trading too.",

Unfortunately some employer matching programs discourage you from putting in too much.  I've been able to max out the 401k contribution a number of times, which helps. Remember:  you are likely to live to 100, so you better save enough to live that long.  I don't trust social security to be there.

The basic idea is to invest a large chunk of your income and establish your comfort level balancing frugality and comfort.  There's a table on one of the FIRE websites that shows a graph between % of income saved and the number of years it takes to save enough to be financially independent.

In this case, financially independent is where you can live on a safe percentage of withdrawal from your savings without depleting the savings.

Ideally, you should start saving for retirement in your 20s or as soon as you start earning a steady income. However, it's never too late to start saving for retirement, and any amount of savings is better than none. It's also important to regularly review and adjust your retirement savings plan as your financial situation and goals change over time."
