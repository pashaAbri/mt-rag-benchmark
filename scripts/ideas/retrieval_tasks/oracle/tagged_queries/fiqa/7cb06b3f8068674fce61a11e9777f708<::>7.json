    "text": "Credit scores have a huge financial impact on your life and that is why it is very important to establish a good one. For instance with a decent credit score, increase your chance to get loans . Some insurance companies can even use it to some extent to determine your rates. Additionally having a good credit score demonstrates your ability to repay borrowed funds. Everything stems from that goal; available credit, payment history, collections, etc. all serve to demonstrate whether or not you personally are a good investment for lenders to pursue. ",

        "text": "\n\"It all comes down to how the loan itself is structured and reported - the exact details of how they run the loan paperwork, and how/if they report the activity on the loan to one of the credit bureaus (and which one they report to). It can go generally one of three ways: A) The loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. In this scenario, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially this will generally drop related credit scores somewhat (it's a \"\"hard pull\"\", new account with zero history, and increased debt), but over time this can have a positive effect on both people's credit rating. This is the typical scenario one might logically expect to be the norm, and it effects both parties credit just as if they were a sole signor for the loan. And as always, if the loan is not paid properly it will negatively effect both people's credit, and the owner of the loan can choose to come after either or both parties in whatever order they want. B) The loan company just runs the loan with one person, and only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the co-signor), leaving the other as just a backup. If you aren't paying close attention they may even arrange it where the initial party wanting to take the loan isn't even on most of the paperwork. This let the person trying to run the loan get something accepted that might not have been otherwise, or save some time, or was just an error. In this case it will have no effect on Person A's credit. We've had a number of question like this, and this isn't really a rare occurrence. Never assume people selling you things are necessarily accurate or honest - always verify. C) The loan company just doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, or does so incorrectly. They are under no obligation to report to credit agencies, it's strictly up to them. If you don't pay then they can report it as something \"\"in collections\"\".",

However a loan with a cosigner can bring a lot problems. In the first scenario, if the loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner, then both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially, this might decrease related credit scores slightly due to a hard pull, new account with zero history, and increased debt. However, over time, it can have a positive effect on both people's credit ratings if the loan is paid properly. Conversely, if the loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect both people's credit. In the second scenario, if the loan company only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the cosigner), leaving the other as just a backup, it will have no effect on the borrower's credit. In the third scenario, if the loan company doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, there will be no direct impact on the borrower's credit. However, if the loan goes into collections and is reported as such, it would negatively affect the borrower's credit. Nevertheless a cosigner will make sure you are going to make every single payment on time because otherwise he will be responsible to pay it  .                                    \n|user|: I see, that means if the person does not ot pay his/her loand, the cosigner will be responsability to do it right and how does this work?\n|assistant|: Yes, that's right. The co-signer is responsible for the loan just as much as borrower is. In fact if the borrower does not pay, the co-signer is liable for making the payments. When you co-sign a loan, you are essentially saying \"\"I will pay this loan if the other person can't.\"\"\" The cos-signer is 100% liable if for any reason you can't or won't pay. Also this shows up on a credit report just like it's your debt. This limits the amount you can borrow for any reason.\n|user|: It is better never be a co-signer.\n|assistant|: Actually being a cosigner for a loan involves significant responsibilities. It is the same as borrowing the money in your name and giving it right over to the borrower. Before accept be a cosigner, think it, you're just as responsible for the loan payments as the original borrower, and given that you were a useful co-signer, probably much more likely to be able to come up with the money.  If you can't pay, the lender comes after both of you  if the bank is asking for a co-signer its because they are not very confident that the applicant is going to be paying back the loan.Never co-sign a loan for someone, especially family .Taking out a loan for yourself is bad enough, but co-signing a loan is just plain stupid.  Besides, co-signer can become enraged if the original borrower does not pay the loan. As I mentioned before, be careful. Make sure you are willing to take the risk because you are promising the bank that you will make any payments that the borrower would not make it.\n|user|: credit rating/credit score\n|assistant|: First of all it is very important to understand what a credit score or credit rating is. It has a huge financial impact on consumers, even though most people don’t know how they are calculated or which bad habits may be driving theirs down. Your credit score is a number on a scale of 300 to 900 that can affect all of your financial decisions, from shopping for groceries to applying for a mortgage.  A credit score is your history of accruing debt and paying it back. It is supplemented by your age, time at current residence, time at previous residences, time at your job.  Additionally, your crediting rating is also way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts, not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full. There is a scale that it is considered s have a huge financial impact on consumers, even though most people don’t know how they are calculated or which bad habits may be driving theirs down. Your credit score is a number on a scale of 300 to 900 that can affect all of your financial decisions, from shopping for groceries to applying for a mortgage. There is also a credit scale considered as ambiguous but they are  : AAA, AA, A, BBB, BBB-, BB+, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, D.\n|user|: FICO?\n|assistant|: FICO is financial services company, whose customers are financial services companies. The purpose of the credit score system is two-fold. First, the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions (FICO's customers) to assess the risk of loans that they make.  The second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money. FICO scoring prefers to see a large number of accounts, low utilization, high average account age, low number of inquiries, no late payment.A credit card can be a long running line of credit that will help to boost your FICO score. However if you have student loans, a mortgage, or car payments those will work just as well.  FICO that stands for Fair Isaac Corporation uses information from the 3 major credit bureaus   Equifax, Transunion and Experian. It is important to note that FICO score tracks credit not checking or savings.\n|user|: raise my credit card score\n|assistant|: Good credit is calculated (by many lenders) by taking your FICO score which is calculated based upon what is in your credit report. Building credit generally means building up your FICO score. Your FICO score is impacted my many factors, one small one of which is your utilization ratio of your installment loans like student loans. This is the ratio of the current balance to your original balance. To improve your score (slightly) you would want a lower ratio.You can use some services  that specifically help you boost your credit card score as , boostcredit101.com .They add you as an authorized user to a credit card with a high limit, low balance, and perfect payment history. This \"\"boosts\"\" for about 30 days while you remain listed as a user on that account, which allows you to qualify for your own card or other kind of loan in that time and helps you start rebuilding your credit. You also can build a better credit by aving more credit available. So by increasing your credit limit, its lowering your credit utilization rate (one of the factors that go into your credit score) - which is a good thing. So your bank trusts you with more credit, which again is a good thing. You can also request a line of credit increase yourself without waiting for the bank to do so - but there's a 6 month wait between each increase, assuming you get one. In fact to boost your score,  use your credit card regularly and also repay  your bills on time. This will help increase your credit score. \n|user|: Why is it so important to have a good credit scores. that is so stressful ."

However, your family member will need to take into consideration if they are willing to be responsible for the loan in the event you are unable to make payments. Being a co-signer means they are agreeing to pay the loan amount. It will also impact their credit score/report, either improve it if all goes well, or destroy it if neither one of you are able to pay the loan. So to you, assuming you can pay all the payments and not default, it makes no difference.

It is supplemented by your age, time at current residence, time at previous residences, time at your job, etc. A person with zero debt history can still have a decent score - provided they are well established, a little older and have a good job.  The top scores are reserved for those that manage what creditors consider an \"\"appropriate\"\" amount of debt and are well established.  In other words, you're good with money and likely have long term roots in the community.  After all, creditors don't normally like being the first one you try out... Being young and having recently moved you are basically a \"\"flight risk\"\".  Meaning someone who is more likely to just pick up and move when the debt becomes too much. So, you have a couple options.  The first is to simply wait.  Keep going to work, keep living where you are, etc.  As you establish yourself you become less of a risk.   The second is to start incurring debt.  Personally, I am not a fan of this one.  Some people do well by getting a small credit card, using some portion of it each month and paying it off immediately.  Others don't know how to control that very well and end up having a few months where they roll balances over etc which becomes a trap that costs them far more than before. If I were in your position, I'd likely do one of two things.  Either buy the phone outright and sign up for a regular mobile plan OR take the cheaper phone for a couple years.\"",

Everything stems from that goal; available credit, payment history, collections, etc all serve to demonstrate whether or not you personally are a good investment for lenders to pursue. Revolving credit balances are tricky because they are more complicated than fixed loans (for the rest of this answer, I'll just talk about credit cards, though it also applies to lines of credit such as overdraft protection for checking accounts, HELOCs, and other such products). Having a large available balance relative to your income means that at any time you could suddenly drown yourself in debt.  Having no credit cards means you don't have experience managing them (and personal finances are governed largely by behavior, meaning experience is invaluable).  Having credit cards but carrying a high balance means you know how to borrow money, but not pay it back.  Having credit cards but carrying no balance means you don't know how to borrow money (or you don't trust yourself to pay it back). Ideally, lenders will see a pattern of you borrowing a portion of the available credit, and then paying it down.  Generally that means utilizing up to 30% of your available credit.  Even if you maintain the balance in that range without paying it off completely, it at least shows that you have restraint, and are able to stop spending at a limit you personally set, rather than the limit the bank sets for you. So, to answer your question, 0% balance on your credit cards is bad because you might as well not have them.  Use it, pay it off, rinse and repeat, and it will demonstrate your ability to exercise self control as well as your ability to repay your debts.",

    "original_text": "Having a good credit score is important because it can significantly impact various financial aspects of your life. Lenders often use credit scores to determine the risk associated with lending money, which can affect the interest rates and terms of loans. A higher credit score can lead to better loan offers, including lower interest rates and more favorable terms. On the other hand, a lower credit score may result in higher interest rates, less favorable terms, or even denial of credit.\nAdditionally, credit scores can influence other financial decisions, such as renting an apartment or obtaining insurance. Landlords and insurance companies may use credit scores to assess the reliability and financial responsibility of applicants. A good credit score can increase the likelihood of approval and access to better rates and terms.\nWhile maintaining a good credit score can be stressful, understanding the factors that contribute to your credit score and practicing good financial habits can help alleviate some of this stress. Paying bills on time, maintaining low balances on credit cards, and limiting new credit inquiries are some ways to maintain and improve your credit score."
