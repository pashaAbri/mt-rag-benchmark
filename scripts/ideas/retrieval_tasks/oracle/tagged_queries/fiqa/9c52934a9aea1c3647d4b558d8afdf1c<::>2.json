There is also a risk that if the startup succeeds, the financial rewards may not be evenly distributed among employees. Additionally, startups often require long working hours and high levels of responsibility, and there may be a risk of job security as the company grows and hires new employees.",

You know why we worship the successes?  Because against all odds, those startups stood up to your salaried buddies who work for faceless large corporations and have tons of people and kicked their asses.  At some point, they deserve it.  You see startups as gambling, others see it as betting on yourself.  Especially founding or joining an early stage startup.  It's also taking on huge responsibility.  In a mega-corp your failures and shortcomings will be covered and almost certainly won't tank the company.  Your creativity probably won't flourish and their is an incentive to do just well enough.  Why should you work your ass off for a company that you're not invested in other than a paycheck?  Startups aren't for everyone.  Hell, startups probably aren't for most people.  But there are some people, those select few, who simply can't imagine not working for themselves, creating things, tinkering, trying to change the world.  It's not even gambling to them, it's a way of life.",

This is the inherent risk of a start-up, so there's no getting around the fact that there's a chance that the business may fail and your shares become worthless. Up to you if you think the risk is acceptable. Where you can mitigate risk is in ensuring that there's a well-written and enforceable set of documents that define what rights go with the shares, who controls the company, how profits will be distributed, etc. Don't do this by spoken agreement only. Get it all written down, and then get it checked by a lawyer representing your interests.",

A startup is a good way to spend a good chunk of a decade working very long weeks, only to get shoved into a back room or laid off once they reach a certain size. Maybe if you're lucky you'll manage to stick around and have a bigger paycheck than most of your newly-hired peers. Maybe you'll even make most of what your new boss(es) that have been there a fifth as long as you and never pulled those 110 hour workweeks make. Of course, it's quite possible that simply working a second job during the time you were pulling mad hours and not getting OT for it would've made you just as much.  On the other hand, if you're talking about your own startup? Sure, go for it. If it all works out, those extra hours will be well compensated in the future.",
