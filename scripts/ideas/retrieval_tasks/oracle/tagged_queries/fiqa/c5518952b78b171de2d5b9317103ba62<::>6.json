For example, one gets a direct deposit totaling the sum of regular monthly bills and a prorated provision for longer term regular bills like semi-annual car insurance premiums; and the other one gets a direct deposit of the rest which I then allocate to savings and spending. For another example, use account B for all my expenses (rent, credit card, food, etc) and use account A to save money.",

One gets a direct deposit totaling the sum of my regular monthly bills and a prorated provision for longer term regular bills like semi-annual car insurance premiums.  I leave a buffer in the account to account for the odd expensive electrical bill or rate increase or whatever.  One gets a direct deposit of the rest which I then allocate to savings and spending. It makes sense to me to separate off regular planned expenses (rent/mortgage, utility bills, insurance premiums) from spending money because it lets me put the basics of my life on autopilot.  An added benefit is I have a failover checking account in the event something happens to one of them.  I don't keep significant amounts of money in either account and don't give transfer access to the savings accounts that store the bulk of my money.  I wear a tinfoil hat when it comes to automatic bank transfers and account access... It doesn't make sense to me to keep deposits separate from spending, it makes less sense to me to spend off of a savings account.",

I asked my employer to send my salary into account A. Furthermore I have configured an automatic transfer of money from account A to account B on the first of each month.  I only use account B for all my expenses (rent, credit card, food, etc) and I check its statement quite often. Since the monthly transfer is only 80% of my salary I save money each month in account A. I don't have a credit card attached to the savings account and I almost never look at its statement. Since that money is out of sight, I do not think much about it and I do not think that I could spend it. I know it is a cheap trick, but it works pretty well for me.",

This approach can help with budgeting and saving, as well as provide a backup account in case of any issues with the primary account. In the documents provided, one individual uses two accounts to separate their regular planned expenses from their spending money, while another uses two accounts to automatically transfer a portion of their salary to savings, making it \"out of sight\" and less likely to be spent. Overall, using two bank accounts can be a useful financial strategy."
