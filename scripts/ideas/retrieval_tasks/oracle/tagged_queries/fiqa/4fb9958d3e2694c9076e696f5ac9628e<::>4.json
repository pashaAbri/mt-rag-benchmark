However if you are asking about the process of registering business , it is done  accordingly to the state and the most essential thing for incorporating business is to create extra tax burden and keep record of the business with administrative details.  But if you are talking about VAT, you can do regardless of the nature or size of the business. Moreover if you do business under your name, you don't need to register your business. Your business will be treated as a sole proprietorship.

Credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule C (or whatever form you're using to report business income and expenses). If you are using the same card for both business and personal ... well, for starters, this is a very bad idea, because it creates exactly the question you're asking. If that's what you're doing, stop, and get separate business and personal cards. If you have separate business and personal cards -- and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses -- then the answer is easy: You can claim a schedule C deduction for any service charges on the business card, and you cannot claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card. In general, though, if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal, you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business, and that is deductible. In an admittedly brief search, I couldn't find anything specifically about credit cards, but I did find this similar idea on the IRS web site: Generally, you cannot deduct personal, living, or family expenses. However, if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes, divide the total cost between the business and personal parts. You can deduct the business part. For example, if you borrow money and use 70% of it for business and the other 30% for a family vacation, you can deduct 70% of the interest as a business expense. The remaining 30% is personal interest and is not deductible. Refer to chapter 4 of Publication 535, Business Expenses, for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules. (https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deducting-business-expenses) So, PROBABLY, you could add up all the charges you made on the card, figure out how much was for business and how much for personal, calculate the business percentage, and then deduct this percentage of the service fees. If the amount involved is not trivial, you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer.",

        "text": "\n\"For simplicity, let's start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable (sort of, I'll explain later). The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs $100 and you receive $2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid $98 for that item but that wouldn't affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same $100 deduction would have only been a $98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the $2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that $2 as income though; that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions: Part 1: As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counter-acted by the \"\"refund\"\" you receive for the payments. Part 2: Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards/points/cashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a \"\"don't ask, don't tell\"\" rule that the IRS is OK with.",

You can usually check the availability of a name by searching the database of your state's Secretary of State or similar agency.\n2. Choose a business structure. The most common structures are Sole Proprietorship, Partnership, Corporation, and Limited Liability Company (LLC). Each structure has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to choose the one that best fits your needs.\n3. Obtain any necessary licenses and permits. The requirements for these vary depending on the type of business you are starting and the location. You can usually find information about these requirements on the website of your city, county, or state government.\n4. Register your business with the appropriate government agency. In most cases, this will be the Secretary of State or similar agency in your state. You will need to provide some basic information about your business, such as its name, address, and the names of its owners or officers.\n5. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. This is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and it is used to identify your business for tax purposes.\n6. Set up a system for keeping track of your business's finances. This can include opening a separate bank account for your business, setting up a bookkeeping system, and creating a budget.\nIt's important to note that the specific requirements for registering a business can vary depending on your location and the type of business you are starting. It's always a good idea to consult with a business advisor or attorney to make sure you are meeting all the necessary legal requirements."
