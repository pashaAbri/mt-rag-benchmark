    "text": "Bond yield quotes provide important information about a bond's yield, which is the annualized return on investment for the bond. Here's how to read bond yield quotes:\n* Time: This refers to the time of the quote presented and indicates when the quote was generated.\n* Coupon (coupon rate): This is the amount of interest paid on the bond each period, as specified on the coupon itself. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the bond's face value.\n* Price: This is the normalised price of the bond, representing the price of taking a position of $100 worth of the principal in the bond. It is often expressed as a percentage of the bond's face value.\n* Yield: This is the interest rate that you would receive by buying at the current price. It is the inverse of the price and represents the annualized return on investment for the bond.\nTo summarize, when reading bond yield quotes, the time refers to the quote's generation time, while the coupon, price, and yield provide information about the bond's interest payments, market value, and annualized return on investment, respectively.",

        "text": "\n\"Like all financial investments, the value of a bond is the present value of expected future cash flows.  The Yield to Maturity is the annualized return you get on your initial investment, which is equivalent to the discount rate you'd use to discount future cash flows. So if you discount all future cashflows at 6% annually*, you can calculate the price of the bond: So the price of a $1,000 bond (which is how bond prices are typically quoted) would be $1,097.12. The current yield is just the current coupon payment divided by the current price, which is 70/1,097.12 or 6.38% Question 3 makes no sense, since the yield to maturity would be the same if you bought the bond at market price Question 4 talks about a \"\"sale\"\" date which makes me think that it assumes you sold the bond on the coupon date, but you'd have to know the sale price to calculate the rate of return.\"",

        "text": "\nImagine that the existing interest rate is 5%. So on a bond with face value of 100, you would be getting a $5 coupon implying a 5% yield. Now, if let's say the interest rates go up to 10%, then a new bond issued with a face value of 100 will give you a coupon of $10 implying a 10% yield. If someone in the bond market buys your bond after interest price adjustment, in order to make the 10% yield (which means that an investor typically targets at least the risk-free rate on his investments) he needs to buy your bond at $50 so that a $5 coupon can give a 10% yield. The reverse happens when interest rates go down. I hope this somewhat clears the picture. Yield = Coupon/Investment Amount Update: Since the interest rate of the bond does not change after its issuance, the arbitrage in the interest rate is reflected in the market price of the bond. This helps in bringing back the yields of old bonds in-line with the freshly issued bonds.",
