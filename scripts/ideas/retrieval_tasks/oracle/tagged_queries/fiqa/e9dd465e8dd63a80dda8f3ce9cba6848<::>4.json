    "text": "Calculating a company's enterprise value requires considering several factors. The equation for enterprise value is as follows: EV = Market Cap + Minority Interest + Preferred Stock + Debt—Cash. Enterprise value represents the total value of a company to all its shareholders, including creditors, preferred stockholders, and common stockholders. It's important to note that taking on debt can either increase or decrease the enterprise value, depending on the company's cash balance.",

        "text": "\nRight, I understand minority interest but it is typically reported as a positive under liabilities instead of a negative. For example, when you are calculating the enterprise value of a company, you add back in the minority interest.    Enterprise Value= Market Share +Pref Equity + Min Interest+ Total Debt - Cash and ST Equivalents.    EV is used to quantify the total price of a company's worth. If you have negative Min Interest on your books, that will make your EV less than it should be, creating an incorrect valuation.   This just doesn't make any sense to me. Does it mean that the subsidiary that they had a stake in had a negative earning?",

The equation:   EV = Market Cap + Minority Interest + Preferred Stock + Debt - Cash  Enterprise Value is the value of the company to ALL shareholders (creditors, preferred stock holders, common stock holders).  So, taking on debt could either increase or decrease the EV depending on the cash balance of the company.  This will have no effect, directly, on the market cap. It will, however effect the present value of its future cash flows as the WACC will increase due to the new cost of debt (interest payments, higher risk of bankruptcy, less flexibility by management).",
