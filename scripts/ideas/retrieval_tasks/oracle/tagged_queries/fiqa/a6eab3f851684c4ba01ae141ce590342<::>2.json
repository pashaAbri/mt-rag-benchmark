        "text": "\n\"1040 or 1040NR depends on whether you are a resident alien or nonresident alien -- 1040/1040A/1040EZ for resident aliens, and 1040NR/1040NR-EZ for nonresident aliens. Determining whether you are a resident is somewhat complex, and there is not enough information in your question to determine it. Publication 519 is the guide for taxes for aliens. (It hasn't been updated for 2014 yet, so mentally shift all the years in the publication up by one year when you read it.) Since you don't have a green card, whether you are a resident is determined by the Substantial Presence Test. The test says that if (the number of days you were in the U.S. in 2014) + 1/3 of (the number of days you were in the U.S. in 2013) + 1/6 of (the number of days you were in the U.S. in 2012) >= 183 days (half a year), then you are a resident alien for 2014. However, there are exceptions to the test. Days that you are an \"\"exempt individual\"\" are not counted toward the Substantial Presence Test. And \"\"exempt individuals\"\" include international students, trainees, teachers, etc. However, there are exceptions to the exceptions. Students are not \"\"exempt individuals\"\" for a year if they have been exempt individuals for any part of 5 previous calendar years. (Different exceptions apply for teachers and trainees.) So whether you are an \"\"exempt individual\"\" for one year inductively depends on whether you have been an \"\"exempt individual\"\" in previous years. Long story short, if before you came to the U.S. as an F-1 student, you haven't been in the U.S. on F-1 or J-1 status, then you will be a nonresident alien for the first 5 calendar years (calendar year = year with a number, not 365 days) that you've been on F-1. We will assume this is the case below.",

However, if you are considered a non-resident alien for tax purposes, which is typical for F-1 students, you would need to file Form 1040NR and account for any profit made on dividends/capital gain when doing your US taxes. It's important to note that a software package provided by your university for doing taxes might not be adequate for this, so you may need to seek additional resources.\n|user|: Can I not use the 1040NR-EZ?"

    "original_text": "Based on the information provided, it seems that you would not be able to use Form 1040NR-EZ. This form is for nonresident aliens who had no dependents, earned only certain types of income, and did not claim any deductions or credits other than the standard deduction. If you have profits from investing in foreign markets, you would likely need to itemize these deductions, which is not possible with Form 1040NR-EZ. Therefore, you would most likely need to use the regular Form 1040NR. However, I would recommend consulting the instructions for these forms or a tax professional to ensure you are filing correctly."
