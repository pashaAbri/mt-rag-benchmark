I wouldn't be surprising to see EVs take a significant share of the auto market in the coming years (they were ~1% in 2016).  Innovation drives economic growth.  It's also good for the environment (the electricity used is much cleaner than gasoline/diesel) and electrical grid (increased demand that's potentially responsive to system load helps finance smart grid improvements).",

If an EV's battery is not expected to last long, it may negatively impact its resale value. However, major car manufacturers like Toyota, GM, and Nissan have conducted extensive research and testing to ensure the durability of their battery packs. While some companies have had success, others like Nissan have faced heat-related issues due to the lack of a liquid cooling system. Overall, enhanced battery technology is needed to improve the lifespan of EV batteries and their impact on the used car market."
