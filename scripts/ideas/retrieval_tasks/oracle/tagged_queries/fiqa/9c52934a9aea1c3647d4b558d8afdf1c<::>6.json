I agree with all of your points about the upside of working for small companies. Some of the upsides I find at the big company where I work are:  - there are people around you that know more than you do. There is a huge opportunity to learn from them, which is a lot harder when you're the lone expert at a 5-person company (you rely on whatever you can scrape up from the internet, etc.). Most people learn faster with good mentoring.  - there is money to spend on things that you need. No raised eyebrows from the CEO when you say that you need a $20 lamp for your desk, or even more serious issues like adequate hardware for what you need to do, getting tools you need, etc. (Less of an issue at a VC-funded startup, until the money starts running low.)  - there are entire teams that help with things like documentation, customer support, sales, tools, and other things, which frees me up to do what I'm good at, which is making software.  I remember reading some advice a while ago that still rings true to me, which is that there isn't a single \"\"right\"\" place to work (small/large, etc.); the right thing to do is get experience with a variety of different environments - in the end you'll be stronger for it.\"",

        "text": "\n\"I still think this tech boom is different. The 2000 boom/bust was so much based around a fiction. Namely, the infrastructure and logistics. The country was not yet set up for streaming services or online retail, the main drivers of that boom/bust. Today, broadband is ubiquitous, there's a computer in every home, and a smartphone in every pocket. Big data and automation drives vastly more efficient logistics, with the only main obstacle still yet to be worked out is AI that will allow companies like Uber and Tesla to realize their valuations. And the main drivers of tech are the so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Netflix), as well as other tech like Microsoft and Cisco. What's the difference between these and, say, Pets.com or HotBot? *These are real companies.* Pets.com went boom to bust in less than a year. Broadcast.com sold for $5+billion...in 1999 (u kidin me?) Today's \"\"overvalued\"\" stocks have product, customers, business models and strategies in place. And the infrastructure they depend on actually exists.\"",

FAANG companies offer stability, resources, and a well-established brand, while startups offer the opportunity to be part of something new and potentially impactful, as well as the chance to gain a wider range of experience and responsibilities. However, startups also come with a higher level of risk.\nIn terms of financial rewards, FAANG companies typically offer competitive salaries and benefits packages, while startups may offer equity in the company as a form of compensation. However, the distribution of financial rewards at a startup is not guaranteed and may not be evenly distributed among employees.\nUltimately, the decision of where to work comes down to your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and career aspirations. It may be helpful to consider factors such as the industry you are interested in, the type of work environment you prefer, and the opportunities for growth and development."
