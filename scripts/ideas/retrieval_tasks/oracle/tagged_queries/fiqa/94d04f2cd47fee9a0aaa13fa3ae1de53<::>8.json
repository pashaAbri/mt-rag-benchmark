    "text": "A financial advisor is a professional service provider who can handle tasks that you either don't have time for or prefer someone else to manage. If you lack the time or interest to manage your investments, hiring a financial advisor is a good idea. It's generally better to work with an advisor who charges an annual fee based on a percentage of your account value rather than one who gets paid based on transactions. Advisors compensated in the latter way may have a vested interest in making frequent changes to your account, which might not be in your best interest. It's important to be cautious of advisors who promote expensive mutual funds with sales loads or annuities. Additionally, your advisor's compensation structure should be transparent.",

It is his/her job to do things for you that you could do for yourself, but you're either too busy to do it yourself (and you want to pay somebody else), or you'd rather not. Just like some people hire tax preparers, or maids, or people to change their oil, or re-roof their houses. Me, I choose to self-manage.  I get some advise from Fidelity and Vanguard.  But we hired somebody this year to re-roof our house and someone else to paint it.",

    "original_text": "Based on the information provided, here's a general advice:\nWhen considering purchasing a business, it's important to thoroughly research and explore multiple options. Set clear goals, work with trustworthy professionals, and establish a budget. Understanding the business and the metrics associated with its stock is also crucial.\nRegarding the control of a company, purchasing a significant portion of the shares may allow you to control the company, but it depends on various factors such as the company's structure and the types of shares outstanding.\nAs for the value of a stock, it's determined by the price people are willing to pay for it. Different economic theories have different views on the determination of value.\nIn terms of decision-making in business, it's driven by the pursuit of profit. Business owners must constantly re-evaluate the current and future climate. While goodwill and good intentions are important, they do not always equate to positive results.\nEmployees are a vital part of a business. As the company grows, it's important to keep adding people in layers and ensuring they feel part of something more than just a job.\nThe decision to sell a business depends on various factors such as the profitability of the business, your interest in expanding it, the alignment of the stock with your strategy, and the demand for the industry in which the business operates."
