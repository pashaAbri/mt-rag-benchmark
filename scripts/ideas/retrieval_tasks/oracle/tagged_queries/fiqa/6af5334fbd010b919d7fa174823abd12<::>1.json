Your arrangement with your parents is certainly material to you getting another  loan.  The mortgage application will probably require you to disclose all outstanding debt.  Obviously, if you choose to omit it and your parents don't tell, it probably won't come up.  But that would be unethical (definitely) and illegal (probably).   Whether this will interfere with you getting a loan is another question, but since it's your only debt it will probably be OK.",

    "original_text": "Based on the information provided, a mortgage is a type of loan used to purchase a house. It seems that the documents do not directly address whether a mortgage can cover other outstanding debts. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question. However, it is important to note that when applying for a mortgage, you are typically required to disclose all outstanding debts. This includes debts to parents, banks, money lenders, phone companies, and any other creditors. Failure to disclose such debts could be considered unethical and potentially illegal."
