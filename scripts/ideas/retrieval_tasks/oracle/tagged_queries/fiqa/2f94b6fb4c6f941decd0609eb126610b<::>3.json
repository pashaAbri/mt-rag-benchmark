    "text": "IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account. It's a type of retirement account where you can delay paying taxes now on your deposits or avoid paying taxes on your earnings later. You can set up a personal IRA for yourself, but not for employees. The investments within an IRA can vary - you can invest in certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or any mix of these. The taxation of an IRA is similar to a 401k, where contributions are made with pre-tax dollars and withdrawals are taxed upon retirement.",

        "text": "\nFirst of all, there are some differences between the retirement accounts that you mentioned regarding taxes. Traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts allow you to make pre-tax contributions, giving you an immediate tax deduction when you contribute. Roth IRA, Roth 401(k) are funded with after tax money, and a non-retirement account is, of course, also funded with after tax money. So if you are looking for the immediate tax deduction, this is a point in favor of the retirement accounts. Roth IRA & Roth 401(k) accounts allow the investment to grow tax-free, which means that the growth is not taxed, even when taking the investment out at retirement. With Traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts, you need to pay tax on the gains realized in the account when you withdraw the money, just as you do with a non-retirement account. This is a point in favor of the Roth retirement accounts. To answer your question about capital gains, yes, it is true that you do not have a capital gain until an investment is sold. So, discounting the contribution tax deductions of the retirement accounts, if you only bought individual stocks that never paid a dividend, and never sold them until retirement, you are correct that it really wouldn't matter if you had it in a regular brokerage account or in a traditional IRA. However, even people dedicated to buy-and-hold rarely actually buy only individual stocks and hold them for 30 years. There are several different circumstances that will generally happen in the time between now and when you want to withdraw the money in retirement that would be taxable events if you are not in a retirement account: If you sell an investment and buy a different one, the gains would be taxable. If you want to rebalance your holdings, this also involves selling a portion of your investments. For example, if you want to maintain an 80% stock/20% bond ratio, and your stock values have gone up to 90%, you might want to sell some stock and buy bonds. Or if you are getting closer to retirement, you might decide to go with a higher percentage of bonds. This would trigger capital gains. Inside a mutual fund, anytime the management sells investments inside the fund and realizes capital gains, these gains are passed on to the investors, and are taxable.",

                    "model_text": "|user|: how to balance 401k?\n|assistant|: Balancing a 401k involves reallocating and rebalancing the investments within the account. You should determine the overall allocation between bonds, stocks, international, REIT, etc. This will depend on your risk tolerances and the total money in your 401k and IRA.  Once you figure out the allocation, map the available funds in your 401k according to this allocation. It is important to rebalance your 401k every year to maintain your desired asset allocation. Additionally you should review your allocation in a few years or after a life event such as a change of job, getting married, having kids, or buying a house. You can move from investment X to investment Y within your 401k without tax consequences. \n|user|: How is 401k account taxed?\n|assistant|: 401(k) contributions are pre-tax dollars. A 401k account is taxed when you withdraw the money upon retirement. This is similar to how an IRA is taxed. The idea behind this is that you will likely be in a lower tax bracket at the time of retirement. It's important to note that 401k contributions reduce your taxable income for each paycheck, but they do not impact the level of your social security and medicare taxes. Also, the employer match is considered free money.\n|user|: What do you mean by IRA?"

        "text": "\nOK, so first of all, employers don't set up IRAs.  IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account.  You can set up a personal IRA for yourself, but not for employees.  If that is what you're after, then just set one up for yourself - no special rules there for self employment. As far as setting up a 401(k), I'd suggest checking with benefits management companies.  If you're small, you probably don't have an HR department, so managing a 401(k) yourself would likely be overly burdensome.  Outsourcing this to a company which handles HR for you (maybe running payroll, etc. also), would be the best option.  Barring that, I'd try calling a large financial institution (Schwab, Fidelity, etc.) for clear guidance.",

        "text": "\nA 401K (pre-tax or Roth) account or an IRA (Deductible or Roth) account is a retirement account. Which means you delay paying taxes now on your deposits, or you avoid paying taxes on your earnings later.  But a retirement account doesn't  perform any different than any other account year-to-year. Being a retirement account doesn't  dictate a type of investment. You can invest in a certificate of deposit that is guaranteed to make x% this year; or you can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds that infest in stocks or bonds. Those stocks and bonds can be growth focused, or income focused; they can be from large companies or small companies; US companies or international companies. Or whatever mix you want. The graph in your question shows that if you invest early in your adulthood, and keep investing, and you make the average return you should make more money than starting later. But a couple of notes:  So to your exact questions: An S&P 500 investment should perform exactly the same this year if it is in a 401K, IRA, or taxable account With a few exceptions:  Yes any investment can lose money. The last 6 months have been volatile and the last month and a half especially so. A retirement account isn't any different. An investment in mutual fund X in a retirement account is just as depressed a one in the same fund but from a taxable account.",
