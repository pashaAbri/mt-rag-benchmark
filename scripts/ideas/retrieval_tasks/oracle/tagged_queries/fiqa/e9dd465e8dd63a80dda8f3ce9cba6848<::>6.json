People always talk about WACC, but in reality, WACC is less important than figuring how how much debt a Company can support (determined by leverage and solvency statistics).  Here are a few things to think about:  -How stable are the Company's cash flows? (big difference between a Company that has multi-year contracts locked in place vs. variable/cyclical revenue streams; what type of Capex requirement is there?)  -What is the purpose of raising the capital? (growth vs. recapitalization; where are the proceeds going?)  -What collateral is available for creditors?  -What does working capital look like? (is there seasonality?)",

    "original_text": "The reliability of the WACC formula depends on the accuracy of the inputs and assumptions used in the calculation. These inputs include the cost of equity, cost of debt, corporate tax rate, and the market value weights of each capital component. If these inputs are estimated accurately, the WACC formula can provide a useful measure of a company's cost of capital. However, if there are errors or biases in the input estimates, the WACC calculation may be less reliable. Therefore, it's essential to use conservative and well-researched estimates when calculating the WACC."
