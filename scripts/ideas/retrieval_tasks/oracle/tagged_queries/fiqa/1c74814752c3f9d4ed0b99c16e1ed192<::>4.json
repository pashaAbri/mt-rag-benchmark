In 2015, the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $12,600, and each person gets a personal exemption of $4,000. If your deductions exceed the standard deduction, you can subtract property taxes from your income. For example, if your income is $95,000, after taking into account the standard deduction of $12,600 and $8,000 in exemptions, your taxable income would be just under $10,000, unless you have additional undisclosed income. The most common tax credit for most people is student loan interest. If you pay $500 in student loan interest, that sum is subtracted from your tax bill.",

In other words, just under $10,000 taxable unless you have other income you haven't disclosed. For MFJ, you are at the 10% bracket up to $18,450 in taxable income.  I would withdraw just enough to 'top off' the 10% bracket each year, whether or not you send it to pay down the card. You don't disclose the rate, but if you are able take a low interest loan to get to a sub 5% interest rate, I'd do that.",

For 2015 the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $12,600 and each of you gets 1 personal exemption ($4,000 in 2015). That's a total of $12,600 + 2*($4,000) or $20,600. Divide this by the personal exemption and you get roughly 5 allowances. Now say your employer offers health insurance and a 401(k) plan. Your total health insurance (or \"\"cafeteria\"\" contributions) are $2,000 for the year, and your total 401(k) plan contributions are $6,000 for the year. This would give an additional $2,000 + $6,000 = $8,000 divided by $4,000 = 2 allowances. Thus you would file with 7 allowances. Note that tax credits are not included in the allowance calculation. That is because they do not affect your taxable income but rather directly reduce your taxes due.\"",
