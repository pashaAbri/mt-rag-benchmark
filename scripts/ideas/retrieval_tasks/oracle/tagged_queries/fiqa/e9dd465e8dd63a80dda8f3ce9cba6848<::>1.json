It doesn't represent any value (if people decide to pay more or less for the shares, the market cap goes up or down). It does represent what people think the company is worth.  NAV sounds very much like book value. It basically says \"\"how much cash would we end up with if we sold everything the company owns, paid back all the debt, and closed down the business? \"\" Since closing down the business is rarely a good idea, this underestimates the value of the business enormously. Take a hairdresser who owns nothing but a pair of scissors, but has a huge number of repeat customers, charges $200 for a haircut, and makes tons of money every year. The business has a huge value, but NAV = price of one pair of used scissors.\"",

    "original_text": "Market Cap and NAV, or Net Asset Value, are two different ways to measure a company's worth. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares. It represents what people think the company is worth, and can change based on the perception of the company's value. On the other hand, NAV is calculated by dividing the total value of the company's assets by the number of outstanding shares. This is also known as the book value, and it represents the value of the company's assets if they were to be sold and all debts were paid off. However, NAV may not accurately reflect the true value of a company, especially if the company has a lot of intangible assets or growth potential."
