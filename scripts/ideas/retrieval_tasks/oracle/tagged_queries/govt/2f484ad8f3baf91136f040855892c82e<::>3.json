    "text": "The surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa, is made up of ice. It is covered in a thick crust of frozen water that is estimated to be between 10 to 100 kilometers thick. The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nJupiter’s moon Europa and its global ocean may currently have conditions suitable for life. Scientists are studying processes on the icy surface as they prepare to explore.\nIt’s easy to see the impact of space debris on our Moon, where the ancient, battered surface is covered with craters and scars. Jupiter’s icy moon Europa withstands a similar trouncing – along with a punch of super-intense radiation. As the uppermost surface of the icy moon churns, material brought to the surface is zapped by high-energy electron radiation accelerated by Jupiter.\nNASA-funded scientists are studying the cumulative effects of small impacts on Europa’s surface as they prepare to explore the distant moon with the Europa Clipper mission and study the possibilities for a future lander mission. Europa is of particular scientific interest because its salty ocean, which lies beneath a thick layer of ice, may currently have conditions suitable for existing life. That water may even make its way into the icy crust and onto the moon’s surface.\nNew research and modeling estimate how far down that surface is disturbed by the process called “impact gardening.” The work, published July 12 in Nature Astronomy, estimates that the surface of Europa has been churned by small impacts to an average depth of about 12 inches (30 centimeters) over tens of millions of years. And any molecules that might qualify as potential biosignatures, which include chemical signs of life, could be affected at that depth.\nThat’s because the impacts would churn some material to the surface, where radiation would likely break the bonds of any potential large, delicate molecules generated by biology.",
