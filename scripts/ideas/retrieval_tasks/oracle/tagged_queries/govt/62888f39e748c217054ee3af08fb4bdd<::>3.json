At the core of the state’s well-established comprehensive system for addressing impaired driving is a set of strict laws which are supported by effective enforcement, prosecution, adjudication, and offender programs.\nThe Governor’s Traffic Safety Committee (GTSC) plays the central role in the promotion and coordination of multiple components of New York’s Impaired Driving Program. The funds and other resources GTSC invests to reduce impaired driving are complemented by a number of other federal, state, local and private sector activities. \n\n \n\n Taking Action\n \n\n Impaired Driving Resources\n \n\ncard image\n\n Efforts to Reduce Impaired Driving\n\n NYS has a comprehensive system for addressing impaired driving, which is supported by a variety of programs.\n\nDetecting Drug ImpairmentARIDE InformationDRE Information\n\nEfforts to Reduce Impaired Driving\n\n DRE / ARIDE Training\n\n Advanced law enforcement training across New York state.\n\nDRE / ARIDE Training\n\ncard image\n\n DRE Program Resources\n\n Contact information for DRE Officers and Agency Coordinators, as well as login for the DRE Data Management System.\n\nDRE Agency CoordinatorsDRE Data Management LoginNYS DRE Officers\n\nDRE Program Resources\n\nCannabis & Driving\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nEmpowering Communities\nSTOP-DWI Program",

    "original_text": "It seems like you're asking for a continuation of the previous topic related to safe driving practices. Here are some tips for motorcyclists and motorists:\nTips for Motorcyclists:\n1. Protect your melon! Always wear a DOT-approved helmet and eye protection. \"Novelty Helmets\" are not approved and offer little protection to the rider in a crash. In fact, they are illegal to wear on New York roadways.\n2. Always wear high-quality riding gear designed to protect the rider during a fall. This includes over-the-ankle boots, full-finger gloves with padding, in addition to jackets and pants with armor protection at impact points.\n3. Be conspicuous. Wear high visibility vests, garments with reflector features, and accessories to boost your visibility to other drivers.\n4. Maintain your motorcycle properly. Ensure all of your lights and horn are working and both mirrors are adjusted. Make sure your tires are properly inflated and have legal tread depth. Remember, motorcycles maintain a smaller tire contact patch on the roadway when compared to other vehicles. Good traction is a key component to safe handling and braking in normal and adverse situations.\n5. Maintain a high level of awareness. Scan the roadway constantly for dangers and ride alert. If you are tired, take a break and re-energize to boost your concentration.\n6. Drive sober. Never ride impaired by alcohol or drugs and discourage other riders from making a bad choice.\nTips for Other Motorists:\n1. Share the road. Motorcycles are vehicles with the same rights and privileges as any other vehicle on the roadway.\n2. Always check your blind spots before changing lanes. Motorcycles are much smaller than other vehicles and can easily go unnoticed.\n3. Allow extra space when following a motorcycle. Motorcycles can stop more quickly than other vehicles, so it's essential to maintain a safe following distance.\n4. Use your signals. Signaling your intentions can help prevent crashes and keep everyone on the road safe.\n5. Stay focused on the road and your surroundings. Avoid distractions such as cell phones and other activities that can take your attention away from driving.\n6. Drive sober. Never drive impaired by alcohol"
