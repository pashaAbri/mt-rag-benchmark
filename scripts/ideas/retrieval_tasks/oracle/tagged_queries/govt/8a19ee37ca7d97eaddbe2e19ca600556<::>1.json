It will also keep out microbes which are needed to break down your waste. If you use a closed bin make sure to add a shovel full of soil from the ground.Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. It can be helpful to have a hose within reach if weather is dry.Pallets make great open compost bins and free if you can get a hold of them. They should be stamped, look for ones that say HT for heat treated. If stamp says MB leave them be and keep looking.If you make your own closed bin with a vessel like a garbage can, you will need to drill holes to allow oxygen exchange.Step 2: Gather MaterialsA common way to describe materials that go in your compost is brown or greens. Browns are higher in carbon while greens have a higher nitrogen to carbon ratio.3 parts brown to 1 part green is optimal. This ratio does not have to be exact but will generally achieve the best results.Leave out feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics or non organic matter.Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink.",
