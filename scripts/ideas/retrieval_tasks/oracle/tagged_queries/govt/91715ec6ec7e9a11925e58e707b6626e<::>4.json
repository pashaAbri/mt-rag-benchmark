Any certificate issued prior to 2000 is only acceptable if you have a copy of it and you were under 18 years of age when it was issued. All NYS boating safety certificates issued\r\n\tafter 2000, regardless of age, are acceptable.\nI took course prior to 2000, but lost my certificate - what should I do?\r\n\tUnfortunately, we do not have records for all students who took the course prior to the year 2000. Search for your record online at ilostmycard.com. You can also email us at boating@parks.ny.gov with your name and date of birth to search for your record. If your record is not found, you will need to retake the course to obtain a certificate.\nCan I use my NY safety certificate in other states?\r\n\tYes, because the New York Safe Boating Certificate is nationally accredited and valid in other states and Canada. Please note that the Adventure License is not acceptable proof of a safe boating certificate outside of New York State.\nI'm visiting New York. Will my safety certificate from my home state be sufficient?\r\n\tYes, provided it was issued from your current state of residence, and the course was approved by the National Association of Boating Law Administrators. Look for the NASBLA logo on your certificate.\nI just bought a motor boat; will I need a course immediately?\r\n\tIn 2024, if you were born January 1, 1978 or later, you will need a certificate before you can legally operate the boat. Starting in 2025, everyone, regardless of age, will need a certificate before they can legally operate their boat.\nWill I need a course in order to rent a motorboat in New York?\r\n\tNo. If you are at least 18 years old, you may rent without completing a course. The livery must demonstrate how to properly use the boat before renting it. Persons under the age of 18 may only rent a motorboat if they hold a \r\n\tsafety certificate.\nI lost my safety certificate. How can I get a replacement?\r\n\tYou can order your replacement certificate online at https://www.ilostmycard.com/\nWhat if I lost my temporary certificate?",

However, if you lost temporary certificates, the temporary certificates cannot be replaced. If you are within 7 days of your temporary certificate’s expiration date and have not yet received your card, you are advised to email [boating@parks.ny.gov](mailto:boating@parks.ny.gov). However, please note that NYS can only issue replacement certificates for the NY Safe Boating Course.\n|user|: do I have to have Boating safety certificates ?\n|assistant|: In New York, certain individuals are required to have a boating safety certificate. Specifically, anyone operating a Personal Watercraft (JetSki™, Wave Runner™, etc.) must have a boating safety certificate and be at least 14 years of age or older. Starting in 2024, if you are operating any other type of motorized boat, you will need a safety certificate if you were born on or after January 1, 1978. Starting in 2025, all operators of motorized vessels, regardless of age, will be required to have a safety certificate. However, if you are renting a boat, you do not need a safety certificate if you are at least 18 years old, although the livery must demonstrate how to properly use the boat before renting it. Persons under the age of 18 may only rent a motorboat if they hold a safety certificate.\n|user|: I need to register my boat and boat trailer\n|assistant|: You can either register your boat online or call the DMV at (518) 486-9786. Note that if your boat is powered by a motor (electric or fuel-driven), it must be registered, regardless of the size of the craft or the motor.\n|user|: Can I use my NY safety certificate in other states?"
