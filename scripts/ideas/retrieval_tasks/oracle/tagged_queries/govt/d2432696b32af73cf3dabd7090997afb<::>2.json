Furthermore, the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface.

        "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe self-destruct maneuver would have satisfied NASA’s planetary protection requirements, avoiding any chance Juno could crash into the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, or Callisto – ocean worlds, with Europa in particular considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth – and contaminate them with microscopic life from Earth.  The Cassini mission, orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017, prompted similar concerns – protecting the integrity of Saturn’s moons Enceladus and Titan, also believed to contain possibly habitable environments. As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end. The same fate befell NASA’s Galileo orbiter – Juno’s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.  With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno’s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter’s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere. Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA’s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system’s largest planet.

In celebration of 50 orbits, this graphic contains 50 images that provide just a small sampling of the data Juno has returned so far, including images from JunoCam and other instruments, and spectacular views of Earth, Jupiter, and Jupiter’s large moons Ganymede, Europa, and Io. https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/news/nasa-s-juno-mission-marks-50-orbits-around-jupiter JunoCam Images20 ImagesGo To GalleryGo To GalleryLaunch and Cruise PhasesJuno began its circuitous five-year journey to Jupiter on Aug. 5, 2011, launching from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida’s Atlantic coast.  With the four-ton probe and its wide solar arrays folded inside the nose, an Atlas V rocket thundered aloft at 12:25 p.m. EDT (26:25:00 UT) from Launch Complex 41 – the same pad where the Voyager and New Horizons spacecraft took flight, and where the Viking landers, and Curiosity and Perseverance rovers headed to Mars. Juno, likewise, set a course away from Earth toward the outer planets. It crossed the orbit of Mars, but didn’t continue onto Jupiter quite yet. Mission designers used the Sun’s gravity and a pair of main engine burns in September 2012 to guide Juno back toward Earth – an essential detour.  Juno returned home 26 months after it left. But it didn’t stop.  It dashed toward Earth, pulled in by gravity, then sped away with greater energy than before. In this maneuver, called a gravity assist, Juno borrowed some momentum from Earth – which itself is hurtling through space around the Sun at 18 miles per second (29 kilometers per second). This slingshot effect boosted Juno’s velocity by 16,330 mph (about 7.3 kilometers per second), giving the spacecraft sufficient energy to climb away from the inner solar system and make it out to Jupiter.",

He realized he was seeing moons – the first discovered beyond Earth. In June 2016 as it approached Jupiter, NASA's Juno spacecraft enjoyed the same orbital ballet that Galileo witnessed, and captured a unique time-lapse movie of the Galilean moons in motion around the planet. The movie begins on June 12, 2016, with Juno 10 million miles (16 million kilometers) from Jupiter, and ends on June 29, 3 million miles (5 million kilometers) distant. The innermost moon is volcanic Io; next in line is the ice-crusted ocean world Europa, followed by massive Ganymede, and finally, heavily cratered Callisto.Learn MoreSpacecraft DesignWith a distinctive silhouette, like a three-bladed fan spinning through space, the Juno orbiter would fill a basketball court. Its hexagonal main body measures about 11.5 feet high and wide (3.5 meters), and the “blades” – actually huge solar arrays – give it an overall width exceeding 66 feet (20 meters).  Juno’s rotation keeps it stable in flight – the way a spinning top or gyroscope remains steady – as the spacecraft spins twice per minute for science operations, which it increased to five rotations per minute when it performed main-engine maneuvers. Also, Juno’s instruments are all fixed, so the rotating spacecraft gives each of them regular turns at their targets during close passes over Jupiter, a trip that takes about two hours from pole to pole.",

Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that likely governed our solar system as it formed. Our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also help us understand planetary systems being discovered around other stars.  Theories about solar-system formation all begin with the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust, or nebula, the bulk of which went into forming the infant Sun. Like the Sun, Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and helium, so it must have formed early, capturing most of the material left over after our star came to be. How this happened, however, is unclear.  Unlike Earth, Jupiter's giant mass allowed it to hold onto its original composition; like a time capsule, it provides us with a way to trace our solar system's history. Deciphering the origin and evolution of Jupiter will help us understand the formation of the rest of the solar system, including how Earth came to be, and how it became a haven for life. Juno completed its primary mission by mid-2021, offering revelations about Jupiter’s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere – the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Now Juno has pivoted to an extended mission, in which NASA’s most distant planetary orbiter expands on the discoveries it already made, while also exploring the full Jovian system. That includes the dust in the planet’s faint rings, and three of Jupiter’s four Galilean Moons – Ganymede, Europa, and Io – so named because in 1610 Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first to identify the quartet of satellites (Callisto is the fourth – farther out than the other three, and not visited by Juno). seeing what galileo sawJupiter's MoonsIn January 1610, astronomer Galileo Galilei saw four points of light near Jupiter; but they didn't traverse the sky like other stars, they remained close to the planet.

Then, as part of its 57th and 58th orbits around the giant planet, Juno came within roughly 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of Io's surface – less than the distance between Los Angeles and Seattle. The close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. Meanwhile, the gravitational pull Io exerted on Juno during the Feb. 3 flyby has reduced the spacecraft’s orbit around Jupiter to 33 days.",

    "original_text": "Sure! Since its arrival at Jupiter in 2016, NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries. Here are some of the most notable ones:\n1. **Jupiter's Magnetic Field**: Juno has provided detailed measurements of Jupiter's magnetic field, revealing that it is stronger than expected and asymmetric.\n2. **Jupiter's Interior Structure**: By studying the gravitational field of Jupiter, Juno has provided insights into the planet's interior structure, suggesting that the core is massive and possibly surrounded by a dilute layer of hydrogen and helium.\n3. **Jupiter's Atmosphere**: Juno's microwave radiometer has penetrated Jupiter's deep atmosphere, providing information about its composition, temperature, and weather patterns.\n4. **Jupiter's Rings and Moons**: Juno has studied Jupiter's ring system and its four largest moons (Ganymede, Europa, Io, and Callisto), providing new insights into their composition and formation.\n5. **Jupiter's Auroras**: Juno has observed Jupiter's auroras in unprecedented detail, revealing their complex structure and relationship with the planet's magnetic field.\nAs for the most important discoveries during its way to Jupiter, the key event was the successful execution of a gravity assist maneuver with Earth in 2013. This maneuver provided the necessary speed boost for Juno to reach Jupiter, demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique for interplanetary travel."
