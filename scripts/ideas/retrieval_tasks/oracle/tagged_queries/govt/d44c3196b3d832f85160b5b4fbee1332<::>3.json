The Federal Trade Commission offers information about preventing and responding to identify theft.\n\n Imposter scams\n \n\nImposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization. Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.\n\n Mail fraud\n \n\nMail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n Phishing\n \n\nIn phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn’t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts. Read more.\n\n Spoofing\n \n\nSpoofing occurs when a caller disguises the information shown on your caller ID. This gives the caller the ability to disguise or \"spoof\" the name and/or number to appear as though they are calling as a certain person from a specific location.\n\n Wire or money transfer fraud\n \n\nSome scammers trick you into wiring or transferring money to steal from you. One common example of a wire transfer fraud is the “grandparent scam.”",
