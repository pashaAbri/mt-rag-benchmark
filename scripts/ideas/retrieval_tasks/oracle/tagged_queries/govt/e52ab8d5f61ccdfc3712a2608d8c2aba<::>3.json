Protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites.Summertime means mosquitoes and West Nile virus season. An infected mosquito bite can make you or a family member sick with West Nile virus. Stay healthy this summer. Take steps to avoid mosquito bites, especially in from evening to morning when the mosquitoes that spread West Nile virus are most active.How many people get sick with West Nile virus?Nearly 44,000 cases of West Nile virus disease (West Nile virus) have been reported in the United States since 1999. Of those, over 20,000 people have had infections of the brain or spinal cord and more than 1,900 people have died. Many more cases of illness are not reported to CDC.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: West Nile virus activity by state in the United States, 2016.

Depending on the year, some states report more West Nile cases than others. Some areas of the United States also report cases of other viruses spread by mosquitoes, such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus or La Crosse Encephalitis Virus.Though anyone can get infected with West Nile virus, some people are at higher risk for infection of the brain or spinal cord.",

For example, people over the age of 50 are at higher risk for encephalitis (swelling of the brain).What are the symptoms of a West Nile virus infection?No Symptoms in Most PeopleMost people (70-80%) who become infected with West Nile virus do not have any symptoms.Fever in Some PeopleAbout 1 in 5 people who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with this type of West Nile virus recover completely, but feeling tired and weak can last for weeks to months.Severe Symptoms in a Few PeopleLess than 1% of people who are infected will develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord). The symptoms of neurologic illness can include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, seizures, or paralysis. See your healthcare provider if you think you have symptoms of West Nile virus.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nWhy risk a severe illness this summer?",
