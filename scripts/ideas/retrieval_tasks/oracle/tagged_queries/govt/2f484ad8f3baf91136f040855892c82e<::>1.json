Exploring this ocean world with our Europa Clipper spacecraft could provide new clues in our search for life beyond Earth. Scheduled to launch in October 2024, Europa Clipper’s main science goal is to determine whether there are places below the surface of Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life. Credit: NASA\n\nJupiter’s moon Europa shows strong evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust. Beyond Earth, Europa is considered one of the most promising currently habitable environments in our solar system. \nBelow Europa’s icy surface, evidence suggests there is a global ocean with more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined. Europa could have all the “ingredients” needed for life as we know it: \n\nWater: Twice as much as Earth’s oceans \n\nOrganics: Essential chemical building blocks from a variety of sources\n\nEnergy: Chemical energy sources from the surface and the sea floor\n\nStability: Conditions remaining similar for 4 billion years\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will perform approximately 50 close flybys of the moon, gathering detailed measurements to investigate whether the moon could have conditions suitable for life. Europa Clipper is not a life detection mission – its main science goal is to determine whether there are places below Europa’s surface that could support life.\n\nEuropa Up Close\n\nTake an in-depth look at Jupiter's icy moon and Europa Clipper's plans for investigation.\n\nLearn more ›\n\nScience ObjectivesScience Objectives\nEuropa Clipper has three main science objectives: \n\nDetermine the Thickness of Europa’s Icy Shell & How the Ocean Interacts With the Surface",

        "text": "New Video Series Captures Team Working on NASA's Europa Clipper – NASA's Europa Clipper\nThe new video series “Spacecraft Makers: Europa Clipper” offers quick updates on the mission’s progress and lifts the curtain on the exacting work that goes into making sure the spacecraft reaches the Jupiter system in 2030. Europa Clipper aims to help answer questions about the ocean that scientists strongly believe lies below Europa’s icy crust.\n\nLearn More\n\nAssembly\n\nInstruments\n\nMeet Europa Clipper\n\nThe spacecraft will fly by the moon about 50 times while orbiting Jupiter. (It can’t orbit Europa because doing so would bring Europa Clipper too close to the gas giant’s brutal radiation belts. Learn more in the video.) On each flyby, a suite of science instruments will gather data on how deep the subsurface ocean is, how thick the ice crust is, and, potentially, the characteristics of any plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. The goal is to find out whether Europa has the potential to support life.\nThe series’ premiere episode features Europa Clipper Project Manager Jordan Evans, who also has worked on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover and the agency’s Hubble Space Telescope. In the video, he joins Deputy Science Manager Trina Ray, who worked on NASA’s Cassini and Galileo missions. They venture into JPL’s storied High Bay 1 clean room, where the Europa Clipper spacecraft is under construction – and where all of NASA’s Mars rovers, the twin Voyager spacecraft, and other historic spacecraft were assembled.\nWhile you’re digging into the nuts and bolts of the spacecraft, check out a 24-hour live feed of assembly in progress in High Bay 1.\nAdditional episodes of “Spacecraft Makers” will include more activity inside other clean rooms where components of Europa Clipper are coming together. Future seasons of the series will cover other missions under construction at JPL.\nMore About the Mission\nEuropa Clipper’s main science goal is to determine whether there are places below the surface of Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life. The mission’s three main science objectives are to understand the nature of the ice shell and the ocean beneath it, along with the moon’s composition and geology.",
