        "text": "Oral Argument - California Appellate Courts\nWhat does my lawyer do in oral argument? If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\n \n Can I get a transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case? All oral arguments in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription service and pay them a separate fee.\n \n What does the court think if I do not make an oral argument? If you decide not to make an oral argument, the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don’t care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief. The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the court decides an appeal.\n \n How will the court decide if there are no oral arguments? If all the parties waive oral argument – meaning no parties talk to the justices in person – then the Court of Appeal will decide your appeal based on the briefs, the law, and the record on appeal.\n \n What does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don’t need oral argument? Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\nEven though the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument. You would need to give the court notice in writing and tell them you want to make an oral argument. As long as you meet the deadline in the court’s notice about oral argument, the court will almost always schedule time for your oral argument.\n \n Where can I get legal help? Form APP-001 has full instructions on appeal procedures.\nEach Court of Appeal has self-help resources online. You can also contact your local Court of Appeal to see if they have a self-help center at the court.",
