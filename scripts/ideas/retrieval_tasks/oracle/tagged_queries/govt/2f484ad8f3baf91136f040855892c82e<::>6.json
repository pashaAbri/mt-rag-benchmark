Exploring this ocean world with our Europa Clipper spacecraft could provide new clues in our search for life beyond Earth. Scheduled to launch in October 2024, Europa Clipper’s main science goal is to determine whether there are places below the surface of Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life. Credit: NASA\n\nJupiter’s moon Europa shows strong evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust. Beyond Earth, Europa is considered one of the most promising currently habitable environments in our solar system. \nBelow Europa’s icy surface, evidence suggests there is a global ocean with more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined.

The mission's three main science objectives are to understand the nature of the ice shell and the ocean beneath it, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology. The mission’s detailed exploration of Europa will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for habitable worlds beyond our planet.\n|user|: I Europa livable for humans?\n|assistant|: Based on the information provided, Europa is not considered directly livable for humans. However, it is considered one of the most promising currently habitable environments in our solar system due to the presence of a vast ocean beneath its icy crust. This ocean could potentially contain conditions suitable for life as we know it. The Europa Clipper mission is designed to investigate whether the moon could have conditions suitable for life, but it is not a life detection mission. Europa could have all the “ingredients” needed for life as we know it:\nWater: Twice as much as Earth’s oceans\nOrganics: Essential chemical building blocks from a variety of sourcesEnergy: Chemical energy sources from the surface and the sea floor\n\nStability: Conditions remaining similar for 4 billion years\n|user|: The surface of Jupiter Europa\n|assistant|: The surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa, is made up of ice. It is covered in a thick crust of frozen water that is estimated to be between 10 to 100 kilometers thick. The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"\n|user|: Who funds the Clipper mission?\n|assistant|: The Europa Clipper mission is funded by NASA, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for civilian space exploration and aeronautics research. NASA's budget comes primarily from Congressional appropriations. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million.\n|user|: Does NASA have an intern program?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA does offer an internship program. The NASA Internships program is for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as educators, and provides students with the opportunity to work with professionals in their field of interest and gain valuable experience. You can find more information about the program and how to apply on NASA's official website. I'm not a science or engineering student. Can I still get an internship at NASA?\n\nYes! Interns may support a variety of business and program management work, including human resources, administration and program analysis, accounting and budget, communication and public relations, procurement and contracts, information technology, security, and education.

It holds the spacecraft’s 24 engines and nearly 6,000 pounds (2,750 kilograms) of fuel in tanks, as well as the spacecraft’s helium pressurant tanks. \nVault\n\nEuropa Clipper's electronics are enclosed in a vault with walls made of 1/3-inch thick (9.2-mm) sheets of aluminum-zinc alloy to protect the electronics from Jupiter’s intense radiation. These electronics include computers (or the “brains” of the spacecraft), flight software, and more. The vault is bolted to the spacecraft’s propulsion module and has wires to provide communications and control across the entire spacecraft.\nPower\n\nEuropa Clipper’s “wings” - its solar arrays - span more than 100 feet (30.5 meters). Each wing is approximately 46.5 feet (14.2 meters) long and about 13.5 feet (4.1 meters) high. The huge arrays are needed to collect sunlight to power the spacecraft while it operates at Jupiter, which is more than five times as far from the Sun as Earth is.\nCommunications \n\nEuropa Clipper’s 10-foot-diameter (3-meter-diameter) high-gain antenna (HGA) and other smaller radio antennas will be used to receive commands from Earth through NASA’s Deep Space Network. The antennas also will send data back to engineers and scientists. Europa Clipper’s antennas also will be used for gravity and radio science investigations, allowing scientists to study Europa’s gravity as the moon orbits Jupiter.\nGuidance, Navigation, & Control\n\nEuropa Clipper will use sensors, cameras, and special hardware to determine and control its position in space. Europa Clipper’s two stellar reference units, informally called “star trackers,” are small cameras with a computer that carries a catalog of stars with known positions. \nAs the cameras observes the starry sky, the computer matches the pattern of stars in the images to its star catalog and determines the spacecraft's orientation in space. Europa Clipper will also use four reaction wheels to stay pointed in the right direction.",
