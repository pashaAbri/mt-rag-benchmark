    "text": "The Big Bang is how astronomers explain the beginning of the universe. According to this theory, the universe started as a single point and then expanded to become as large as it is now, and it is still expanding. In 1927, the astronomer Georges Lemaître proposed this idea, suggesting that the universe’s expansion could continue indefinitely. The estimated age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, determined by measuring the ages of the oldest stars and the rate at which the universe is expanding. Scientists also used the Doppler shift in light from galaxies, which showed that almost all galaxies are moving away from us and from each other.",

        "text": "What is the Universe? - NASA Science\nFor nearly two-thirds of the time since the universe began, Earth did not even exist. Nor will it last forever in its current state. Several billion years from now, the Sun will expand, swallowing Mercury and Venus, and filling Earth’s sky. It might even expand large enough to swallow Earth itself. It’s difficult to be certain. After all, humans have only just begun deciphering the cosmos.While the distant future is difficult to accurately predict, the distant past is slightly less so. By studying the radioactive decay of isotopes on Earth and in asteroids, scientists have learned that our planet and the solar system formed around 4.6 billion years ago.How old is the universe?The universe, on the other hand, appears to be about 13.8 billion years old. Scientists arrived at that number by measuring the ages of the oldest stars and the rate at which the universe expands. They also measured the expansion by observing the Doppler shift in light from galaxies, almost all of which are traveling away from us and from each other. The farther the galaxies are, the faster they’re traveling away. One might expect gravity to slow the galaxies’ motion from one another, but instead they’re speeding up and scientists don’t know why. In the distant future, the galaxies will be so far away that their light will not be visible from Earth.Put another way, the matter, energy and everything in the universe (including space itself) was more compact last Saturday than it is today.Put another way, the matter, energy and everything in the universe (including space itself) was more compact last Saturday than it is today. The same can be said about any time in the past — last year, a million years ago, a billion years ago. But the past doesn’t go on forever.By measuring the speed of galaxies and their distances from us, scientists have found that if we could go back far enough, before galaxies formed or stars began fusing hydrogen into helium, things were so close together and hot that atoms couldn’t form and photons had nowhere to go. A bit farther back in time, everything was in the same spot.",

A bit farther back in time, everything was in the same spot. Or really the entire universe (not just the matter in it) was one spot.Don't spend too much time considering a mission to visit the spot where the universe was born, though, as a person cannot visit the place where the Big Bang happened. It's not that the universe was a dark, empty space and an explosion happened in it from which all matter sprang forth. The universe didn’t exist. Space didn’t exist. Time is part of the universe and so it didn’t exist. Time, too, began with the big bang. Space itself expanded from a single point to the enormous cosmos as the universe expanded over time.What is the universe made of?The universe contains all the energy and matter there is. Much of the observable matter in the universe takes the form of individual atoms of hydrogen, which is the simplest atomic element, made of only a proton and an electron (if the atom also contains a neutron, it is instead called deuterium). Two or more atoms sharing electrons is a molecule. Many trillions of atoms together is a dust particle. Smoosh a few tons of carbon, silica, oxygen, ice, and some metals together, and you have an asteroid. Or collect 333,000 Earth masses of hydrogen and helium together, and you have a Sun-like star.For the sake of practicality, humans categorize clumps of matter based on their attributes. Galaxies, star clusters, planets, dwarf planets, rogue planets, moons, rings, ringlets, comets, meteorites, raccoons — they’re all collections of matter exhibiting characteristics different from one another but obeying the same natural laws.Scientists have begun tallying those clumps of matter and the resulting numbers are pretty wild.",

It is the idea that the universe began as just a single point, then expanded and stretched to grow as large as it is right now—and it is still stretching!\r\n\t\n\nWhat's This Big Bang All About?\nIn 1927, an astronomer named Georges Lemaître had a big idea. He said that a very long time ago, the universe started as just a single point. He said the universe stretched and expanded to get as big as it is now, and that it could keep on stretching.\n\nWhat an Idea!\nThe universe is a very big place, and it’s been around for a very long time. Thinking about how it all started is hard to imagine.\n\nSome More Information\nJust two years later, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble noticed that other galaxies were moving away from us. And that’s not all. The farthest galaxies were moving faster than the ones close to us.\n\nThis meant that the universe was still expanding, just like Lemaître thought. If things were moving apart, it meant that long ago, everything had been close together. \n\nEverything we can see in our universe today—stars, planets, comets, asteroids—they weren't there at the beginning. Where did they come from?\n\nA Tiny, Hot Beginning\nWhen the universe began, it was just hot, tiny particles mixed with light and energy. It was nothing like what we see now. As everything expanded and took up more space, it cooled down.\nThe tiny particles grouped together. They formed atoms. Then those atoms grouped together. Over lots of time, atoms came together to form stars and galaxies.\nThe first stars created bigger atoms and groups of atoms. That led to more stars being born. At the same time, galaxies were crashing and grouping together.",
