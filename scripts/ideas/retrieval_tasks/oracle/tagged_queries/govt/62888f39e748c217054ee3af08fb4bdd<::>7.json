The pedestrian signal, when activated, provides time for the pedestrian to enter the street on the steady \"Walk\" and to finish crossing the street on the flashing \"Don't Walk\" signal. The pedestrian signal is normally activated by a push-button that tells the signal controller that there is a pedestrian who wishes to cross the street.\nDrivers and pedestrians must work together to demonstrate safe road behaviors, helping protect themselves and those around them. To ensure safety, pedestrians should make themselves visible by wearing bright-colored clothes and carrying a flashlight when walking at night. They should avoid dangerous behaviors, such as jaywalking, staying sober, and making eye contact with drivers. Pedestrians should also refrain from using their phones while walking, as talking and texting can distract them from paying attention to their surroundings.\nBefore crossing a street, pedestrians should look before stepping, cross streets at marked crosswalks or intersections, obey traffic signals, and watch for turning vehicles. It's important to look left-right-left before crossing a street.",

Drivers and pedestrians must work together to demonstrate safe behaviors on the road, helping to protect themselves and those around them.\n\nSafety tips for pedestrians:\n\nMake yourself visible: wear bright colored clothes and carry a flashlight if you are walking at night.\nAvoid dangerous behaviors: always walk on the sidewalk (no jaywalking), stay sober and make eye contact with drivers – don’t assume the driver can see you.\nStay off your phones, talking and especially texting distracts you from paying attention to your surroundings.\nLook before you step: cross streets at marked crosswalks/intersections, obey traffic signals and watch for turning vehicles.\nLook left-right-left before crossing a street.\n\nSafety tips for drivers:\n\nDon’t speed, follow the speed limit and never use your phone; always be cautious of your surroundings.\nNever drive under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.\nLook out for pedestrians, especially in hard-to-see conditions such as at night or in bad weather.\nPedestrians have the right of way at any crosswalk or intersection, so yield and be prepared to stop.\nStop at the crosswalk stop line to give drivers in other lanes an opportunity to see and yield to pedestrians too.\nBe cautious when backing up – pedestrians, especially young children, can move across your path.\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nFor safety tips on how to be a pedestrian; Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center \nFor helpful tips to keep your children safe as a pedestrian: Safe Kids \nFor additional safety tips, research and statistics on pedestrians: NHTSA \nTo learn about the dangers of being a pedestrian and who is at risk: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nLearn how to get your child to school safely: Safe routes to school",

    "original_text": "The laws for pedestrians are not identical to those for motorcycles, but they are designed to ensure safety for pedestrians. In New York, pedestrians must use crosswalks when they exist and are necessary to cross streets. They should also obey traffic signals and signs. Pedestrians must yield the right-of-way to vehicles when crossing outside of marked crosswalks or unmarked crosswalks at intersections. Pedestrians are also required to use sidewalks when available and should walk on the left side of crosswalks or intersections facing oncoming traffic if there are no sidewalks."
