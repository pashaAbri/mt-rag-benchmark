You may ask a lawyer for advice before you \r\n go to court; however, you may not have a lawyer represent you in court. The \r\n rules are fairly simple and the hearing is informal. You may even ask for\r\n mediation\r\n the day of your trial.\n\nConsider Mediation\n\r\n An alternative to formal litigation in the court \r\n is the use of a mediator to resolve Small Claims disputes. All parties \r\n must mutually agree to mediation, and the formal rules of court do not apply to \r\n the mediation process. Parties may contact the Small Claim's mediation and\r\n advisory services to make arrangements for mediation before the court hears their case.\r\n Alternatively, the court will give parties an opportunity to meet with a mediator at\r\n the time of trial.\n\nInstead of a judge, you decide the outcome of your \r\n case\r\n \nYou can discuss many issues that may not be \r\n admitted in court \n\n\r\n The party filing the claim is the plaintiff. \r\n The person being sued is the defendant.\n\r\n If you are the defendant and are filing a Claim of \r\n Defendant, you will remain the defendant and the plaintiff will remain the \r\n plaintiff.\n\r\n The Small Claims court clerks can answer many \r\n kinds of questions and provide the forms you need; however, they are prohibited \r\n by law from giving legal advice. The Small Claims Mediation and Advisory Services provides legal \r\n advice free of charge to both the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\r\n If you choose Small Claims court to resolve a \r\n dispute and you are the plaintiff, you give up the right to have another court \r\n review the Small Claims judge's decision. In other words, the plaintiff has no \r\n right of appeal. So if you should lose, that is probably the end of the case. \r\n However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. \r\n When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again.\r\n \n\nLocation and Telephone Number\n\r\n The \r\n Carol Miller Justice Center is located at 301 \r\n Bicentennial Circle. Small Claims offices are located on the 2nd floor. The courtrooms\r\n are located on the 3rd floor.",
