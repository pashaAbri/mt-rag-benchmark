        "text": "Testing | Senator Scott Wiener\nHowever, now that testing capacity has significantly expanded in the state, most people are able to receive testing at some local facilities. \n \n2) How long will test results take?\nTesting results vary widely, depending on where you get tested and what lab the test is sent to. Rapid-results testing is being expanded but has limited availability. The vast majority of test sites send the samples to a lab off-site, like Quest or LabCorp, and results generally take two to 12 days because it takes time to ship the samples, and time for the labs to process the tests. You can expect test results in as little as 24 hours at facilities with their own labs or that use a nearby facility. Consult with your healthcare provider for more specifics. \n \n3) How many people have been tested?\nAs of July 10, close to 5 milion tests have been conducted in the state. Daily coronavirus testing is averaging 80,000 - 100,000 tests per day.\n \nOpen Testing Sites\nSan Francisco\n CityTestSF, a collaboration between the city of San Francisco, local tech companies and medical providers has two sites. Both are by appointment only. To schedule appointments, see www.sf.gov/citytestsf.\nOne site, at Piers 30-32, is a drive-through site run by Carbon Health and Color Genomics and serves essential workers with symptoms. A doctor’s note is not needed.\nA second, at 600 7th St., is a drive-through site operated by One Medical and Verily. It is open to any San Francisco resident experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Visit www.projectbaseline.com/COVID19 to learn more.\nSFGH has a drive-through and walk-up testing center in the hospital parking lot at 23rd Street and Potrero Avenue.\nA UCSF drive-thru testing site is set-up at Laurel Heights.\nDignity Health-GoHealth Urgent Care is conducting rapid tests for anyone, even if you don’t have insurance, in the Castro. Hours are 8 am to 8 pm Monday to Friday and 9 am to 5 pm on weekends.",

        "text": "COVID-19 Testing: What You Need to Know | CDC\nViral tests look for a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by testing specimens from your nose or mouth.\nThere are two main types of viral tests:\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests\nAntigen tests\n\nPCR Tests\nPCR tests are the “gold standard” for COVID-19 tests. They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing. It may take up to 3 days to receive results.\nAntigen Tests\nAntigen tests* are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than PCR tests, especially when symptoms are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single PCR test can be used to confirm an antigen test result.\n\n*Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test.\nTop of PageChoosing a COVID-19 Test\nI want to get tested and:\nI have not had COVID-19 or I have not had a positive test within the past 90 days.You may choose a PCR or antigen test.\nIf you use an antigen test and your result is negative, repeat testing following FDA recommendations.\nI tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days.My first positive test result was within:30 days or less\n\nI have symptoms\nUse an antigen test. Repeat negative tests following FDA recommendations.\nI do not have symptoms\nTesting is not recommended to detect a new infection.\nMy first positive test result was within:31-90 days\n\nI have symptoms",
