Allocations to local entities generally are based on the local entity’s share of the homeless population. \nBudget‑related legislation has modified some HHAPP program features over time. Most significantly, the program has evolved to encourage coordination among local entities to address homelessness in their region and require local action plans that will facilitate assessing program performance and conducting oversight. Figure 5 provides an overview of each round of authorized HHAPP funding.

The 2000-01 budget contained $39 million for two components of EHAP:\n\nOperating Grants. $14 million of the funds are available to fund the ongoing services of homeless shelters. This level of funding\r\nis again proposed for 2001-02.\nCapital Loans. Forgivable loans totaling $25 million are available for the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of shelter\r\nfacilities.\n\nOther Programs \nCode Enforcement Incentives. Two new programs—designed to improve local enforcement of building codes—were created by\r\nChapter 664, Statutes of 2000 (AB 1382, Lowenthal), and appropriated $5 million in one-time funds. The department has received\r\nabout $30 million in applications for the two programs.\n\nCode Enforcement Incentive Program. This program ($2.75 million) provides three-year grants to local jurisdictions to\r\nincrease staffing for local code enforcement activities. The maximum grant amount is $1 million, and local matching funds must\r\nincrease over the life of the grant.\n Community Code Enforcement Pilot Program. This program ($2.25 million), with a maximum grant amount of $450,000,\r\nemphasizes improving cooperation between code enforcement officials and prosecution agencies, health departments, housing\r\nagencies, and schools.\n\nInterregional Partnership Pilot Program. This program, funded at $5 million, will provide grants to assist local governments\r\nundertaking interregional planning for housing and employment issues, with a particular emphasis on improving geographic mapping.\nChild Care Facilities. The budget appropriated $16 million for the Child Care Facilities Financing Program. The funds can be\r\nused for either direct loans or loan guarantees for child care facility purchases, expansions, or renovations. In the 2000-01 Analysis,\r\nwe reported that the program was having administrative difficulties in distributing $7 million in funds appropriated in the 1997-98\r\nbudget.",

The California Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH) is a cabinet-level body that coordinates the state's efforts to address homelessness. The ICH develops and oversees the implementation of the state's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. Additionally, the state has several programs that provide emergency shelter, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals and families. The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) also provides funding to local governments and nonprofit organizations for homelessness programs. Furthermore, there are various local initiatives and nonprofit organizations throughout the state that offer services to the homeless, such as job training, healthcare, and counseling."
