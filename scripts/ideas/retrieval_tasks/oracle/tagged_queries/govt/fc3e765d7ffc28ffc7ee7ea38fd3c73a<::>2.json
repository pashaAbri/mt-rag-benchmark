    "text": "Yes. In recent years, California housing costs have risen rapidly, particularly in terms of home purchase prices. The monthly fees for a newly purchased home are now about $2,500 higher than they were just a few years ago. The annual income required to qualify for a typical home is around $235,000—more than twice the median household income of about $85,000. To qualify for a more affordable \"bottom-tier\" home, the annual income needed is over 50% higher than the median income. The California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) originally offered a first-time home buyer program limited to low-income households, but due to few households in this income bracket being able to purchase homes, the program has been expanded to include moderate-income households. As of September 2000, home buyers in 22 counties had received funding from the state.",

        "text": "2001 Budget Analysis: California Housing Finance Agency (2260)\nAfter some experience with the programs, CHFA identified a number of problems and proposed a series of statutory changes to increase their use. These changes were incorporated into\r\nChapter 127, effective beginning July 1, 2000. For the sales price limit program, very few homes in California were being constructed for less than the original purchase price limit of $110,000.\r\nTherefore, the limit was raised to $130,000 and is now adjusted annually for changes in statewide home sales prices. The first-time home buyer program was originally limited to households of\r\nlow-income. Few households of this income level, however, are in the position of purchasing homes. Thus, this program was expanded to include moderate-income households.\n\nAs of September 2000, home buyers in 22 counties had received funding from the state. Four counties—Fresno, Kern, Riverside, and Tulare—represent more than 60 percent of the\r\nsingle-family programs' expenditures. The concentration of applicants in the Central Valley should not be particularly surprising, given that this area is one of California's fastest growing housing\r\nmarkets and often relies on the use of developer fees to finance new school construction.\nMultifamily Program. Likewise, the multifamily housing program has had limited success in funding applicants. From its allocation of $32.5 million so far, seven projects have been funded for\r\na total of $1.1 million, and another 34 projects have been approved with expected expenditures of $3.7 million. Due to the complexities of multifamily affordable housing financing and\r\nconstruction, the program takes a particularly long time to move from initial application to finished construction—typically a minimum of one year.\nConcerns About the Programs \nOur review of these housing assistance programs indicates a number of concerns with their operation, which we discuss below.\nLack of Applications Threatens Viability of Programs. Without a dramatic expansion in home buyer and multifamily developer interest in the programs, the programs will continue to be an\r\nineffective effort to increase housing affordability. So far, CHFA has limited its marketing efforts primarily to the real estate industry, such as lenders, brokers, and real estate agents. The",

Over the last few years, we have seen a rapid increase in California housing costs, led by the dramatic increase in the costs of purchasing a home. Monthly costs for a newly purchased home are about $2,500 higher than they were just a few years ago. Annual income needed to qualify for a typical home is about $235,000—over 2 times higher than median household income (about $85,000). Further, the annual income needed to qualify for a more affordable \"bottom-tier\" home is over 50 percent higher than the median income. \n\nBrian Uhler\n\nU.S. Retail Sales Update: March 2024 April 15, 2024\n\nU.S. retail sales have grown 0.8 percent over the last 3 months and 4 percent over the last 12 months. Retail sales growth has outpaced inflation over the last 12 months, but not over the last 3 months.\n\nSeth Kerstein\n\nU.S. Retail Sales Update: February 2024 March 14, 2024\n\nU.S. retail sales have dropped 0.4 percent over the last 3 months and grown 1.5 percent over the last 12 months. The 12-month growth rate was below the rate of inflation. \n\nSeth Kerstein\n\nAnnual Revision Shows State Added Few Jobs Last Year March 13, 2024\n\nEach year, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revises the state's jobs number to match actual payroll records from businesses. The latest revision lowered its count of California jobs by 1.5 percent. The corrected data show that the state added just 50,000 jobs between September 2022 and September 2023, while preliminary monthly reports had showed the labor market growing by more than 300,000 jobs. \n\nChas Alamo\n\nThe 2024-25 Budget: Property Tax Postponement Program February 29, 2024\n\nThe Governor proposes to use $7.5 million General Fund on a one-time basis to support the Property Tax Postponement (PTP) program.",

    "original_text": "Yes, there is a housing problem in California. The high demand for housing and the limited supply have led to increased housing prices and rents, making it difficult for many residents to afford housing. Some cities and unincorporated communities have implemented rent control laws to address this issue, which limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. However, courts have ruled that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a fair rate of return, meaning they must be allowed to increase rents enough to receive some profit each year. Additionally, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act limits local rent control laws by prohibiting rent control on single-family homes, newly built housing completed on or after February 1, 1995, and telling landlords what they can charge a new renter when first moving in. A more recent state law also limits rent increases for most rental housing in California to 5% plus inflation in a year or 10%, whichever is lower."
