MOXIE will test a way for future explorers to produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere for burning fuel and breathing.\nTech Specs\n\nMain Job\nTo produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere\n\nLocation\nInside the rover (front, right side)\n\nMass\nAbout 37.7 pounds (17.1 kilograms) on Earth\n\nWeight\n37.7 pounds on Earth, 14.14 pounds on Mars\n\nPower\n300 watts\n\nVolume\n9.4 x 9.4 x 12.2 inches\n(23.9 x 23.9 x 30.9 centimeters)\n\nOxygen Production Rate\nUp to 0.022 pounds per hour \n(up to 10 grams per hour)\n\nOperation Time\nApproximately one hour of oxygen (O2) production per experiment, scheduled intermittently over the duration of the mission.\n\n\"To support a human mission to Mars, we have to bring a lot of stuff from Earth, like computers, spacesuits, and habitats. But oxygen? If you can make it there, go for it — you're way ahead of the game.\" \n - Jeff Hoffman, MOXIE Deputy Principal Investigator\n\n5 Things to Know\n\nOxygen is Rare on Mars\nThere is less than 1% of air on Mars as there is on Earth, and carbon dioxide makes up about 96% of it on Mars. Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared to 21% in Earth's atmosphere. If we want oxygen on Mars, we either have to bring it along, or make it ourselves.\n\nFuel Needs Oxygen to Burn\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using — whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank. The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'",

        "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nAnother example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. A hydrogen cell of this type, in contrast, would start with the water and use electricity to turn it back into hydrogen and oxygen. The two devices, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, are nearly identical devices, operated in a very different way.\nUsing water to make oxygen on Mars would be a great idea if we had easy access to the water. But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit.",
