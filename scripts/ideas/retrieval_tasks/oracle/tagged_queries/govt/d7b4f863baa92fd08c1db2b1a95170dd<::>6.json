    "text": "A galaxy is a massive collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars held together by gravity. Each galaxy contains stars, planets, and large clouds of gas and dust. The largest galaxies can span more than a million light-years and contain trillions of stars, while the smallest galaxies may only span a few hundred light-years and contain a few thousand stars. Most large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, some with billions of times the mass of the Sun. Galaxies come in different shapes, with spirals and ellipticals being the most common and irregular galaxies having less orderly appearances. The age of most galaxies ranges between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years.",

But where is our solar system? It’s a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nA galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems. A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supermassive black hole in the middle.\n\nWhen you look up at stars in the night sky, you’re seeing other stars in the Milky Way. If it’s really dark, far away from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.\n\nThe Milky Way galaxy fills the night sky in this photo.

The Hubble Space Telescope looked at a small patch of space for 12 days and found 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some scientists think there could be as many as one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.\n\nThis is a picture taken by the NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope showing thousands of galaxies. This image covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length by someone on the ground. The universe is a very big place! Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, and STScI\n\nSome galaxies are spiral-shaped like ours. They have curved arms that make it look like a pinwheel. Other galaxies are smooth and oval shaped. They’re called elliptical galaxies. And there are also galaxies that aren’t spirals or ovals. They have irregular shapes and look like blobs.",

The largest contain trillions of stars and can be more than a million light-years across. The smallest can contain a few thousand stars and span just a few hundred light-years. Most large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, some with billions of times the Sun’s mass.Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and ellipticals, as well as those with less orderly appearances, usually dubbed irregular.Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old. Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which formed around 13.8 billion years ago. Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy formed approximately 500 million years ago.Galaxies can organize into groups of about 100 or fewer members held together by their mutual gravity.",
