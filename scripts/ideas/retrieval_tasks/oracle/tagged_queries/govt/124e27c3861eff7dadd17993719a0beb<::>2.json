They provide options such as filing a complaint against a licensee, submitting a citizen's comment/complaint about the DCA, or reporting unsafe conditions through the whistleblower hotline. Similarly, if you have a complaint related to healthcare in California, you can file a complaint with the California Department of Managed Health Care. Their website provides forms and instructions on how to submit a complaint. It's recommended to check the specific state's department or agency website for detailed information on how to file a complaint."
