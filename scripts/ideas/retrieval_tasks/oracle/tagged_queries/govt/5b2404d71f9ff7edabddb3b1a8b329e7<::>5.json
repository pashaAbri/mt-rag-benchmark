Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands. In addition, there is an undetermined amount of open-space non-forested lands with significant wildfire potential.",

We’ve seen lower rainfall and lower river levels and water tables—conditions that made it more likely that fires could escape their intended boundaries and burn into standing Amazon rainforest.”\nIt is possible to identify some understory forest fires with the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensors on the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites, but it’s challenging for satellites to detect all of them because they often burn beneath dense canopy. Sensors on Landsat 8 and 9 and the Sentinel-2 satellites offer more detailed observations than VIIRS and can sometimes detect understory fires, though they pass over the Amazon basin less frequently than VIIRS.\nThe false-color image above, captured by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) sensor on Landsat 9, shows an example of several understory fires burning in densely forested areas south of Manaus. The use of the sensor’s observations in the shortwave infrared makes it easier to identify fires.\n“Understory fires are lose-lose: they degrade the value of forests and contribute to climate change,” added Morton. “We’ve been working as quickly as possible to get data from the SERVIR Amazon Fire Dashboard and several satellites about the location of these fires to fire brigades on the ground to support suppression efforts as quickly as possible. This is an all-hands-on-deck situation.”\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Lauren Dauphin, using MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS LANCE and GIBS/Worldview and Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Human activity: Unattended campfires, burning debris, discarded cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson can all spark wildfires.\n2. Lightning: During thunderstorms, lightning strikes can ignite dry vegetation, leading to wildfires.\n3. Natural events: Hot, dry, and windy conditions can contribute to the spread of wildfires, especially in areas with abundant fuel sources like dry grass, shrubs, and trees.\n4. Equipment use: Power tools, vehicles, and farm equipment can sometimes produce sparks that start wildfires, particularly in dry and combustible environments."
