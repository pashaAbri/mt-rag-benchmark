Credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell NASA also approved a large orbiter to help discover suitable landing sites for a future Mars sample return project. That orbiter mission became the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2005.The next rover, eventually named \"Curiosity,\" was equipped for even more detailed investigation of Mars' ancient minerals and geology. It arrived on Mars on Aug. 6, 2012, and was still operating in 2020. Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover drive testing at JPL in 2010. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech JPL's next rover to Mars is a modification of Curiosity and is named Perseverance. It was launched July 30, 2020. Instead of mineralogy, it will specialize in astrobiology and look specifically for signs of past life on Mars. Perseverance is also designed to collect and store rock samples on the Martian surface for retrieval by a future Mars sample return mission, formally approved by NASA in 2019. Perseverance also hosts a robotic helicopter named Ingenuity, a technology demonstration mission that will attempt powered flight on another planet.Competing for the planetsJPL was awarded a number of other Discovery program missions after Mars Pathfinder. The Stardust mission collected particles from comet Wild-2 in 2004, while the Genesis mission returned some particles from the solar wind in 2004. The Deep Impact mission launched a kinetic impactor at Comet Tempel 1 to assess its structure and composition in 2005. The GRAIL mission, based on the GRACE gravity satellites, produced very high resolution gravity maps of the Moon, while the Dawn mission used solar-electric propulsion to visit the dwarf planet Ceres and the largest main belt asteroid, Vesta. JPL also managed the development of Ames Research Center's Kepler exoplanet astronomy mission, launched in 2009. The Laboratory's most recent Discovery program mission, InSight, landed on Mars Nov. 26, 2018. Its mission was to measure martian seismic activity and the heat flow coming from Mars' interior. JPL's next Discovery mission, Psyche, is being designed to explore the unusual main belt asteroid 16 Psyche during the late 2020s.
