They can develop slowly or quickly, with flash floods occurring suddenly and without warning. Floods can cause power outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and lead to landslides. Their impact can range from local to widespread, affecting entire river basins and multiple states. While some floods develop slowly over days, flash floods can emerge within minutes, carrying dangerous debris and swiftly sweeping away whatever is in their path.",

Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death.\nFloods may:\nResult from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges and overflows of dams and other water systems.Develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can come with no warning.Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings and create landslides.\n If you are under a flood warning:\n\nImage\n \n\nFind safe shelter right away.Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!Remember, just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.Stay off bridges over fast-moving water.Depending on the type of flooding:Evacuate if told to do so.Move to higher ground or a higher floor.Stay where you are.\n\nPreparing for a Flood\n\nKnow Your Risk for FloodsVisit FEMA's Flood Map Service Center to know types of flood risk in your area.  Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.\nPurchase Flood InsurancePurchase or renew a flood insurance policy. Homeowner’s insurance policies do not cover flooding. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect so the time to buy is well before a disaster. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\n\nPreparing for a FloodMake a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area.\nIn Case of EmergencyKeep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies. Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a sump pump with a battery.",

Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states.\nHowever, all floods are not alike. Some floods develop slowly, sometimes over a period of days. But flash floods can develop quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain. Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water that carries rocks, mud, and other debris and can sweep away most things in its path. Overland flooding occurs outside a defined river or stream, such as when a levee is breached, but still can be destructive. Flooding can also occur when a dam breaks, producing effects similar to flash floods.\nBe aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can flood. Every state is at risk from this hazard.\nWhat is the flood risk where I live?\nHow can I protect myself from a flood?\n\nKnow your flood terms\nWhat to do before a flood\nWhat to do during a flood\nWhat to do after a flood\n\nLast Modified: Friday, 13-Jun-2008 13:32:33 EDT\n\nFast Facts\nLearn about flood risk and flood insurance\nSignificant Flood Events\nFlood Health Risks\n\nSolutions\n\nRepair Flood Damage\nBuy Flood Insurance\n\nOnline Tools\n\nMap Service Center\n\nRelated Topics\n\nFlood Photos\nFloodplain Management\nFlood Hazard Mapping\n\nHome\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImportant Notices\nFOIA\nNo FEAR Act Data\nUSA.gov\nDHS\n\nFEMA 500 C Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20472Disaster Assistance: (800) 621-FEMA, TTY (800) 462-7585\n\n \n\n",
