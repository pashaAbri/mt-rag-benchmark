        "text": "Identity Theft Awareness - Privacy\nDo not be fooled by spam. We all enjoy finding a bargain, but do not be fooled by spam emails offering great deals or claiming they support good causes. If it seems too good to be true it probably is. Responding to or clicking on any link within an unsolicited email or pop-up box can put your personal information in jeopardy.\nGive your debit card a break. Be especially wary of using your debit card when shopping online. If an identity thief gets hold of your debit card information, he or she can drain your bank account or open new accounts in your name. If you have a credit card, use it instead. Credit cards typically provide added protection against fraudulent charges.\nBe cautious when downloading mobile applications. Mobile apps often take more data from you than they need, either for their own use or to sell to third parties. To prevent your information from getting into the wrong hands, only download applications from official app stores and check other users’ reviews, as well as the app’s privacy policies, before downloading.\nUse a variety of passwords. If you use the same password for all your online activities, and an identity thief uncovers it, he or she could have access to your bank, email, and other personal accounts. As you shop at different online retailers, choose a different password for each new account that you create. Also, avoid using your name or the names of family members in your password. Social media has made those passwords even easier to crack.\nIdentity Theft Prevention Tips for Traveling\nTraveling offers identity thieves plenty of opportunity to steal your information. Hotel rooms, airplanes and trains, public internet access – all can be problematic if you let your privacy guard down. The following are successful strategies for safeguarding your identity when away from home.\nClean out your wallet. Before you travel, plan to carry only the necessities for your trip and nothing extra. This way, if your wallet gets misplaced or stolen during your travels, you will have reduced the number of things that need to be replaced, as well as the amount of personal information that could be at risk.\nCopy and disperse copies of your identification.",

Credit monitoring detects if any unusual or unauthorized activity is taking place.\n\nIdentity Theft Prevention TipsGeneral Identity Theft Prevention Tips\nUse strong passwords. Create passwords that employ a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid obvious passwords—never use your birth date, mother’s maiden name, or the last four digits of your Social Security number.\nLock up your records. Keep any financial documents and records containing your sensitive information in a secure place in your home or office. Try to avoid carrying around items that contain your personal information. For digital records, consider the use of encrypted storage drives or password-protected files.\nShred sensitive documents. Tear, cut up, or shred sensitive materials, such as old records, files, bills, prescription labels, or expired credit cards before disposing of them. Once information leaves your hands, there is no way of knowing who may get their hands on it.\nSecure your wireless network. Like public or shared computers, unprotected wireless networks can put sensitive information in jeopardy. Make sure your wireless network at home is protected with a strong password, the default administrator username has been changed, and turn on Wireless Network Encryption if available.\nLock your computer. If you are using a computer at your office or in a public place, make sure to lock it before you walk away to safeguard any personal information stored on the computer.\nProtect against viruses. Regularly update anti-virus protection software on your computer. In addition, keep your computer system and browser up to date and set at the highest security level.\nDouble-check mailings. Always make sure that documents are not stuck together, and that the recipient’s information is correct before sending any Personally Identifiable Information.\nKeep your emails safe. Avoid sending any sensitive information via email. If you absolutely must use email to send personal data, consider purchasing encryption software.",

Between online shopping and gaming, streaming video and music, and virtual schooling, today’s children are spending significant time on a smartphone or computer. Setting boundaries for online activities and teaching children how to protect sensitive information is necessary.\nChildren in Elementary School (Ages 5-10)\nStart the conversation.  Ask questions to establish your child’s understanding of computers, the capabilities of the Internet, and what is considered personal information. Fill in any gaps in understanding that they have. Emphasize that they should never give out any information online – just as you would tell them not to talk to strangers).\nEstablish the rules. Pick a list of appropriate websites, games, and other programs. Use parental controls to limit access and block inappropriate sites.\nMonitor their playtime. Keep a close eye on what programs your child is using to ensure they are not providing any personal information. Avoid sharing your passwords with your children to maintain control over what they can access and prevent accidental online purchases.",

Maintain a dialogue about how they use the Internet as they start to buy things online and use social media. Explain how to keep their information safe when making purchases. If they are using your credit card to purchase things online, they are potentially putting your information at risk.\nKeep an eye on social media.
