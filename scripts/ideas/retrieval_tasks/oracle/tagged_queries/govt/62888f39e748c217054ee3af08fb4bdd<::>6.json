According to California Vehicle Code Section 21960, Caltrans and local agencies have the authority to prohibit bicyclists from traveling on freeways under their jurisdiction, and they are required to post signs stating the prohibition. Currently, there are no signs permitting bicyclists on freeways. When bicyclists legally travel on a freeway, they may be directed off at the next off-ramp by a sign that says \"Bicycles Must Exit.\"  The CHP has created a Bicycle Safety Course which holds valuable information related to bicycle safety and maintenance.",

Flashing overhead \n warning signs alert motorists that the meters are ahead \n as they make the transition from one freeway to another. \n Sensors embedded in the pavement are linked to computers, \n which will adjust the meters automatically to optimize \n the movement of traffic through the interchange. Motorists \n come to appreciate the value of ramp meters when they \n don't work -- on the few occasions when they have been \n shut off due to malfunction or maintenance, allowing \n cars to enter the freeway at random, freeway traffic \n can backup for miles.\n \n\nCan I ride my bicycle on the freeway?\n\nOf the more than 4,000 miles of freeways \n in California, about 1,000 miles are open to bicyclists. \n These open sections are usually in rural areas where \n there is no alternate route.

We all share the responsibility to make sure California roads are safe for everyone. This is achieved by following the rules of the road, watching out for others, and using courtesy while on the road.

They must follow the rules of the road, including stopping at red lights and stop signs, signaling turns, and yielding the right-of-way when necessary. Bicyclists must also ride in the same direction as traffic and use bike lanes where available. Motorists are required to give bicyclists at least three feet of space when passing. However, there are no specific speed limit laws for bicycles in New York. Bicycle riders should maintain a safe speed and adjust their speed to match the road conditions and surrounding traffic."
