It would be beneficial to visit the OGS website and explore the Procurement section for more detailed information on becoming a contractor. For the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the document mentions the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) for medical equipment, supply, pharmaceutical, and service Schedule programs, as well as the Forecast of Contracting Opportunities and VA Acquisition Regulations (VAAR). To become a contractor with the VA, it would be advisable to review these resources and consider contacting the VA directly for further guidance.\n|user|: Is VA using a seoparate procurement tool from OSG?\n|assistant|: While the VA has its own procurement resources, the OGS has centralized statewide contracts, a Purchaser Notification Service (PNS), the 1122 Program, and other procurement resources. It is possible that they use different systems for procurement, but the document does not provide a direct comparison or confirmation of this.\n|user|: Of course VA is federal !!\n|assistant|: Yes, you are correct. The VA is a federal department, and the OGS is a New York State agency. They are separate entities and may have different procurement processes and tools.\n|user|: any advantage to a women owned company??"
