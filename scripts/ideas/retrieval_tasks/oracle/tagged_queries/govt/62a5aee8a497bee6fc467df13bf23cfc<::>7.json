        "text": "Rain Brings Renewal, But Also Toxins: How Californians Can Keep Their Water Pollutant-Free This Summer | Caltrans\nCalifornia residents unknowingly contribute to water pollution through their daily activities. The use of toxic chemical pesticides or neglecting vehicular maintenance, can further pollute our water supply. These substances inevitably end up in our waterways, contaminating local lakes, rivers, streams and the ocean. Thankfully, there are simple steps all of us can take to reduce stormwater pollution and help keep our water clean.\nCalifornians can positively impact the environment by taking necessary steps to minimize contributions to water pollution. The “Let’s Change This to That” campaign via CleanWaterCA.com provides a list of tips to help support clean water from summer to winter and all year round. They include:\nPick up after your pet. A common misconception is that pet waste is a natural fertilizer and can be left to decompose in the environment. Not so! Pet waste can contain harmful bacteria such as E. coli and fecal coliform, which can carry diseases that affect wildlife and contaminate waterways when not properly disposed of.\nSave water. Reduce water pollution by sweeping your driveway instead of using the hose and, if you can, by washing your car at a facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency warns that washing cars and driveways at home can cause pollution as metals and fluids are washed off and enter storm drains, collecting more pollutants along the way and ending up in our waterways. If you can, choose car wash facilities that use advanced filtration systems to recycle water used for washing cars.\nGo organic. This summer consider using natural pest control methods instead of harmful pesticides. Pesticides made from highly toxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on the health of our water and the environment. By choosing organic alternatives, like companion planting or using beneficial insects like ladybugs, you can make a difference.\nGive your vehicle a tune-up. Vehicle fluids, oils and brake dust are made up of toxic heavy metals that end up on roadways and highways if we don’t provide proper maintenance.",

    "original_text": "To prevent groundwater contamination, it is recommended to follow these guidelines:\n* Purchase only what you need\n* Use products completely before disposing\n* Recycle whatever you can (oil, batteries, etc.)\n* Recycle surplus paints\nOn the other hand, the following practices should be avoided:\n* Dumping products onto the ground (they can contaminate soil and groundwater)\n* Pouring products or wastes into the street (they can contaminate oceans, lakes, and groundwater)\n* Putting hazardous or toxic products in the trash\n* Pouring products down the drain\nFor proper disposal of Household Hazardous Wastes, you can view the instructions online.\nRegarding water pollution, it is caused by various activities such as pesticide use, mining, logging, and other sources. To address this issue, relevant departments like the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDFFP), and the Department of Fish and Wildlife should be involved in implementing appropriate measures and regulations."
