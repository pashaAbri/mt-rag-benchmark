    "text": "Rental housing in California is more expensive compared to other states, with renters typically paying 50 percent more for housing. In some parts of the state, rent costs are more than double the national average. The high rent in California is due to the housing shortage, which results in fierce competition for housing, driving up rent prices. As per the rent control law, the value of rental housing would decrease because potential landlords would only be willing to pay as much for these properties. Consequently, some renters would pay less, while landlords would receive less rental income. Additionally, fewer renters would move as frequently due to rent increases. The impact of these effects would vary depending on the number of communities passing new rent control laws and the specific type and scope of rent control being adopted.",

File No. 22-0008).\nBackground\nRental Housing Is Expensive in California. Renters in California typically pay 50 percent more for housing than renters in other states. In some parts of the state, rent costs are more than double the national average. Rent is high in California because the state does not have enough housing for everyone who wants to live here. People who want to live here must compete for housing, which increases rents.\nSeveral Cities Have Rent Control Laws. Several California cities—including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose—and some unincorporated communities have laws that limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. These laws often are called rent control. About one-quarter of Californians live in communities with rent control. Local rent boards carry out rent control. These boards are paid for with fees on landlords.\nCourt Rulings Limit Local Rent Control.",

[Ballot]\nThe value of rental housing would decline because potential landlords would not want to pay as much for these properties.\nSome renters would spend less on rent and some landlords would receive less rental income.\nSome renters would move less often. For example, fewer renters would move because their rents increase.\n\nThe size of these effects would depend on how many communities pass new laws (or have existing rent control laws that could immediately become effective), and the type and scope of rent control adopted. If many localities enacted rent regulation that significantly limited rents, other economic effects locally and statewide (such as impacts on housing construction) could occur.\nChanges in State and Local Revenues. The measure’s economic effects would affect property tax, sales tax, and income tax revenues. The largest and most likely impacts are:\n\nLess Property Taxes Paid by Landlords. A decline in the value of rental properties would lead to a decrease in property tax payments made by owners of those properties over time. These property tax losses would be partially offset by higher property tax payments resulting from the sales of rental housing. This is because property sales often cause property tax bills to reset at a higher level. Revenue losses from lower property values would be larger than revenue gains from increased sales. Because of this, the measure would reduce overall property tax payments over time.\nMore Sales Taxes Paid by Renters. Renters who pay less in rent would use some of their savings to buy taxable goods.\nChange in Income Taxes Paid by Landlords. Landlords’ income tax payments would change in several ways, both up and down. Some landlords would receive less rental income. This would reduce their income tax payments. On the other hand, over time, landlords would pay less to buy rental properties. This would reduce expenses they can claim to lower their income tax payments (such as mortgage interest, property taxes, and depreciation). This would increase their income tax payments. The overall effect on state income tax revenue is not clear.\n\nOverall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues over time. The largest effect would be on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure.",

    "original_text": "The document discusses issues related to housing in California, including both home buyers and renters. For renters, several California cities and unincorporated communities have laws that limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. These laws, often called rent control, apply to about one-quarter of Californians. However, courts have ruled that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a \"fair rate of return,\" meaning that landlords must be allowed to increase rents enough to receive some profit each year. Additionally, a state law called the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act limits local rent control laws by preventing rent control from applying to single-family homes, newly built housing completed on or after February 1, 1995, and by prohibiting rent control laws from telling landlords what they can charge a new renter when first moving in. A more recent state law also limits rent increases for most rental housing in California, with landlords not being able to increase rent by more than 5% plus inflation in a year, or 10%, whichever is lower."
