For\r\nexample, the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) would be involved if pesticides were the pollutants of concern, and the California Department of\r\nForestry and Fire Protection (CDFFP) would comment on a TMDL if timber harvesting was contributing to the impairment of a water body. The Department of\r\nFish and Game would be involved if fish and wildlife were beneficial uses of water that were impacted in an impaired water body.\nThe list of impaired water bodies and TMDLs are submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for its review and approval. If U.S. EPA\r\nrejects a particular TMDL, it must establish the TMDL itself. In some cases, the development of TMDLs is carried out under a federal court settlement. These\r\nTMDLs may be developed by U.S. EPA or delegated by U.S. EPA to the state to develop.\nThe TMDL Requirements Largely Ignored from 1972 to the Early 1990s. The requirement for TMDLs was largely ignored by federal and state water quality\r\nagencies until the early 1990s. Until then, water quality regulation had been focused on controlling point sources of pollution through state and federal\r\npermitting programs. Although water quality had been improving, over 40 percent of assessed water bodies nationwide remained too polluted for fishing or\r\nswimming. It became apparent that the remaining water pollution problems—largely associated with nonpoint source pollution—required different solutions. The\r\nactivation of the TMDL program in the 1990s, in part instigated by lawsuits against the federal government to enforce the TMDL requirements, provides a\r\nplanning framework to address these problems.\nCurrent State List of Impaired Water Bodies. The most recent list of impaired water bodies in the state (1998) lists 509 impaired water bodies for which 1,471\r\nTMDLs have to be developed.",

        "text": "2001 Budget Analysis:State Water Resources \nIn contrast, nonpoint source pollution is created when water picks up\r\ncontaminants from pesticide use, mining, logging, and other sources and deposits them in water bodies.\nStates are required to develop plans—called Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)—to meet water quality standards in the impaired water bodies that have been\r\nlisted. A TMDL is developed for each pollutant contributing to the impairment of a listed water body. The development of a TMDL involves the following\r\nsteps:\n\nDetermination of how much of a particular pollutant a water body can receive from all sources and still meet water quality standards. \nDetermination of how much of the existing level of pollution must be reduced to meet water quality standards. \nAllocation of responsibility for reducing pollution to the acceptable level among the various contributing sources, including both point and nonpoint sources.\nDevelopment of a plan to implement the TMDL. While implementation plans are not currently a federal requirement, federal regulations effective later this\r\nyear will require these plans. \nAdoption of a regulation (a \"basin plan amendment\") to establish actions to implement a TMDL, such as revising permits to control waste discharges. \n\nWhen a listed water body later meets water quality standards, it is \"de-listed.\" Neither state nor federal law specifies a time schedule for the development or\r\nimplementation of TMDLs or for when listed water bodies should become de-listed. Only three of the 18 impaired water bodies on the state's initial list from\r\n1976 have been de-listed.\nState Versus Federal Role. The state is primarily responsible for compiling the list of impaired water bodies and developing TMDLs.

    "original_text": "Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, making them unsuitable for use. This can occur due to various reasons, including industrial waste disposal, sewage and wastewater discharge, oil spills, and agricultural runoff. In the case of Monterey Park, the primary source of water is local groundwater, which can also become contaminated due to improper disposal of harmful substances. As stated in the document, many household products such as cleaning supplies, pesticides, paints, and motor oil can contribute to groundwater contamination if disposed of improperly. Cleaning up contaminated groundwater can be a costly and time-consuming process, emphasizing the importance of preventing contamination in the first place."
