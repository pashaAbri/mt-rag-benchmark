Scientists studied all the original Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized vaccines in at least 3 phases of clinical trials to ensure they are safe and effective. They continue to study the updated vaccines. Hundreds of millions of people have safely received COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.\nThere is no cure for COVID-19 at this time. There are treatments for COVID-19. But the risk of severe illness and death are still high in certain groups of people. Talk to your health care provider before taking any medications to prevent or treat COVID-19. \nLearn more about COVID-19 treatments on the CDC website\nSome people report long-term effects of COVID-19. Most people get better in weeks. But some people have effects that last for a longer time. These effects may include symptoms like dizziness, depression, or feeling very tired. They may also include effects on vital organs like your heart or lungs. The effects can happen even after a mild illness.\nLearn more about long-term COVID-19 effects on the CDC website\nWhen you’re up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines, you can do more. This may include visiting with family and friends or going to different activities. Staying up to date with your vaccines reduces your risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19. \nYou can get a free COVID-19 vaccine—even if you don’t have health insurance.\nFind out how to get a COVID-19 vaccine at VA\nFind COVID-19 vaccines near you on the CDC website\n\nVaccine effectiveness\nScientists studied the original FDA authorized COVID-19 vaccines in tens of thousands of people in clinical trials. The trials included people of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities. Scientists continue to monitor the effectiveness of the vaccines over time.  \nResults show that the vaccines work well in these ways:\n\nThe vaccines help protect you from getting COVID-19. Vaccines help train your body’s natural immune system to recognize and fight a specific disease by stimulating a response to the virus that causes that disease. Over time, this protection decreases.",
