That light always beams onto Earth and Moon from the direction of the Sun, illuminating half of our planet in its orbit and reflecting off the surface of the Moon to create moonlight.Like Earth, the Moon has a day side and a night side, which change as the Moon rotates. The Sun always illuminates half of the Moon while the other half remains dark, but how much we are able to see of that illuminated half changes as the Moon travels through its orbit.This graphic shows the position of the Moon and the Sun during each of the Moon’s phases and the Moon as it appears from Earth during each phase. Not to scale.NASA/JPL-CaltechLet’s take a look at the individual phases, and how the movements of the Moon and Sun appear to us as we watch from the Northern Hemisphere on Earth:New MoonThis is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it’s also up during the day! Remember, in this phase, the Moon doesn’t usually pass directly between Earth and the Sun, due to the inclination of the Moon’s orbit. It only passes near the Sun from our perspective on Earth.Waxing CrescentThis silver sliver of a Moon occurs when the illuminated half of the Moon faces mostly away from Earth, with only a tiny portion visible to us from our planet. It grows daily as the Moon’s orbit carries the Moon’s dayside farther into view. Every day, the Moon rises a little bit later.First QuarterThe Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated side. People may casually call this a half moon, but remember, that’s not really what you’re witnessing in the sky. You’re seeing just a slice of the entire Moon ― half of the illuminated half.",

    "original_text": "It is safe to look at the Moon during a lunar eclipse because the Moon does not produce its own light, but instead reflects sunlight. During a lunar eclipse, the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, so the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow. This shadow blocks most of the Sun's light, but the small amount of light that is refracted, or bent, around the Earth's atmosphere can still reach the Moon and illuminate it, albeit dimly. This light is much less intense than the direct light from the Sun, so it is safe to look at the Moon with unprotected eyes or through a telescope during a lunar eclipse. In contrast, looking directly at the Sun during a solar eclipse can cause serious eye damage or blindness, which is why special protective equipment is necessary."
