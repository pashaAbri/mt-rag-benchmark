But even when you don’t have much time to focus on yourself, you can take small steps to make healthy eating and physical activity part of your routine. They’ll go a long way to help protect your health — and will keep you at your best for those you love.\nLearn how Joni makes time to move her way and finds creative ways to eat healthy with a baby and a young child.\n\nHow I move my way\n\nBefore I had kids, I was pretty active. I spent lots of weekends hiking or going on bike rides with friends. But 2 pregnancies in just over 4 years changed all that!\nAfter my second child was born, I was constantly tired and just didn’t have any energy. I knew it was partly because I wasn’t getting enough sleep at night — but I also realized that I missed getting active. I found that getting outside even for just 15 minutes and taking a quick walk gave me an energy boost, and it helped me feel more like my old self. I take the kids along in the stroller — sometimes we stop by the park, and my older child and I play ball while the baby naps.\nThat’s not to say getting active is easy with a young child and a baby in the house! Taking them with me on walks is a challenge sometimes — and when I finally get some time to myself after the kids are in bed, physical activity usually isn’t the first thing on my list. But I try my best to get active a few times a week, whether it’s outside or with an online exercise video. I don’t always get to do as much as I’d like, but that’s okay!",
