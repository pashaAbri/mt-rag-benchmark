All motorized vessel operators 60 and younger are required by law to complete a boating safety course and obtain a California Boater Card before heading out on the water. For more information about the California Boater Card, list of approved courses and exemptions, please visit CaliforniaBoaterCard.com.\nWelcome to the California Division of Boating and Waterways (DBW) safety and education page!  DBW relies on partnerships with many organizations (educational institutions, aquatic centers, the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and America's Boating Club/U.S. Power Squadrons) and more to provide boating safety education and positive outreach to children, youth, and adults. If you are a first-time boater or if you just want to learn the latest \"rules of the road\", this page will help make your boating activities safe and enjoyable.\n\nBoating Safety\nPlay it Safe! Almost 800,000 pleasure craft are registered in California, and the rapidly rising numbers of unregistered paddlecraft bring the number of active boaters to over four million. That’s a lot of Californians having a lot of boating adventures on thousands of miles of beautiful waterways! Unfortunately, some boaters will get hurt or die while on the water. The Coast Guard reports nearly 5,000 boating accidents each year in the United States—causing approximately 700 deaths, 3,000 injuries and $36 million in damage. About 85% of all boating deaths occur on boats where the operator has not completed a boating safety education course. The California Boater Card education program is designed to increase boating safety on California waterways.

It can be majestic as sailing around San Francisco Bay within view of the Golden Gate Bridge, or as heart-thumping as riding the flows of the Lower Kern River. Pick a destination!\r\n \n\nPump Out Stations\n\r\n Pump it. Don’t Dump it! It’s against the law. Raw sewage can spread disease, contaminate shellfish beds, and lower oxygen levels in water.",

    "original_text": "Yes, there are several safety precautions you should take when boating. First, always wear a life jacket and ensure that there are enough life jackets on board for all passengers. Second, familiarize yourself with the boat and its equipment before setting out. Third, check the weather forecast and water conditions before you go boating. Fourth, follow all navigation rules and be aware of other boats, swimmers, and obstacles in the water. Fifth, never operate a boat while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Sixth, take a boating safety course to learn about safe boating practices and laws. Finally, always file a float plan with someone on shore, so they know your boating plans and can alert authorities if you don't return on time."
