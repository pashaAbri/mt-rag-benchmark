    "text": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the steps for composting at home as outlined by Madison County, NY. Step 1: Pick Out A Bin - The bin should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size. The location can affect how fast your compost dries out or holds water. A closed bin is recommended to keep critters out. If you use a closed bin, add a shovel full of soil from the ground. Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. Step 2: Gather Materials - Browns are higher in carbon, and greens are higher in nitrogen. The optimal ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Avoid feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter. Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink. Step 3: Maintain - If you have an open bin, layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom to help with air and drainage. Layer your browns and greens, imagining you're making a bowl for your greens to lay in the middle and then adding more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung out sponge. Turning helps a pile break down faster and ensures oxygen is present. Step 4: Harvest and More! - You will know when your compost is done when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. If you do not fully turn the pile, your finished compost will be at the bottom of the pile. If you're running out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel, and toilet paper rolls make good brown additions.

It will also keep out microbes which are needed to break down your waste. If you use a closed bin make sure to add a shovel full of soil from the ground.Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. It can be helpful to have a hose within reach if weather is dry.Pallets make great open compost bins and free if you can get a hold of them. They should be stamped, look for ones that say HT for heat treated. If stamp says MB leave them be and keep looking.If you make your own closed bin with a vessel like a garbage can, you will need to drill holes to allow oxygen exchange.Step 2: Gather MaterialsA common way to describe materials that go in your compost is brown or greens. Browns are higher in carbon while greens have a higher nitrogen to carbon ratio.3 parts brown to 1 part green is optimal. This ratio does not have to be exact but will generally achieve the best results.Leave out feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics or non organic matter.Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink.",

Browns are higher in carbon and include leaves, straw, wood chips, sawdust, grass clippings, newspaper, manure from herbivores, cardboard, and garden waste. Greens are higher in nitrogen and include vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, and fresh grass clippings. The optimal ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Avoid feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter.
