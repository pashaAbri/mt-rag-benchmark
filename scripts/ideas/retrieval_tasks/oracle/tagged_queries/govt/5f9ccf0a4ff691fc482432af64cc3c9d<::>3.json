    "text": " Lottery and sweepstakes scams are one of the most common consumer frauds operating today.  You get a card, call, or email telling you that you won. Then  they tell you there is a fee, some taxes, or customs duties to pay. They ask for your bank account information, or ask you to send money via a wire transfer or to purchase gift cards and provide the card numbers. Government Impostor scams  are also very common : You get a text, call, or email from someone who says they are with the government. They may claim to be a U.S. Marshal, saying you must pay a fine for missing jury duty. Or the IRS, saying that you owe thousands in back taxes. Another scam that you must be alert occurs  when someone gets an email or most often a phone call and the caller begins speaking very quickly about common computer issues that slow performance or even potential hacks to your system. There are imposter scammers  that try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization. Today, phishing  is very common . the scammer  impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you.",

Once payment is made, little or no works is done and the project is abandoned.High Pressure Sales: A fast-talking operator might push you for an immediate decision about work, which makes it impossible for you to get the recommended three competitive bids, check their license, obtain building permits, or review references.Scare Tactics: A scam artist may offer to perform a free inspection, then claim that a serious problem such as faulty wiring, bad plumbing, or a leaky roof, will put you in danger.",

The Federal Trade Commission offers information about preventing and responding to identify theft.\n\n Imposter scams\n \n\nImposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization. Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.\n\n Mail fraud\n \n\nMail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n Phishing\n \n\nIn phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn’t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts. Read more.\n\n Spoofing\n \n\nSpoofing occurs when a caller disguises the information shown on your caller ID. This gives the caller the ability to disguise or \"spoof\" the name and/or number to appear as though they are calling as a certain person from a specific location.\n\n Wire or money transfer fraud\n \n\nSome scammers trick you into wiring or transferring money to steal from you. One common example of a wire transfer fraud is the “grandparent scam.”",

Phishing scams often involve unsolicited emails or texts that appear to be from reputable sources, such as the IRS or financial institutions, aiming to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information. In the context of food assistance programs, scammers may send unsolicited text messages offering work-at-home opportunities or referencing \"food stamps\" to steal personal information. It is essential to remain vigilant and not share confidential information, like Social Security numbers or EBT card details, with unknown individuals or organizations. If you suspect a scam, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or relevant authorities."
