Small Claims cases are for damages of $10,000 or less. Small Claims is affordable and fast, with simple and informal rules. Attorneys are not allowed.\n\nWhat Is Small Claims Court?\nSmall claims court is a special court where disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively. The rules are simple and informal. The person who sues is the plaintiff. The person who is sued is the defendant. In small claims court, you may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to court, but you cannot have a lawyer in court.\nYour claim cannot be for more than $10,000.00. If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may file a limited civil case, or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over $10,000.00. You cannot, however, file more than two cases in small claims court for more than $2,500.00 each during a calendar year.\nWho Can File a Claim?\nYou must be at least 18 years old to file a claim. If you are not yet 18, you may ask the court to appoint a guardian ad litem. This is a person who will act for you in the case. The guardian ad litem is usually a parent, relative, or an adult friend. A person who sues in small claims court must first make a demand, if possible. This means that you have asked the defendant to pay, and the defendant has refused. If your claim is for possession of property, you must ask the defendant to give you the property.\nUnless you fall within two technical exceptions, you must be the original owner of the claim. This means that if the claim is assigned, the buyer cannot sue in the small claims court. You must also appear at the small claims hearing yourself unless you filed the claim for a corporation or other entity that is not a natural person.",

Learn more \nSmall claims court is only for cases where a person asks for less than $10,000 or $5,000 if the money is owed to a business. If you or your business wants to ask for more, you can ask for the case to be heard in regular civil court. Talk to a Small Claims Advisor to find out more.\n\nDo you have proof?\nYou don’t have to have all your proof together before you sue the other side back. But, you need to know what proof to get to show the other side and bring to your court date.\nExamples of proof (also called evidence) are:\nRepair receipts\nPhotos of damage\nEmails\nBusiness records\n\nExample: bills for repair costs\nSomeone’s car hit your car. They're suing you for damages but you have a police report showing the other driver is at fault. But, you haven’t finished the body work repairs so you don’t have a bill to show how much the other driver owes you. Make sure you have the paid invoice to bring with you to your court hearing.\n\nExample: Pictures of a clean apartment\nYour landlord doesn’t want to return your security deposit and wouldn’t do a walk-through with you when you moved out. They're suing you so you'll pay for damages that cost more than your deposit. In your court case against the landlord you would bring photos of the clean home with timestamps that show when the photos were taken and/or have your friend who saw the clean home come to your court date to talk about it.\n\nYou can use a subpoena to get the proof you need",
