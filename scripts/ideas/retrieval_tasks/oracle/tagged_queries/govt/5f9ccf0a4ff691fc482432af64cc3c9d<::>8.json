They may pose as tax officials or preparers and attempt to steal personal information or encourage the filing of false returns. Additionally, natural disasters or crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can lead to an increase in scams as criminals exploit the situation to deceive people. It's essential to remain vigilant and follow precautions against scams throughout the year, but particularly during these high-risk periods."
