Small Claims cases are for damages of $10,000 or less. Small Claims is affordable and fast, with simple and informal rules. Attorneys are not allowed.\n\nWhat Is Small Claims Court?\nSmall claims court is a special court where disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively. The rules are simple and informal. The person who sues is the plaintiff. The person who is sued is the defendant. In small claims court, you may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to court, but you cannot have a lawyer in court.\nYour claim cannot be for more than $10,000.00. If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may file a limited civil case, or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over $10,000.00. You cannot, however, file more than two cases in small claims court for more than $2,500.00 each during a calendar year.\nWho Can File a Claim?\nYou must be at least 18 years old to file a claim. If you are not yet 18, you may ask the court to appoint a guardian ad litem. This is a person who will act for you in the case. The guardian ad litem is usually a parent, relative, or an adult friend. A person who sues in small claims court must first make a demand, if possible. This means that you have asked the defendant to pay, and the defendant has refused. If your claim is for possession of property, you must ask the defendant to give you the property.\nUnless you fall within two technical exceptions, you must be the original owner of the claim. This means that if the claim is assigned, the buyer cannot sue in the small claims court. You must also appear at the small claims hearing yourself unless you filed the claim for a corporation or other entity that is not a natural person.",
