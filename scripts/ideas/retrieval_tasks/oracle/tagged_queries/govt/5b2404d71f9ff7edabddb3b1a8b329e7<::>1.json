However, if the safe room is located below ground, it may not be suitable for protection during a weapons of mass destruction event. The Red Cross recommends safe rooms for areas prone to tornadoes. It's important not to confuse safe rooms for tornadoes with shelter-in-place rooms. An above-ground safe room with no windows can also be used as a shelter-in-place location. It's important to note that a safe room used for protection from windstorms is different from a room selected for shelter-in-place, although they serve a similar purpose.

If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event. It is best to take immediate protective action as soon as you think there is a local emergency, or if you hear on the radio or television that you need to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n7.\nDo I need to put towels under my door? Should they be wet?\n\r\nWet towels under a door are used in cases when you are in a room from which you can not escape and a fire is on the other side. That is not the same thing as what needs to be done when you shelter-in-place. See the instructions on shelter-in-place on the Red Cross website.\t\n\n8.\nIf I seal off my rooms and vents, how will I breathe? How long should I anticipate being in the room in which I am sheltering-in-place?\n\r\nInstructions to shelter-in-place are usually provided for a matter of hours, not weeks. There is little danger that the room in which you are taking shelter will run out of oxygen and you will suffocate.\t\n\n9.\nIs the bathroom a good room in which to shelter-in-place?",
