The mission's three main science objectives are to understand the nature of the ice shell and the ocean beneath it, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology.

It is covered in a thick crust of frozen water that is estimated to be between 10 to 100 kilometers thick. The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"\n|user|: Who funds the Clipper mission?\n|assistant|: The Europa Clipper mission is funded by NASA, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for civilian space exploration and aeronautics research.

This includes locating their own housing options and paying for their housing. Centers may be able to offer minimal assistance by providing a list of local available housing and/or establishing a private social media group for interns to utilize for relocation planning purposes.\n\n \n\nIs a Letter of Recommendation required?\n\nThe Office of STEM Engagement does not require a letter of recommendation. \n\n \n\nWill I need a car?\n\nYour center location and housing options will determine if you need a car. At most centers, unless you find housing within walking distance, you will most likely need a car. However, there are ample public transportation options at some centers\n\n \n\nI'm not a science or engineering student. Can I still get an internship at NASA?\n\nYes! Interns may support a variety of business and program management work, including human resources, administration and program analysis, accounting and budget, communication and public relations, procurement and contracts, information technology, security, and education. No matter your academic major, you’ll find that NASA is a place where you’ll belong to a supportive community that values your background, perspective, and life experiences.\n\n \n\nMy Path to NASA\n\nAstronauts are often the face of NASA, but our workforce is made up of all kinds of professionals.
