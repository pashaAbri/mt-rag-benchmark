    "text": "The Court of Appeal's judgment usually includes costs on appeal. In most instances, if a party prevails on appeal, they can request the other party to cover their court costs. In some cases, the winning party may also request the other party to cover their attorney fees. - After the court issues a remittitur (the final step in an appeal), the prevailing party can file a memorandum of costs in the trial court. The trial court will handle the request and notify the parties about the next steps. - If the parties have questions regarding reimbursement of appeal costs, they can contact the trial court. There are fees in both the trial court and the Court of Appeal during an appeal. If you wish to have your fees waived in both courts, you must obtain a fee waiver.",

        "text": "Court Opinion – California Appellate Courts\nsend the case back to the trial court for a new trial or hearing\ndismiss the appeal if it was not filed on time, if there is not an appealable order, or if there is a procedural default (like failure to file a brief or pay a fee)\n\nThe court’s opinion generally also includes information about who may be eligible to have their appeal fees paid by the other party.\nHow the Court Makes a Decision\nThere are three justices at every Court of Appeal. A majority of the justices – or two of the three justices – must agree on a decision.\nWhat’s in the Written Decision\nRegardless of what the Court of Appeal justices decide, they issue an order or opinion in writing. Generally, the court justices must provide an opinion with reasons why they made the decision. The court justices are not required to provide an opinion if they issue an order dismissing the appeal.\nMost often there is one written statement signed by all of the justices. Sometimes a justice will file an additional opinion. This can either be a concurrence (written by a justice who agrees with the decision) or a dissent (written by a justice who does not agree with the decision).\nHow the Court Notifies the Parties\nWhen the Court of Appeal makes a decision, the court clerk sends notice of the court’s opinion or order to all parties in the case. If a party does not have a lawyer, the court sends notice to the party. If a party has a lawyer, the court sends notice to their lawyer.\nAsking for Reimbursement of Court Costs\nThe Court of Appeal’s opinion usually awards costs on appeal.\nIn most cases, a party who wins an appeal can ask the other party to pay for their court costs. In some cases, a party who wins may also be able to ask the other party to pay for their attorney fees.\nAfter the court issues a remittitur (the final step in an appeal), the winning party can file a memorandum of costs in the trial court. The trial court will process the request and send notice to the parties about next steps. If the parties have questions about reimbursement of appeal costs, they can contact the trial court.",
