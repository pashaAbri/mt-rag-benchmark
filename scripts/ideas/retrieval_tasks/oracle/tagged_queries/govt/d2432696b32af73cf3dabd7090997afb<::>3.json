    "text": "The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter.",

        "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe self-destruct maneuver would have satisfied NASA’s planetary protection requirements, avoiding any chance Juno could crash into the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, or Callisto – ocean worlds, with Europa in particular considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth – and contaminate them with microscopic life from Earth.  The Cassini mission, orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017, prompted similar concerns – protecting the integrity of Saturn’s moons Enceladus and Titan, also believed to contain possibly habitable environments. As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end. The same fate befell NASA’s Galileo orbiter – Juno’s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.  With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno’s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter’s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere. Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA’s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system’s largest planet. And Juno’s work continues building on the discoveries of previous missions that visited Jupiter – Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 in the 1970s, then the Galileo orbiter and its atmospheric probe, as well as those spacecraft who made key observations while en route to other targets (Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons). In turn, Juno is also preparing the way for future visitors, such as ESA’s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The atmospheric entry probe carried by Galileo was developed by NASA Ames Research Center. The probe entered the Jovian atmosphere on Dec. 7, 1995, measuring the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere until it was crushed, as expected, by extreme pressure. The Galileo orbiter lasted until September 2003, when JPL ordered it to plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere to ensure that it would not crash into, and contaminate, any of Jupiter's moons. Among other things, Galileo found a water ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet, and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.JPL branches outThe downturn in planetary exploration funding during the 1970s had one welcome consequence: JPL began to seek other kinds of spaceflight tasks. This led the Lab into astronomy and Earth science.One of JPL's technology development efforts in the mid-1970s had been research on improving charge-coupled detectors (CCDs) for use in space. This work was intended for the Galileo camera system, but also resulted in the Laboratory being awarded the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera in 1978. Intended to be the observatory's primary imaging instrument, WFPC operated flawlessly when the telescope was finally launched in 1990.WFPC also helped pinpoint a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's primary mirror. It had been polished to just slightly the wrong shape. The error made Hubble a hugely expensive laughing stock shortly after launch, but JPL scientists realized they could rescue the mission by installing corrective optics in an updated camera. JPL developed the camera, WFPC2, which was installed on Hubble by astronauts in 1993, and operated until removed during a servicing mission in 2009.",

The orbiter will be the sixth spacecraft to explore the Jovian magnetosphere, but the first to be placed into orbit around the giant planet. Scientific objectives addressed by the orbiter are to: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n\nThe structure of the orbiter is divided into two sections. The main body of the spacecraft, comprised of the electronics bays, propellant system, RTG and science booms, and high-gain antenna, rotates at rates of 3.25 or 10.5 rpm. The despun section, aft of the main body, uses an electric motor to drive it counter to the rotation of the main section. This dual spin attitude control system accommodates instruments which require stable, accurate pointing (the imaging instruments) and those which benefit from repetitive, broad-angular coverage (the various particles and fields instruments). The length of the spacecraft is 9 m and, with the high-gain antenna (HGA) deployed, is 4.6 m in diameter.\n\nPower is provided to the spacecraft through the use of two radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs), each of which is located at the end of a short boom. The magnetometer sensors and plasma wave antenna are located on yet another boom, 10.9 m in length.",

    "original_text": "The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet and its moons. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence suggesting the existence of a subsurface ocean on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. This discovery has led to further interest in the potential for life beyond Earth. Additionally, Galileo studied Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetosphere, and rings, as well as its moons, including Io, Ganymede, and Callisto. It provided valuable information about their composition, geology, and interactions with Jupiter. However, it is worth noting that the Galileo mission ended when the spacecraft was deliberately crashed into Jupiter in order to avoid any potential contamination of the planet's moons with microscopic life from Earth."
