This is called a partial eclipse and might look as if a bite has been taken out of the Sun. It is important to keep your eclipse glasses on during all parts of the partial solar eclipse. The visible part of the Sun is tens of thousands of times brighter than what you see during totality. You can also use a pinhole camera to view the eclipse. An approximately 115-mile-wide strip known as the path of totality is where the shadow of the Moon, or umbra, will fall on Earth. Inside this path, totality will be visible starting about 65 to 75 minutes after the eclipse begins. If you are in the path of totality, it is safe to take off your eclipse glasses and look at the total eclipse only during totality. Be sure to put your glasses back on before the total phase ends and the surface of the Sun becomes visible again. Your viewing location during the eclipse will determine how long you can see the eclipse in totality. In the U.S., viewers can expect to see 3.5 to 5.5 minutes of totality. After totality ends, a partial eclipse will continue for 60 to 80 minutes, ending when the edge of the Moon moves off of the disk of the Sun. For more information about the start of the partial eclipse, the start and duration of totality, and the percentage of the Sun eclipsed outside the path of totality, find your location on this eclipse map. On April 8, NASA Television will host a live broadcast featuring expert commentary and views from telescopes along the path of totality.

Remember to also use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun. The only time during a solar eclipse when it’s safe to look at the Sun without eclipse glasses is during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face. Ask an adult for help looking at the Sun.\n\nTotal solar eclipses happen somewhere around the world about once a year. But because the Moon casts a fairly small shadow, these eclipses can only be seen from a small area on Earth each time.\nOther things can also pass between us and the Sun and block some of its light. When this happens, it is called a transit. Different things like planets, comets, spacecraft, and even birds can transit the Sun.\n\nHow to Play\nThe goal of this game is to snap photos of eclipses and objects that transit the Sun. Here’s how to play on your desktop:\n\nUse your cursor to center on objects passing in front of the Sun.\nPress the spacebar to take a picture.\nTo take a close-up picture you can zoom in and out using your laptop trackpad or scroll wheel on your mouse, or by pressing the W and S buttons on your keyboard.\nTo change the camera filter and get a different view of the Sun, press the A and D keys.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nSince the Sun is very bright, transiting objects look like dark shapes. During the game, you might notice some objects are bigger than others. That’s because the objects are different sizes and different distances from you. Objects that are far away, like Mercury, look smaller — even though Mercury is an entire planet that’s even larger than the Moon. Objects that are closer to Earth – or even in Earth’s atmosphere, like a plane – look bigger. Here are some examples from the real world:\n\nMercury can be seen crossing the face of the Sun at the bottom of this picture.

        "text": "Five Tips from NASA for Photographing a Total Solar Eclipse - NASA\nTo take images when the Sun is partially eclipsed, you’ll need to use a special solar filter to protect your camera, just as you’ll need a pair of solar viewing glasses (also called eclipse glasses) to protect your eyes. However, at totality, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun, make sure to remove the filter so you can see the Sun’s outer atmosphere – the corona.\n#2 – Any Camera Is a Good Camera\nTaking a stunning photo has more to do with the photographer than the camera. Whether you have a high-end DLSR or a camera phone, you can take great photos during the eclipse; after all, the best piece of equipment you can have is a good eye and a vision for the image you want to create. If you don’t have a telephoto zoom lens, focus on taking landscape shots and capture the changing environment.\nHaving a few other pieces of equipment can also come in handy during the eclipse. Using a tripod can help you stabilize the camera and avoid taking blurry images when there is low lighting. Additionally, using a delayed shutter release timer will allow you to snap shots without jiggling the camera.\n\nPeople watch a partial eclipse in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on March 20, 2015.\nCredits: Robin Cordiner\n\n#3 – Look Up, Down, All Around\nWhile the Sun is the most commanding element of a solar eclipse, remember to look around you. As the Moon slips in front of the Sun, the landscape will be bathed in eerie lighting and shadows. As light filters through the overlapping leaves of trees, it creates natural pinholes that project miniature eclipse replicas on the ground. Anywhere you can point your camera can yield exceptional imagery, so be sure to compose some wide-angle photos that can capture your eclipse experience.\nNASA photographer Bill Ingalls recommends focusing on the human experience of watching the eclipse. “The real pictures are going to be of the people around you pointing, gawking, and watching it,” Ingalls noted. “Those are going to be some great moments to capture to show the emotion of the whole thing.”\n#4 – Practice\nBe sure you know the capabilities of your camera before eclipse day.",

Visit the NASA Eclipse website for more information on safe eclipse viewing. When following proper safety guidelines, witnessing an eclipse is an unparalleled experience. Many “eclipse chasers” have been known to travel the world to see solar eclipses. Here's what to expect on April 8, 2024: The start time and visibility of the eclipse will depend on your location. You can use the interactive map below to find detailed eclipse information, including timing and coverage, by entering in your location. A list of some of the cities and start times along the path of totality is available on the NASA Science website. Explore when and where to view the eclipse with this interactive map from NASA. Enter your zip code to see what will be visible in your viewing location and when to watch. Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio The eclipse begins when the edge of the Moon first crosses in front of the disk of the Sun. This is called a partial eclipse and might look as if a bite has been taken out of the Sun. It is important to keep your eclipse glasses on during all parts of the partial solar eclipse. The visible part of the Sun is tens of thousands of times brighter than what you see during totality. You can also use a pinhole camera to view the eclipse. An approximately 115-mile-wide strip known as the path of totality is where the shadow of the Moon, or umbra, will fall on Earth. Inside this path, totality will be visible starting about 65 to 75 minutes after the eclipse begins. If you are in the path of totality, it is safe to take off your eclipse glasses and look at the total eclipse only during totality. Be sure to put your glasses back on before the total phase ends and the surface of the Sun becomes visible again. Your viewing location during the eclipse will determine how long you can see the eclipse in totality. In the U.S., viewers can expect to see 3.5 to 5.5 minutes of totality.",

    "original_text": "To safely view a solar eclipse, you will need solar viewing or \"eclipse\" glasses, which are much darker than regular sunglasses and block most of the Sun's light. It is also recommended to use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun. The only time it is safe to look directly at the Sun without eclipse glasses is during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun's bright face. However, you should always ask an adult for help looking at the Sun."
