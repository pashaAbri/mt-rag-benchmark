        "text": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits\nThere are essentially three types of Earth orbits: high Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, and low Earth orbit. Many weather and some communications satellites tend to have a high Earth orbit, farthest away from the surface. Satellites that orbit in a medium (mid) Earth orbit include navigation and specialty satellites, designed to monitor a particular region. Most scientific satellites, including NASA’s Earth Observing System fleet, have a low Earth orbit.\n\nOne way of classifying orbits is by altitude. Low Earth orbit starts just above the top of the atmosphere, while high Earth orbit begins about one tenth of the way to the moon. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon)\n\nThe height of the orbit, or distance between the satellite and Earth’s surface, determines how quickly the satellite moves around the Earth. An Earth-orbiting satellite’s motion is mostly controlled by Earth’s gravity. As satellites get closer to Earth, the pull of gravity gets stronger, and the satellite moves more quickly. NASA’s Aqua satellite, for example, requires about 99 minutes to orbit the Earth at about 705 kilometers up, while a weather satellite about 36,000 kilometers from Earth’s surface takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds to complete an orbit. At 384,403 kilometers from the center of the Earth, the Moon completes a single orbit in 28 days.\n\nThe higher a satellite’s orbit, the slower it moves. Certain orbital altitudes have special properties, like a geosynchronous orbit, in which a satellite travels around the Earth exactly once each day. The length of each red arrow in this diagram represents the distance traveled by a satellite in an hour. View animation. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon.)\n\nChanging a satellite’s height will also change its orbital speed. This introduces a strange paradox. If a satellite operator wants to increase the satellite’s orbital speed, he can’t simply fire the thrusters to accelerate the satellite. Doing so would boost the orbit (increase the altitude), which would slow the orbital speed. Instead, he must fire the thrusters in a direction opposite to the satellite’s forward motion, an action that on the ground would slow a moving vehicle.",

    "original_text": "I'm assuming you're asking about the difference between High Earth Orbit (Molniya orbit), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\n- High Earth Orbit (Molniya orbit): This is a highly eccentric orbit with a high inclination (63.4°) designed to maximize viewing time over high latitudes. A satellite in this orbit spends about two-thirds of its 12-hour period over one hemisphere, making it suitable for communications in the far north or south.\n- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): This orbit is closer to the Earth and moves more quickly than LEO. A notable MEO is the semi-synchronous orbit used by GPS satellites, which is nearly circular and about 20,200 kilometers above the Earth's surface. Satellites in this orbit take 12 hours to complete an orbit and pass over the same two spots on the equator every day.\n- Low Earth Orbit (LEO): This is a nearly circular orbit close to the Earth, with an altitude typically below 2,000 kilometers. Most scientific satellites and many weather satellites are in LEO. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, for example, has a low orbital inclination (35°) to focus on monitoring rainfall in the tropics. Another type of LEO is a nearly polar orbit, where the satellite moves around the Earth from pole to pole, taking about 99 minutes to complete an orbit.\nPlease let me know if you need more information on any of these orbits."
