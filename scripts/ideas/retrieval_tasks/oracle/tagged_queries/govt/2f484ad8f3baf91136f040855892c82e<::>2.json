Exploring this ocean world with our Europa Clipper spacecraft could provide new clues in our search for life beyond Earth. Scheduled to launch in October 2024, Europa Clipper’s main science goal is to determine whether there are places below the surface of Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life. Credit: NASA\n\nJupiter’s moon Europa shows strong evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust. Beyond Earth, Europa is considered one of the most promising currently habitable environments in our solar system. \nBelow Europa’s icy surface, evidence suggests there is a global ocean with more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined. Europa could have all the “ingredients” needed for life as we know it: \n\nWater: Twice as much as Earth’s oceans \n\nOrganics: Essential chemical building blocks from a variety of sources\n\nEnergy: Chemical energy sources from the surface and the sea floor\n\nStability: Conditions remaining similar for 4 billion years\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will perform approximately 50 close flybys of the moon, gathering detailed measurements to investigate whether the moon could have conditions suitable for life.

The main body of the spacecraft consists of its avionics vault, radiofrequency module, and propulsion module.Read MoreWorkers use a crane to lift Europa Clipper's high-gain antenna as they prepare to install it on the spacecraft on Aug. 14, 2023. NASA/JPL-CaltechWhy Europa?The search for life beyond Earth is one of NASA’s primary objectives. If humans are to truly understand our place in the universe, we must learn whether our planet is the only place where life exists. So the search is on! There is strong evidence Jupiter's moon Europa has a saltwater ocean that may be one of the best places to look for environments where life could exist beyond Earth.Read MoreThis view of Jupiter’s icy moon Europa was captured by the JunoCam imager aboard NASA’s Juno spacecraft during the mission’s close flyby on Sept. 29, 2022.",
