Nearly everyone in any city around the world is exposed to air that has harmful levels of air pollution,\" said Anenberg, a member of NASA’s Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences team. For areas with little to no ground-based pollution monitoring, the data from Anenberg and colleagues may be the first that local officials have regarding the impacts of air pollution in their cities.",

The team plans to continue working with local stakeholders and governments to help them interpret the data.\n“Even cities with ground monitors can benefit from this information because the monitors can be sparsely located and may not cover the entire urban area,” Anenberg said. The team next plans to apply their methodology and satellite data to examine trends over time for other pollutants, including ozone.\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Joshua Stevens, using data courtesy of Southerland, V.

    "original_text": "Groundwater pollution or contamination refers to the presence of harmful substances, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze, in groundwater. This occurs when these products are disposed of improperly and seep into the ground, contaminating the water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments beneath the Earth's surface. Cleaning up contaminated groundwater can be a time-consuming and expensive process, so preventing contamination in the first place is crucial. The City of Monterey Park Water System obtains its water from local groundwater, specifically 12 City-owned wells with a total capacity of 20 million gallons per day (mgd), reaching depths of up to 1,800 feet and located near the Rio Hondo, outside the city limits, in the Main San Gabriel groundwater basin."
