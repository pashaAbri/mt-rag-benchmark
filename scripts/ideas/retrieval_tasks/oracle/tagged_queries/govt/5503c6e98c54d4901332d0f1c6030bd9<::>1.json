Its main job is to produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere where less than 1% as much air on the surface as on Earth is present.  It will test a way for future explorers to produce oxygen for burning fuel and breathing.

        "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThe \"solid oxide\" in a solid oxide electrolyzer cell is a ceramic made mostly of zirconia that is heated to 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius) inside a special miniature oven. When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours. The rover batteries have enough available charge left to make oxygen for about an hour after that. During that hour, we sometimes change the voltage or the compressor speed to learn more about the instrument.\nWhen MOXIE runs, very little else gets done on Perseverance. There isn't enough power left to drive, or to abrade rocks, or even to run the other instruments for very long. So MOXIE doesn't run very often, maybe once every one or two months.\n\nWhat do we hope to learn from MOXIE?\n\nMOXIE's main job is to show that we can rely on this technology to keep future crews of astronauts alive and return them home safely. That's a tall order. But more than that, we hope to learn a lot of technical details about how to build that much larger future MOXIE system. For that purpose, we include in MOXIE lots of sensors and controls that help us learn about how well MOXIE is doing and how to make it better.\n\nWhat would a full-size MOXIE look like?\n\nEarth and Mars line up for a trip every 26 months. When we send an astronaut crew to Mars, one idea is to send all the things they'll need – a place to live, rovers, a power plant, and maybe a \"Big MOXIE\" – on one launch opportunity, then send the astronauts on the next opportunity, 26 months later. If we do that, then the base would be in place for about 20 months before the astronauts start their trip. The goal of a Big MOXIE would be to make and store all the oxygen that the astronaut and their rocket would need for their mission before they even launch. That means the Big MOXIE would need to make 2,000 to 3,000 grams of oxygen per hour, compared to the 6-10 grams that the current MOXIE is making.",

        "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThat destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called – coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there – on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity.",

        "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using — whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank. The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'\nFuel needs oxygen to burn—for example, on Earth, oxygen is constantly being converted to carbon dioxide by animals, or fires, or other chemical reactions. Plants and trees use water and sunlight to convert the carbon dioxide back to oxygen, replenishing the air. On Mars, MOXIE also makes oxygen from carbon dioxide, about as much as a modest-sized tree, though using a very different process.\n\nMOXIE is a Scale Model for a Future Big MOXIE\nTo launch from Mars, a small crew of human explorers will need 25 to 30 tons of oxygen, or about the weight of a tractor-trailer! To make that much oxygen would require a 25,000 to 30,000 watt power plant. The Perseverance power system only provides about 100 watts, so MOXIE can only make a small fraction of the oxygen that a future \"Big MOXIE\" would need to make.\n\nMOXIE is a 'Tech Demo'\nNASA uses technical demonstrations, or tech demos, when it's not enough to just test a critical technology in the laboratory and it needs to be proven on an actual mission.\n\nWhere Is MOXIE Located?\n\nMichael Hecht\nPrincipal Investigator\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\nDid You Know?\nMOXIE uses a device called an \"electrolyzer\" to make oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the air. An electrolyzer is a close cousin to a fuel cell, which is a device we use to directly make electricity from fuel and oxygen. You can think of MOXIE as a fuel cell running in reverse. \n\nFor Scientists\nNASA is preparing for human exploration of Mars, and the MOXIE investigation on the Mars 2020 mission aims to address key knowledge gaps.\nRead More ›",
