The server must be over 18 and not be one \r\n of the parties protected by the restraining order. Once service is complete, the person who served the papers must complete a Proof of Personal Service (CH-200).\r\n \n\r\n For more information and the necessary forms, see the \r\n \tCivil Harassment Restraining Order: Instructions on Service (Step 2) Packet (CV\\E-CH-02).\r\n \n\nWhat if I can't get the restraining order served in time for the hearing or I need\r\n \ta continuance?\n\r\n \tYou can ask the court to \"continue\" the hearing on your Civil Harassment Restraining Order\r\n \tto another date.
