Case management includes help securing VA and other benefits such as educational aid and financial planning. SSVF is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nMore Information\n\nSupportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF)\n\nHomeless Providers Grant and Per Diem (GPD) Program\nState, local and tribal governments and nonprofits receive capital grants and per diem payments to develop and operate transitional housing and/or service centers for Veterans who are homeless.\nHow It Works\nVA funds over 12,000 beds for eligible Veterans. Grantees work closely with an assigned liaison from the local VAMC. The VA GPD liaison monitors the services the grantees offer to Veterans and provides direct assistance to them. Grantees also collaborate with community-based organizations to connect Veterans with employment, housing and additional social services to promote housing stability. The maximum stay in this housing is up to 24 months, with the goal of moving Veterans into permanent housing. \nMore Information\n\nGrant and Per Diem (GPD)\n\nDomiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV) Program\nThis program encompasses residential care for sheltered and unsheltered Veterans with multiple challenges, illnesses or rehabilitative care needs. DCHV provides a structured setting to foster Veterans’ independence and mutual support.\nHow It Works\nEither on VAMC grounds or in the community, participating Veterans receive interdisciplinary clinical care that includes medical, psychiatric, vocational, educational or social services.",
