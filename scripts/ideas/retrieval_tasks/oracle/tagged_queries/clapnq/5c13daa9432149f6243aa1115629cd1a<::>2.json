This can be caused by various factors such as aplastic anemia, malignancies like multiple myeloma, congenital defects , autoimmune diseases, infections like tuberculosis, leukemia, or exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. Symptoms of a malfunctioning bone marrow can include fatigue, increased risk of infection, and easy bruising or bleeding. In the case of sickle cell disease, the bone marrow's attempt to compensate for the destruction of red cells is not sufficient, leading to anemia.",

In birds and mammals , bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis . It is composed of hematopoietic cells , marrow adipose tissue , and supportive stromal cells . On average , bone marrow constitutes 4 % of the total body mass of humans ; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass ( 143 lb ) , bone marrow typically accounts for approximately 2.6 kilograms ( 5.7 lb ) . Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day , which join the systemic circulation via permeable vasculature sinusoids within the medullary cavity . All types of hematopoietic cells , including both myeloid and lymphoid lineages , are created in bone marrow ; however , lymphoid cells must migrate to other lymphoid organs ( e.g. thymus ) in order to complete maturation .",
