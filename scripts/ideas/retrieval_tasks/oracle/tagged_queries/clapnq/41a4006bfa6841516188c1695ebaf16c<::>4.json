After several weeks of civil unrest , the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin . Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall , joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere . Over the next few weeks , euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall ; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of what was left . The `` fall of the Berlin Wall '' paved the way for German reunification , which formally took place on 3 October 1990 .",

The guards often let fugitives bleed to death in the middle of this ground , as in the most notorious failed attempt , that of Peter Fechter ( aged 18 ) . He was shot and bled to death , in full view of the Western media , on 17 August 1962 . Fechter 's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places , and provide medical care for possible `` would - be escapers '' . The last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989 , while the final person to die in an escape attempt was Winfried Freudenberg who was killed when his homemade natural gas - filled balloon crashed on 8 March 1989 .",

Before the Wall was built, 3.5 million East Germans had already defected from the GDR, many by crossing the border between East and West Berlin. However, after the Wall was erected in 1961, it became much more difficult to escape. Despite this, over 100,000 people attempted to escape and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall between 1961 and 1989. The methods used to escape included tunneling under the Wall, climbing over it, or using false papers to cross through checkpoints. However, these attempts often came with significant risks, and an estimated 136 to over 200 people died in and around Berlin while trying to cross the Wall."
