Nevertheless, Vaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses . They were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses . Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity ( illness ) and mortality ( death ) associated with viral infections such as polio , measles , mumps and rubella . In fact, Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals .                                            \n|user|: Can you tell me the greatest pandemics worldwide before  COVID in 2020?\n|assistant|: Yes. We have some pandemics that affected the world before COVID . The 1918 flu pandemic , which lasted until 1919 , was a category 5 influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus . The victims were healthy young adults , in contrast to most influenza outbreaks , which predominantly affect juvenile , elderly , or otherwise - weakened patients . Older estimates say it killed 40 -- 50 million people , while more recent research suggests that it may have killed as many as 100 million people , or 5 % of the world 's population in 1918 ; Bubonic plague Also known as the modern pandemic , the third pandemic spread the disease to port cities throughout the world in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century via shipping routes . The plague inflicted people in Chinatown in San Francisco from 1900 - 1904 , and the people of Oakland and east bay again from 1907 - 1909 . In 1994, Zimbabwe suffered outbreaks of acute diseases like plague; In July of 2014, West African had the Ebola virus epidemic; In 2001 the Bubonic plague affected Zambia , India , Malawi , Algeria , China , Peru , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .    A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the then Director - General Margaret Chan in April 2009 .                  \n|user|: What about HIV pandemic? did it kill many people?\n|assistant|: Yes, the HIV pandemic has also had a significant impact globally. According to UNAIDS, as of 2020, approximately 38 .6 million people are living with HIV worldwide, and there have been around 25 million AIDS- it was first recognized on 5 June 1981 , making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history . It was estimated that in  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  about 1.1 % of adults aged 15 -- 49 were living with HIV / AIDS .    According to the 2015 UNAIDS Report , South Africa has an estimated 7 million people living with HIV -- more than any other country in the world . A 2008 study revealed that HIV / AIDS infection in South Africa is distinctly divided along racial lines : 13.6 % of blacks are HIV - positive , whereas only 0.3 % of whites have the disease . Most deaths are experienced by economically active individuals , resulting in many AIDS orphans who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support                                     \n|user|: How did  HIV originated and where did start the first cases?\n|assistant|: The origin of HIV is still a matter of debate among scientists, but it is believed originated in sub-Saharan ,Southeast Cameroon , Africa , through exposure to infected blood and body fluids while butchering bushmeat during the 20th century  but  symptomatic infections were not reported until the 1980s. AIDS was at first considered a disease of gay men and drug addicts and the virus spread primarily by sexual contact. In Africa it took off among the general population . IDS became a significant problem for the region , particularly in Côte d'Ivoire , Liberia , and Nigeria . The onset of the HIV epidemic in the region began in 1985 with reported cases in Benin and Nigeri , and in nearby countries , such as Côte d'Ivoire , in subsequent years .\n|user|: Is there a cure for HIV?\n|assistant|: With proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. It was reported in  October 2011 that  the anti-HIV drug tenofovir , when used topically in a microbicidal vaginal gel  reduce herpes virus sexual transmission by 51 % . Also  a genetic approach involving intrabodies that block CCR5 expression has been proposed as a treatment for HIV - 1 infected individuals . Some good results were reported in 2014 when enrollment of HIV - positive patients in a clinical trial was started in 2009 in which the patients ' cells were genetically modified with a zinc finger nuclease to carry the CCR5 - Δ32 trait and then reintroduced into the body as a potential HIV treatment .\n|user|: Is Herpes a lethal disease and how is it transmitted?\n|assistant|: Herpes is not generally considered a lethal disease .There are two types of herpes simplex virus , type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) and type 2 ( HSV - 2 ) . HSV - 1 more commonly causes infections around the mouth while HSV - 2 more commonly causes genital infections.Herpes simplex Herpes is contracted through direct contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person . Herpes transmission occurs between discordant partners ; a person with a history of infection ( HSV seropositive ) can pass the virus to an HSV seronegative person . Herpes simplex virus 2 is typically contracted through direct skin - to - skin contact with an infected individual , but can also be contracted by exposure to infected saliva , semen , vaginal fluid , or the fluid from herpetic blisters . Herpes simplex However , asymptomatic carriers of the HSV - 2 virus are still contagious . In many infections , the first symptom people will have of their own infections is the horizontal transmission to a sexual partner or the vertical transmission of neonatal herpes to a newborn at term . Since most asymptomatic individuals are unaware of their infection , they are considered at high risk for spreading HSV .\n|user|: Is there a vaccine for Herper, how can it be prevent?\n|assistant|: Currently, there is no available vaccine  and there is no cure  for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) but Herpes simplex research has gone into vaccines for both prevention and treatment of herpes infections . Nevertheless the most effective method to avoid to get Herpes simplex  is  avoiding vaginal , oral , and anal sex . The use of Condom  decreases the risk somewhat . Daily antiviral medication taken by someone who has the infection can also reduce spread . e . Paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) and topical lidocaine may be used to help with the symptoms . Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes .\n|user|: Speaking about vaccines, how are they made?"

During the outbreak from 1900 - 1904 in San Francisco is when authorities made permanent the Chinese Exclusion Act . This law was originally signed into existence by President Chester A. Arthur in 1882 . The Chinese Exclusion Act was supposed to last for ten years but was renewed in 1892 with the Geary Act and subsequently made permanent in 1902 during the outbreak of plague in Chinatown , San Francisco . The last major outbreak in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924 , though the disease is still present in wild rodents , and can be passed to humans that come in contact with them . According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was considered active until 1959 , when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year . In 1994 , a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections ( including 52 deaths ) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague .",

    "original_text": "Vaccines can be made using different methods depending on the type of vaccine being produced. Here are the three main types and how they are made:\n1. Live-attenuated vaccines: These vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus that do not cause the disease but still stimulate an immune response. They are created by growing the virus in cultures or cells and then reducing its virulence through various methods such as temperature changes or chemical treatments.\n2. Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain viruses that have been killed using chemicals or heat. While they cannot cause the disease, they can still stimulate an immune response. They are made by growing the virus in cultures or cells and then treating it with a chemical or heat to kill it.\n3. Subunit vaccines: These vaccines contain only the parts of the virus that are necessary to stimulate an immune response, such as the capsid proteins. They are made using biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques. For example, the hepatitis B vaccine is made using recombinant DNA technology, where the gene for the virus's surface antigen is inserted into yeast cells, which then produce the antigen.\nOverall, vaccines are a crucial tool in preventing infectious diseases and saving lives."
