Over 100,000 arrests were made , mass fines were levied and demonstrators were subjected to public flogging . Hundreds of civilians were killed in violence many shot by the police army . Many national leaders went underground and continued their struggle by broadcasting messages over clandestine radio stations , distributing pamphlets and establishing parallel governments . The British sense of crisis was strong enough that a battleship was specifically set aside to take Gandhi and the Congress leaders out of India , possibly to South Africa or Yemen but ultimately did not take that step out of fear of intensifying the revolt .",

The British , already alarmed by the advance of the Japanese army to the India - Burma border , responded by imprisoning Gandhi . All the members of the Party 's Working Committee ( national leadership ) were imprisoned as well . Due to the arrest of major leaders , a young and until then relatively unknown Aruna Asaf Ali presided over the AICC session on 9 August and hoisted the flag ; later the Congress party was banned . These actions only created sympathy for the cause among the population . Despite lack of direct leadership , large protests and demonstrations were held all over the country . Workers remained absent en masse and strikes were called . Not all demonstrations were peaceful , at some places bombs exploded , government buildings were set on fire , electricity was cut and transport and communication lines were severed . Play",
