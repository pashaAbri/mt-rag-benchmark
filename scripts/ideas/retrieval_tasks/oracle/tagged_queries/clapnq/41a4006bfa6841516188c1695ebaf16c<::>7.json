After several weeks of civil unrest , the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin . Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall , joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere . Over the next few weeks , euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall ; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of what was left . The `` fall of the Berlin Wall '' paved the way for German reunification , which formally took place on 3 October 1990 .",

        "text": "History of Germany (1945–90)\nIn the 1969 election , the SPD -- headed by Willy Brandt -- gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP . Although Chancellor for only just over four years , Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period . Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after Günter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi . Brandt 's contributions to world peace led to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 1971 . U.S.",

Berlin soon went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult . Many families were split , while East Berliners employed in the West were cut off from their jobs . West Berlin became an isolated exclave in a hostile land . West Berliners demonstrated against the Wall , led by their Mayor ( Oberbürgermeister ) Willy Brandt , who strongly criticized the United States for failing to respond . Allied intelligence agencies had hypothesized about a wall to stop the flood of refugees , but the main candidate for its location was around the perimeter of the city . In 1961 , Secretary of State Dean Rusk proclaimed , `` The Wall certainly ought not to be a permanent feature of the European landscape . I see no reason why the Soviet Union should think it is -- it is to their advantage in any way to leave there that monument to communist failure . ''",
