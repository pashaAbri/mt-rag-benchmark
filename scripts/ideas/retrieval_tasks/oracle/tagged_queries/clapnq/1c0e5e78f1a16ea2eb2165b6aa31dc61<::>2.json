        "text": "The Office (U.S. season 9)\nIn a conference call with reporters on August 21 , 2012 , Daniels announced that this would be the final season of the series . Daniels said , `` This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off a lot of the stuff that matters most to fans . '' Daniels also said all the questions would be answered , such as who was behind the documentary , and why they had been filming it for so long , as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler . A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) and Pete Miller ( Jake Lacy ) . According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine , the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers ; he noted that `` the triangle ( between Andy , Erin , and Pete ) has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room , which tells me even they do n't know at this point which guy Erin will choose . '' Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input , as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin 's characterization . Angela",

        "text": "The Office (U.S. season 9)\nThe ninth season of The Office received moderately positive reviews from television critics . Based on seven critiques , review aggregation website Metacritic gave the ninth season of the show a 64 out of 100 rating , which denotes `` generally favorable reviews '' . Entertainment website Holy Moly named the series one of the best shows during the 2012 -- 13 season , writing that `` this final season of The Office has been great '' largely due to the fact that `` every single relationship in the show rings true with the audience . '' Michael Tedder of Vulture commented that he was `` willing to call it the fourth best season of the show overall , which is by no means faint praise . '' He explained that this was largely due to the fact that the `` final season was a chance to see how everyone else would end up '' . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that `` the tension between Jim and Pam in the final season ended up being highly controversial for a number of reasons ... but it also provided the most hopeful moments of the series ' final stretch '' ( although he did note that it was clear that the writers had `` blatantly '' set up the drama ) . He concluded that the finale was able to successfully return the series `` to what had always been its heart -- to have true fulfillment '' . Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the season an 8.5 out of 10 , denoting a `` great '' year . She felt that the character growth in the final few episodes was particularly well executed , and the last stretch of the season helped raise it after a rocky start ; ultimately , she felt that the writers were able to craft the proper ending for the show . She was , however , critical of Andy 's characterization , noting that he was merely used as a plot device when convenient . Many critics argued that the season was an improvement , in both writing and humor , over the previous season .",

        "text": "The Office (U.S. season 9)\nThe season aired on Thursdays at 9 : 00 p.m. , as part of the Comedy Night Done Right programming block . The season premiere , `` New Guys '' received a 2.1 / 6 percent share in the Nielsen ratings among viewers aged 18 to 49 , meaning that 2.1 percent of viewers aged 18 to 49 watched the episode , and 6 percent of viewers watching television at the time watched the episode . The episode was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and became the lowest - rated season premiere for the series . In addition , it marked a 46 percent drop in viewership from the season eight premiere `` The List '' . For the first sixteen episodes , the series was able to maintain roughly 4 million viewers . However , starting with the seventeenth episode `` The Farm '' , ratings began to drop below this threshold . The series hit an all - time low with the twentieth episode , `` Paper Airplane '' , which was viewed by only 3.25 million viewers , and received a 1.7 rating / 5 percent share . The series finale was viewed by 5.69 million viewers and received a 3.0 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This made it the highest - rated episode of the season ; it also marked an increase in the previous season finale , which garnered only 4.49 million viewers . `` Finale '' was the most watched episode of The Office since the eighth season episode `` Pool Party '' , but ranked as the third - least watched finale of the series , following the eighth - and first - season finales . Although in its ninth season , The Office no longer was NBC 's highest - rated scripted comedy series -- it was surpassed by Go On -- it often ranked as the highest - rated scripted NBC series on Thursday nights . Rainn Wilson argued that the show 's lower ratings were a combination of the overall trend in lower television ratings in 2012 , as well as the fact that `` NBC did n't promote ( the series ) one bit '' . NBC increased their usual ad - price by 200 percent for the finale , asking for $400,000 per commercial . This was largely due to the anticipated increase in viewership that the finale would bring .",
