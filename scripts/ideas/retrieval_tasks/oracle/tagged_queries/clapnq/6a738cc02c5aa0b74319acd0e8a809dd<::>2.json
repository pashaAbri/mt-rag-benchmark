        "text": "Infertility\nThe main cause of male infertility is low semen quality . In men who have the necessary reproductive organs to procreate , infertility can be caused by low sperm count due to endocrine problems , drugs , radiation , or infection . There may be testicular malformations , hormone imbalance , or blockage of the man 's duct system . Although many of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions , some may be indefinite . Infertility associated with viable , but immotile sperm may be caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia . The sperm must provide the zygote with DNA , centrioles , and activation factor for the embryo to develop . A defect in any of these sperm structures may result in infertility that will not be detected by semen analysis . Antisperm antibodies cause immune infertility .",

For example , polycystic ovarian syndrome is when the eggs only partially developed within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones . Some women are infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs . In this case synthetic FSH by injection or Clomid ( Clomiphene citrate ) via a pill can be given to stimulate follicles to mature in the ovaries .",

Infertility may be caused by blockage of the Fallopian tube due to malformations , infections such as chlamydia and / or scar tissue .

Endometriosis is usually more common in women in their mid-twenties and older , especially when postponed childbirth has taken place .",

The documents provided do not include information on how long to consider adoption after experiencing infertility. This decision is often very personal and can depend on many factors. It might be a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider or a counselor who specializes in infertility to discuss your options and the emotional aspects of this decision."
