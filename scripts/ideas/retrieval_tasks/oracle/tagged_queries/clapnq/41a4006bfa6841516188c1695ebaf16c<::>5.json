After several weeks of civil unrest , the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin . Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall , joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere . Over the next few weeks , euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall ; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of what was left . The `` fall of the Berlin Wall '' paved the way for German reunification , which formally took place on 3 October 1990 .",

The guards often let fugitives bleed to death in the middle of this ground , as in the most notorious failed attempt , that of Peter Fechter ( aged 18 ) . He was shot and bled to death , in full view of the Western media , on 17 August 1962 . Fechter 's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places , and provide medical care for possible `` would - be escapers '' . The last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989 , while the final person to die in an escape attempt was Winfried Freudenberg who was killed when his homemade natural gas - filled balloon crashed on 8 March 1989 .",

Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990 , preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany 's Basic Law ( meaning that constitutionally , East Germany was subsumed into West Germany ) ; but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990 , which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990 . These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law ( including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession ) . On 2 December 1990 , all - German elections were held for the first time since 1933 . The `` new '' country stayed the same as the West German legal system and institutions were extended to the east . The unified nation kept the name Bundesrepublik Deutschland ( though the simple ' Deutschland ' would become increasingly common ) and retained the West German `` Deutsche Mark '' for currency as well . Berlin would formally become the capital of the united Germany , but the political institutions remained at Bonn for the time being . Only after a heated 1991 debate did the Bundestag conclude on moving itself and most of the government to Berlin as well , a process that took until 1999 to complete , when the Bundestag held its first session at the reconstructed Reichstag building .
