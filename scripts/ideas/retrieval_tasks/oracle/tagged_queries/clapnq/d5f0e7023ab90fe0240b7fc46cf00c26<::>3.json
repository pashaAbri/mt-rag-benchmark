The upper reaches near Errol , New Hampshire , are popular with local and visiting fly fishermen for the chance to catch landlocked salmon from a drift boat . Although the upper reaches contain some bass , the river warms as it flows into Maine , and smallmouth bass are the chief quarry in its lower reaches .",

Its drainage basin is 3,530 square miles ( 9,100 km ) in area . The name `` Androscoggin '' comes from the Eastern Abenaki term / aləssíkɑntəkw / or / alsíkɑntəkw / , meaning `` river of cliff rock shelters '' ( literally `` thus - deep - dwelling - river '' ) ; or perhaps from Penobscot / aləsstkɑtəkw / , meaning `` river of rock shelters '' . The Anglicization of the Abenaki term is likely an analogical contamination with the colonial governor Edmund Andros .",

However, the Penobscot River does have a significant tributary, the Kenduskeag Stream, which empties into the Penobscot River at Bangor. Additionally, the Ripogenus Dam on the West Branch near Chesuncook Lake plays a crucial role in sustaining the large landlocked salmon population in that section of the river."
