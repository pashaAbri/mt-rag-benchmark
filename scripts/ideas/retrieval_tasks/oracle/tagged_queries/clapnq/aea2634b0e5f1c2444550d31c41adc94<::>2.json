It was introduced by Georgia Representative Bob Barr and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. The Act was intended by Congress to reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. It defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse as a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The bill moved quickly through Congress and was passed by an overwhelming majority in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass DOMA, and on September 10, 1996, 84 Senators voted in favor of DOMA. The Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. However, Section 3 of DOMA, which defined marriage and spouse for federal purposes, was struck down by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, in the case of United States v. Windsor.

Until Section 3 of the Act was struck down in 2013 ( United States v. Windsor ) , DOMA , in conjunction with other statutes , had barred same - sex married couples from being recognized as `` spouses '' for purposes of federal laws , effectively barring them from receiving federal marriage benefits . DOMA 's passage did not prevent individual states from recognizing same - sex marriage , but it imposed constraints on the benefits received by all legally married same - sex couples .",

    "original_text": "According to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as it stood before Section 3 was struck down in 2013, marriage was defined as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife for federal purposes. This definition was used to deny federal recognition to same-sex marriages, which meant that same-sex married couples were not eligible for federal marriage benefits. However, it is important to note that this definition has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As of now, marriage is legally recognized as a union between two consenting adults, regardless of their sex or gender identity, in many jurisdictions around the world."
