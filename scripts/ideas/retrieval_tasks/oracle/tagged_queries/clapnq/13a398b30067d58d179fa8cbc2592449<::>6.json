    "text": "As North Carolina has a great availability of hydroelectric power  and a wide variety of soils , its economy is  very diverse leading the South Atlantic states in industry and agriculture. In fact, the state leads the nation in the production of tobacco , textiles , and furniture. Charlotte , the state 's largest city , is a major textile and trade center. The state 's shipping , commercial fishing , and lumber industries are important to its economy . Service industries , including education , health care , private research , and retail trade , are also important . Research Triangle Park , a large industrial complex located in the Raleigh - Durham area , is one of the major centers in the country for electronics and medical research. However, there has been a clear division in the economic growth of North Carolina 's urban and rural areas . While North Carolina 's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth , low unemployment , and rising wages , many of the state 's rural counties have suffered from job loss , rising levels of poverty , and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. It is important to note that Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by Asheville .",

        "text": "Climate of North Carolina\nSnow in North Carolina is seen on a regular basis in the mountains . North Carolina averages 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of snow a year . However , this also varies greatly across the state . Along the coast , most areas register less than 2 inches ( 51 mm ) per year while the state capital , Raleigh averages 7.5 inches ( 190 mm ) . Farther west in the Piedmont - Triad , the average grows to approximately 9 inches ( 230 mm ) . The Charlotte area averages approximately 6.5 inches ( 170 mm ) . The mountains in the west act as a barrier , preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont . When snow does make it past the mountains , it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days . However , several storms have dropped 18 inches ( 460 mm ) or more of snow within normally warm areas . The 1993 Storm of the Century that lasted from March 11 to March 15 affected locales from Canada to Central America , and brought a significant amount of snow to North Carolina . Newfound Gap received more than 36 inches ( 0.91 m ) of snow with drifts more than 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) , while Mount Mitchell measured over 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) of snow with drifts to 14 feet ( 4.3 m ) . Most of the northwestern part of the state received somewhere between 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) an 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) of snow .",

                    "model_text": "|user|: where does it snow the most in north carolina?\n|assistant|: The mountains in western North Carolina receive the most snow in the state. This is because the Appalachian Mountains act as a barrier, preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont. When snow does make it past the mountains, it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days. However, several storms have dropped 18 inches (460 mm) or more of snow within normally warm areas. For instance, during the 1993 Storm of the Century, most of the northwestern part of the state received somewhere between 2 feet (0.61 m) and 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow. In January of 2000, Raleigh area was hit with more than  20 inches(510 mm) of snow feel. There was also a heavy snowfall totaling 18 inches ( 460 mm ) that hit the Wilmington area on December 22 - 23 , 1989\n|user|: That means North Carolina has most the time tough winters with some much snow. What can you tell me about the  summer months. Are they enyoyable ?\n|assistant|:  I cannot definitively say whether the summer months in North Carolina are enjoyable or not, as relative humidity is highest in the winter suggesting  that the summer months might be less humid.  There is an average of forty - five inches of rain a year ( fifty in the mountains ) . July storms account for much of this precipitation .In fact, North Carolina experience severe weather in  both summer and winter. The summer can bring the threat of hurricanes , tropical storms , heavy rain , and flooding . Indeed Destructive hurricanes that have hit North Carolina include Hurricane Fran , Hurricane Floyd , and Hurricane Hazel , the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state , as a Category 4 in 1954 . Hurricane Isabel ranks as the most destructive of the 21st century .\n|user|: Are you saying the North Carolina can get a lot  hurricane during the summer months?\n|assistant|: That is right. North Carolina, located along the Atlantic Coast, is no stranger to hurricanes and it can experience a significant number of hurricanes during the summer months. Many of them can come up from the Caribbean Sea make it up the coast of eastern America , passing by North Carolina . The state has had destructive hurricanes in the past, such as Hurricane Fran, considered as category 3 hurricane  and caused a huge financial damage ;hurricane Floyd in 1999, which dropped over 24 inches of rainfall in the north of Southport, causing the death of more than 35 people and Hurricane Hazel, which was the strongest storm ever to make landfall in North Carolina as a Category 4 in 1954 and caused 19 deaths and also serious destruction. Additionally, Hurricane Isabel is the most destructive hurricane of the 21st century in the state.\n|user|: As Winter and summer are tough seasons with snow and hurricane, tornadoes, what can you tell me about spring and fall?\n|assistant|: Because the  El Niño  early spring can see  temperatures cooler than average with above average precipitation in the central and eastern parts of the state and drier weather in the western parts. It important to note the Tornadoes are most likely in the spring and the month of May experiences the greatest rise in temperatures . there are warm days and cool nights in the Piedmont during the spring with temperatures  somewhat cooler in the mountains and warmer , particularly at night , near the coast and the humidity is lowest .  In the fall you can see the most rapidly change of temperature, especially in October and November although tropical cyclones remain a threat until late in the season.  Due to the leaves changing color in the trees ,the Appalachian Mountains are frequently visited at this time of year ,\n|user|:  Appalachian Mountains\n|assistant|: The western section of North Carolina is part of the Appalachian Mountain range . Among the subranges of the Appalachians located in the state are the Great Smoky Mountains , Blue Ridge Mountains , which is a specific region of the Appalachians  with the ridgeline of the mountains varying from being 5 to 65 miles wide , with peaks averaging around 2000 to 4000 ft above sea level . The area is covered in forests with hundreds of species of trees found within the range , and today are a source of timber . Additionally we have Black Mountains, considered the  highest in the eastern United States , and culminate in Mount Mitchell at 6,684 feet ( 2,037 m ) , the highest point east of the Mississippi River. In fact, The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest .  Every year the Appalachian Mountains attract several million tourists to the Western part of the state , including the historic Biltmore Estate . The scenic Blue Ridge Parkway and Great Smoky Mountains National Park are the two most visited national park and unit in the United States.  And also the Stone Mountain Stone Mountain is part of the e Appalachian Mountains.\n|user|: What could you tell me overall about North Carollina like its economy ?"

        "text": "Climate of North Carolina\nHeavy rains accompany tropical cyclones and their remnants which move northeast from the Gulf of Mexico coastline , as well as inland from the western subtropical Atlantic ocean . Over the past 30 years , the wettest tropical cyclone to strike the coastal plain was Hurricane Floyd of September 1999 , which dropped over 24 inches ( 610 mm ) of rainfall north of Southport . Unlike Hazel and Fran , the main force of destruction was from precipitation . Before Hurricane Floyd reached North Carolina , the state had already received large amounts of rain from Hurricane Dennis less than two weeks before Floyd . This saturated much of the Eastern North Carolina soil and allowed heavy rains from Hurricane Floyd to turn into floods . Over 35 people died from Floyd . In the mountains , Hurricane Frances of September 2004 was nearly as wet , bringing over 23 inches ( 580 mm ) of rainfall to Mount Mitchell . Tornado",
