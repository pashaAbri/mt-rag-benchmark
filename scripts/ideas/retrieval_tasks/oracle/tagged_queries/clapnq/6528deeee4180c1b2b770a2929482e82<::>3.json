Barley and wheat cultivation -- along with the domestication of cattle , primarily sheep and goats -- followed in Mehrgarh culture by 8,000 -- 6,000 BC . This period also saw the first domestication of the elephant . Pastoral farming in India included threshing , planting crops in rows -- either of two or of six -- and storing grain in granaries . By the 5th millennium BC , agricultural communities became widespread in Kashmir . Irrigation was developed in the Indus Valley Civilization by around 4,500 BC . The size and prosperity of the Indus civilization grew as a result of this innovation , leading to more thoroughly planned settlements which used drainage and sewers . Archeological evidence of an animal - drawn plough dates back to 2,500 BC in the Indus Valley Civilization .",
