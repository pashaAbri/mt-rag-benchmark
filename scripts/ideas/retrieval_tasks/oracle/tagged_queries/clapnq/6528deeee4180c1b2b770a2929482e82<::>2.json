Labour in India Agriculture, dairy, horticulture and related occupations alone employ 52 percent of labour in India. Agriculture and allied sectors accounted for 17% of the GDP and employed 49% of the total workforce in 2014. Additionally, agriculture alone accounted for 23% of GDP and employed 59% of the country's total workforce in 2016. Despite the declining contribution of agriculture to the GDP over the years, it remains the largest employment source in India and plays a significant role in the country's overall socio-economic development.",

Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry , logging and fishing accounted for 17 % of the GDP and employed 49 % of its total workforce in 2014 . Agriculture accounted for 23 % of GDP , and employed 59 % of the country 's total workforce in 2016 . As the Indian economy has diversified and grown , agriculture 's contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2011 , yet it is still the country 's largest employment source and a significant piece of its overall socio - economic development . Crop - yield - per - unit - area of all crops has grown since 1950 , due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five - year plans and steady improvements in irrigation , technology , application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the Green Revolution in India . However , international comparisons reveal the average yield in India is generally 30 % to 50 % of the highest average yield in the world . The states of Uttar Pradesh , Punjab , Haryana , Madhya Pradesh , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , Bihar , West Bengal , Gujarat and Maharashtra are key contributors to Indian agriculture .",

        "text": "Economy of India\nAgriculture is an important part of the Indian economy . At around 1,530,000 square kilometres ( 590,000 sq mi ) , India has the second - largest amount of arable land , after the US , with 52 % of total land under cultivation . Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US , India 's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US , and marginally larger than that of China . However , agricultural output lags far behind its potential . The low productivity in India is a result of several factors . According to the World Bank , India 's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity - enhancing investment . Over-regulation of agriculture has increased costs , price risks and uncertainty , and governmental intervention in labour , land , and credit are hurting the market . Infrastructure such as rural roads , electricity , ports , food storage , retail markets and services remain inadequate . The average size of land holdings is very small , with 70 % of holdings being less than one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) in size . Irrigation facilities are inadequate , as revealed by the fact that only 46 % of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016 , resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall , specifically the monsoon season , which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country . In an effort to bring an additional two crore hectares ( 20 million hectares ; 50 million acres ) of land under irrigation , various schemes have been attempted , including the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme ( AIBP ) which was provided ₹ 80,000 crore ( ₹ 800 billion ) in the union budget . Farming incomes are also hampered by lack of food storage and distribution infrastructure ; a third of India 's agricultural production is lost from spoilage .",
