    "text": "That is right. North Carolina, located along the Atlantic Coast, is no stranger to hurricanes and it can experience a significant number of hurricanes during the summer months. Many of them come from the Caribbean Sea up the coast of eastern America , passing by North Carolina . The state has had destructive hurricanes in the past, such as Hurricane Fran, a category 3 hurricane; hurricane Floyd in 1999, which dropped over 24 inches of rainfall, causing the death of more than 35 people and Hurricane Hazel, which was the strongest storm ever to make landfall in North Carolina as a Category 4 in 1954 causing 19 deaths and serious destruction. Additionally, Hurricane Isabel is the most destructive hurricane of the 21st century in the state.",

        "text": "Climate of North Carolina\nSnow in North Carolina is seen on a regular basis in the mountains . North Carolina averages 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of snow a year . However , this also varies greatly across the state . Along the coast , most areas register less than 2 inches ( 51 mm ) per year while the state capital , Raleigh averages 7.5 inches ( 190 mm ) . Farther west in the Piedmont - Triad , the average grows to approximately 9 inches ( 230 mm ) . The Charlotte area averages approximately 6.5 inches ( 170 mm ) . The mountains in the west act as a barrier , preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont . When snow does make it past the mountains , it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days . However , several storms have dropped 18 inches ( 460 mm ) or more of snow within normally warm areas . The 1993 Storm of the Century that lasted from March 11 to March 15 affected locales from Canada to Central America , and brought a significant amount of snow to North Carolina . Newfound Gap received more than 36 inches ( 0.91 m ) of snow with drifts more than 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) , while Mount Mitchell measured over 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) of snow with drifts to 14 feet ( 4.3 m ) . Most of the northwestern part of the state received somewhere between 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) an 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) of snow .",

This is because the Appalachian Mountains act as a barrier, preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont. When snow does make it past the mountains, it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days. However, several storms have dropped 18 inches (460 mm) or more of snow within normally warm areas. For instance, during the 1993 Storm of the Century, most of the northwestern part of the state received somewhere between 2 feet (0.61 m) and 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow. In January of 2000, Raleigh area was hit with more than  20 inches(510 mm) of snow feel. There was also a heavy snowfall totaling 18 inches ( 460 mm ) that hit the Wilmington area on December 22 - 23 , 1989\n|user|: That means North Carolina has most the time tough winters with some much snow. What can you tell me about the  summer months. Are they enyoyable ?\n|assistant|:  I cannot definitively say whether the summer months in North Carolina are enjoyable or not, as relative humidity is highest in the winter suggesting  that the summer months might be less humid.  There is an average of forty - five inches of rain a year ( fifty in the mountains ) . July storms account for much of this precipitation .In fact, North Carolina experience severe weather in  both summer and winter. The summer can bring the threat of hurricanes , tropical storms , heavy rain , and flooding . Indeed Destructive hurricanes that have hit North Carolina include Hurricane Fran , Hurricane Floyd , and Hurricane Hazel , the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state , as a Category 4 in 1954 .

        "text": "Climate of North Carolina\nAnother significant snowfall hit the Raleigh area in January 2000 when more than 20 inches ( 510 mm ) of snow fell . There was also a heavy snowfall totaling 18 inches ( 460 mm ) that hit the Wilmington area on December 22 - 23 , 1989 . This storm affected only the Southeastern US coast , as far south as Savannah , GA , with little to no snow measured west of I - 95 . Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina . These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level , usually propelled southward from Arctic high pressure over the Northeastern or New England states . If the storms track sufficiently far to the east , snow will be limited to the eastern part of the state ( as with the December 22 - 23 , 1989 storm ) . If the cyclones travel close to the coast , warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean , bringing a rain / snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont , foothills and mountains , as with the January 22 , 1987 storm . If the storm tracks inland into eastern North Carolina , the rain / snow line ranges between Raleigh and Greensboro .",
