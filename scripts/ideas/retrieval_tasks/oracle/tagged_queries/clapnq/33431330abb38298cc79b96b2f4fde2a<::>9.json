Judah was later conquered by the Babylonian , Persian and Hellenistic empires and had existed as Jewish autonomous provinces . The successful Maccabean Revolt led to an independent Jewish kingdom in 110 BCE , which came to an end in 63 BCE when the Hasmonean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Republic that subsequently installed the Herodian dynasty in 37 BCE , and in 6 CE created the Roman province of Judea . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , expulsion of Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the region has persisted to a certain extent over the centuries . In the 7th century the Levant was taken from the Byzantine Empire by the Arabs and remained in Muslim control until the First Crusade of 1099 , followed by the Ayyubid conquest of 1187 . The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt extended its control over the Levant in the 13th century until its defeat by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 . During the 19th century , national awakening among Jews led to the establishment of the Zionist movement in the diaspora followed by waves of immigration to Ottoman and later British Palestine .",

The Roman Empire conquered the area in 63 BC and maintained control until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. The Byzantine Empire, which centered on Constantinople and was oriented towards Greek culture and Orthodox Christianity, continued to exist in the East and controlled parts of the Middle East, including some territories that were once part of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah. However, I do not have specific information about the Byzantine Empire's military campaigns or conquests in the region of Israel."
