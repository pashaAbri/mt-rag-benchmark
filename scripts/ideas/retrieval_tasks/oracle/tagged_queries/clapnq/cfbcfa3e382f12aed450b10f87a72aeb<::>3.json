Its normal body temperature is 101 -- 104 ° F ( 38 -- 40 ° C ) , so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human 's , about 65 -- 75 ° F ( 18 -- 24 ° C ) . Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) have been linked to hyperthermia and death , especially among pregnant sows . Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts , and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30 -- 70 % .",

The most common breeds found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), characterized by a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat features ruffled cowlicks or rosettes. Other popular breeds include the Peruvian and Sheltie (or Silkie), both of which have straight long hair, and the Texel, which has curly long hair. Guinea pigs' body temperature ranges between 101 - 104 °F (38 - 40 °C), and they are more tolerant of cold than heat. They prefer consistent ambient temperatures within the range of 65 - 75 °F (18 - 24 °C). Excessive heat, especially for pregnant sows, can lead to hyperthermia and death. Guinea pigs are sensitive to wind, drafts, and humidity outside the range of 30 - 70%."
