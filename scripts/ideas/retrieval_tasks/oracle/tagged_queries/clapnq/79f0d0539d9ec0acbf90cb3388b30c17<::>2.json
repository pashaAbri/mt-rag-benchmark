They serve as original sources of information about the topic. Examples of primary sources in history include novels or plays, photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings, buildings, archaeological artifacts, oral reports, and interviews. Written sources may be divided into three types: documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns, and eyewitness accounts; books, essays, and letters written by intellectuals; and religious texts and descriptions of religious ceremonies and rituals.",

Arthur Marwick says `` Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history . '' Ideally , a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied . In practice some sources have been destroyed , while others are not available for research . Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be memoirs , autobiographies , or oral interviews taken years later . Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later . Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents , or fragments of copies of documents . This is a common problem in classical studies , where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived . Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources .",
