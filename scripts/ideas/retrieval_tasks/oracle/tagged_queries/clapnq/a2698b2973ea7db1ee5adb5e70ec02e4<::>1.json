Unless they are constructed with permeable bottoms to allow water to infiltrate into the underlying soil , this subterranean basin can become a perfect mosquito breeding area because it is cool , dark , and retains stagnant water for long periods of time . Combined with standard grates which have holes large enough for mosquitoes to enter and leave the basin , this is a major problem in mosquito control .",

To reduce stormwater from rooftops , flows from eaves troughs ( rain gutters and downspouts ) may be infiltrated into adjacent soil , rather than discharged into the storm sewer system . Storm water runoff from paved surfaces can be directed to unlined ditches ( sometimes called swales or bioswales ) before flowing into the storm sewers , again to allow the runoff to soak into the ground . Permeable paving materials can be used in building sidewalks , driveways and in some cases , parking lots , to infiltrate a portion of the stormwater volume .",

However, the documents do not provide specific information on what happens to the water after it enters a storm drain. Generally, the water flows through a system of pipes and channels, eventually being discharged into a nearby water body such as a river, stream, or ocean. But, the exact path and destination of the water may vary depending on the design and location of the specific storm drain system."
