    "text": "The Romans did not consistently use a specific system for numbering the years from the founding of their city. Different historians had different dates for the founding. Roman historians used the AUC system to measure the number of years between events rather than to indicate the date of a year. The Fasti Capitolini used an epoch of 752 BC, while modern historians have adopted the epoch of Varro, 753 BC. The AUC dating system was sometimes added in Renaissance manuscripts, giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years. Censorinus stated that, in his time, the AUC year began with the Parilia, celebrated on 21 April, which was seen as the actual anniversary of the foundation of Rome. According to Roman myth, Rome was founded by Romulus, the first to dedicate spoils taken from an enemy ruler to the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius. In subsequent wars, blood-stained armor and weaponry were gathered and placed in temples as a symbol of respect towards the enemies' deities and as a way to win their patronage.",

        "text": "Julian calendar\nOnly rarely did the Romans number the year from the founding of the city ( of Rome ) , ab urbe condita ( AUC ) . This method was used by Roman historians to determine the number of years from one event to another , not to date a year . Different historians had several different dates for the founding . The Fasti Capitolini , an inscription containing an official list of the consuls which was published by Augustus , used an epoch of 752 BC . The epoch used by Varro , 753 BC , has been adopted by modern historians . Indeed , Renaissance editors often added it to the manuscripts that they published , giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years . Most modern historians tacitly assume that it began on the day the consuls took office , and ancient documents such as the Fasti Capitolini which use other AUC systems do so in the same way . However , Censorinus , writing in the 3rd century AD , states that , in his time , the AUC year began with the Parilia , celebrated on 21 April , which was regarded as the actual anniversary of the foundation of Rome .",

In Rome 's many subsequent wars , blood - stained armor and weaponry were gathered and placed in temples as a symbol of respect toward the enemies ' deities and as a way to win their patronage . As Roman power spread throughout Italy where Greek cities once reigned , Greek art was looted and ostentatiously displayed in Rome as a triumphal symbol of foreign territories brought under Roman rule . However , the triumphal procession of Marcus Claudius Marcellus after the fall of Syracuse in 211 is believed to have set a standard of reverence to conquered sanctuaries as it engendered disapproval by critics and a negative social reaction .",
