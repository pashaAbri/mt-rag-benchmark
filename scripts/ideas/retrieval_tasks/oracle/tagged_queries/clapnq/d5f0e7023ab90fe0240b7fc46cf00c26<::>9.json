    "text": "Yes, the Hudson River is considered an important river in the United States. The 315-mile-long Hudson River flows through eastern New York, serving as a boundary between New Jersey and New York. The region has experienced economic revitalization, especially in green development. Notable projects such as the High Line and the Walkway Over the Hudson, along with waterfront parks and annual festivals, contribute to the area's appeal. The Hudson River valley runs primarily from north to south down the eastern edge of New York State, cutting through a series of rock types including Triassic sandstones and redbeds in the south, and much more ancient Precambrian gneiss in the north (and east).",

The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York , and further north between New York counties . The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary occupying the Hudson Fjord , an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation , estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago .

    "original_text": "Yes, the Hudson River is considered an important river in the United States. It is a 315-mile (507 km) river that flows through New York and drains into the Atlantic Ocean. The Hudson River is historically, culturally, and economically significant to the region. It was named after Henry Hudson, an English explorer who explored the river in 1609. The river played a crucial role in the development of New York City and the surrounding areas, serving as a major transportation and trade route. Today, the Hudson River is a vital natural resource, providing habitats for numerous plant and animal species, and is used for recreational activities like boating, fishing, and swimming."
