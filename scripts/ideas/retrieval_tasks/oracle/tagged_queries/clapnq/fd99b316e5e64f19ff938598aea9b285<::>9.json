It was very successful , and forced a merger with the older NFL that resulted in a greatly expanded league and the creation of the Super Bowl , which has become the most - watched annual sporting event in the United States . The league continued to expand to its current size of 32 teams . A series of labor agreements during the 1990s and increasingly large television contracts has helped keep the league one of the most profitable in the U.S. , and the only major league in the U.S. since 1990 to avoid a work stoppage that resulted in the loss of regular - season games .",
