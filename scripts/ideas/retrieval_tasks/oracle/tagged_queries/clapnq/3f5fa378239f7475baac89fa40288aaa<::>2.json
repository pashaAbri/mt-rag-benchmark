    "text": "The average distance from the Moon to the Earth is about 238,856 miles or 384,402 kilometers. But this distance varies throughout the Moon's orbit, ranging from about 221,500 miles or 385,000 kilometers at its closest, to about 252,700 miles or 406,700 kilometers at its farthest resulting in a differential range of 50,200 kilometers or 31,200 miles. Lunar distance (astronomy) Astronomers O'Keefe and Anderson calculated the lunar distance by observing 4 occultations from 9 locations in 1952 . They calculated a mean distance of 7008384407600000000 ♠ 384 407. 6 ± 4.7 km , however the value was refined by in 1962 by Irene Fischer , who incorporated updated geodetic data to produce a value of 7008384403700000000 ♠ 384 403. 7 ± 2 km .",

The moon is then said to wane as it passes through the gibbous moon , third - quarter moon , crescent moon and back to new moon . The terms `` old moon '' and `` new moon '' are not interchangeable . The `` old moon '' is a waning sliver ( which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye ) until the moment it aligns with the sun and begins to wax , at which point it becomes new again . Half moon is often used to mean the first - and third - quarter moons , while the term ' quarter ' refers to the extent of the moon 's cycle around the Earth , not its shape .",

        "text": "Lunar phase\nThe lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the illuminated ( sunlit ) portion of the Moon as seen by an observer on Earth . The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth , according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth . The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' . ( The side of the Moon facing away from the Earth is sometimes called the `` dark side of the Moon '' , although that is a misnomer . )",
