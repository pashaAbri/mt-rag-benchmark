The lack of dams along the river provides for excellent trout habitat from high inside Yellowstone Park , downstream through Gardiner , the Paradise Valley , Livingston , and to Big Timber , a stretch of nearly 200 miles ( 320 km ) . The Yellowstone varies in width from 74 feet ( 23 m ) to 300 feet ( 91 m ) , so fishing is normally done by boat . The most productive stretch of water is through Paradise Valley in Montana , especially near Livingston which produces brown trout , rainbow trout and native Yellowstone cutthroat trout as well as Rocky Mountain whitefish . From Billings downstream to the North Dakota border , anglers seek burbot , channel catfish , paddlefish , sauger , smallmouth bass , and walleye . The pallid sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus albus ) , an endangered species endemic to the waters of the Missouri and lower Mississippi River basins , is also found in the Yellowstone .",

The Penobscot River is known for its landlocked salmon and smallmouth bass fisheries, while the Androscoggin River offers a variety of trout and other species. Ultimately, the \"best\" river for fishing would depend on the specific type of fish being sought and the individual preferences of the angler."
