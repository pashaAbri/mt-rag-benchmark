On an inflation adjusted 1973 Rupee basis , the average income of Indian agrarian labourer was Rs. 7.20 per year in 1885 , against an inflation adjusted poverty line of Rs. 23.90 per year . Thus , not only was the average income below poverty line , the intensity of poverty was severe . The intensity of poverty increased from 1885 to 1921 , then began a reversal . However , the absolute poverty rates continued to be very high through the 1930s . The colonial policies on taxation and its recognition of land ownership claims of zamindars and mansabdars , or Mughal era nobility , made a minority of families wealthy , while it weakened the ability of poorer peasants to command land and credit . The resulting rising landlessness and stagnant real wages intensified poverty .",

    "original_text": "Based on the information provided in the document about poverty in India, it can be inferred that the income of Indian agrarian laborers was low in the past. In 1885, the average income of an Indian agrarian laborer was Rs. 7.20 per year, which was significantly below the poverty line of Rs. 23.90 per year. However, the document does not provide information on the current income levels of Indian agricultural workers. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer your question without additional information. However, it is worth noting that agriculture is a significant source of employment in India, accounting for a large portion of the country's workforce."
