        "text": "Guinea pig\nC. porcellus is not found naturally in the wild ; it is likely descended from closely related species of cavies , such as C. aperea , C. fulgida , and C. tschudii , which are still commonly found in various regions of South America . Studies from 2007 -- 2010 applied molecular markers and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals , thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be Cavia tschudii . Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them .",

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion .Domestic guinea pigs, on the other hand, have a slightly different diet and may require a balanced diet of specially formulated guinea pig pellets, fresh vegetables, and hay.\n|user|: I meant c. tschudii specifically, but thank you for the information regarding the domesticated guinea pig.\n|assistant|: Cavia tschudii, which is believed to be the ancestor of the domesticated guinea pig, primarily eats grass in the wild. Like other species of cavies, they may also supplement their diet with feces (cecophagy), consuming special soft pellets called cecotropes for additional nutrients.\n|user|: Thanks for clarifying. Do they have predators?\n|assistant|: Yes, wild cavies, including Cavia tschudii, have predators. However, the documents do not provide specific information on what animals prey on them. As they are social animals that live in groups and are most active during dawn and dusk, they likely have predators that are active during those times and hunt by sight. These could include birds of prey, felids, and canids, among others.\n|user|: I'm told guinea pigs are raised for human consumption. Is that true?\n|assistant|: Yes, that is true. They were originally domesticated for their meat by tribes in the Andes, where they are a culinary staple, as early as 5000 BC  and are raised for human consumption ini Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia particularly in the Andes Mountain Highlands. They are a traditional source of protein in these regions and are often featured in local cuisine. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large - scale municipal fairs ,\n|user|: human guinea pig"

        "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig 's natural diet is grass ; their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter and grow continuously throughout their life . Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .",

        "text": "Guinea pig\nIn English , the term `` guinea pig '' is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation , or any experiment or test in modern times . This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludvík Vaculík as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .",

I'm looking for information about a person who is called a \"human guinea pig.\"\nAssistant: Apologies for the confusion. A \"human guinea pig\" generally refers to a person who voluntarily participates in experiments, trials, or tests of new products, drugs, or procedures, allowing researchers to study their effects or efficacy. These individuals consent to take part in such activities, understanding the associated risks and benefits, and contribute valuable data to advance scientific knowledge and development."
