    "text": "During the reign of Constantine in the Byzantine Empire, Christianity was not declared the exclusive state religion, but it received special favor from the emperor, who granted it generous privileges. Constantine also established the principle that emperors could not unilaterally decide matters of religious doctrine, and instead, they should convene general ecclesiastical councils for that purpose. His summoning of the Synod of Arles and the First Council of Nicaea demonstrated his commitment to the unity of the Church and asserted his authority as its leader.The ascendancy of Christianity was briefly challenged when Emperor Julian came to power in 361 and sought to revive polytheism throughout the empire. He was later known as \"Julian the Apostate\" by the Church. However, Julian's efforts were reversed when he died in battle in 363.\nThe foundation of the Byzantine Empire was based on the belief that it was a reflection of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Just as God ruled in Heaven, the Emperor, created in His image, was expected to govern on Earth and uphold His commandments. The empire aspired to be universal and aimed to encompass all the peoples of the Earth. Ideally, all people would be members of the one true Christian Church, the Orthodox Church.",

        "text": "Byzantine Empire\nSeveral signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West divided . Constantine I ( r . 324 -- 337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital , and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r . 379 -- 395 ) , Christianity became the Empire 's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . Finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r . 610 -- 641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin . Thus , although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture , and characterised by Orthodox Christianity .",

Just as God ruled in Heaven , so the Emperor , made in his image , should rule on earth and carry out his commandments ... It saw itself as a universal empire . Ideally , it should embrace all the peoples of the Earth who , ideally , should all be members of the one true Christian Church , its own Orthodox Church . Just as man was made in God 's image , so man 's kingdom on Earth was made in the image of the Kingdom of Heaven . '' The survival of the Empire in the East assured an active role of the Emperor in the affairs of the Church . The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative , and financial routine of administering religious affairs , and this routine was applied to the Christian Church . Following the pattern set by Eusebius of Caesarea , the Byzantines viewed the Emperor as a representative or messenger of Christ , responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans , and for the `` externals '' of the religion , such as administration and finances . As Cyril Mango points out , the Byzantine political thinking can be summarised in the motto `` One God , one empire , one religion '' .",
