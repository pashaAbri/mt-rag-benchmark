In return, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island.",

        "text": "Franklin D. Roosevelt\nRoosevelt , Churchill , and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference . With the end of the war in Europe approaching , Roosevelt 's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan ; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties . In return for the Soviet Union 's entrance into the war against Japan , the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island . The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations , and they also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council , which would be charged with ensuring international peace and security . Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland , but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe , which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany . Germany itself would not be dismembered , but would be jointly occupied by the United States , France , Britain , and the Soviet Union . Against Soviet pressure , Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war . Roosevelt 's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial ; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe , while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war .
