In this storyline , he steals the Gems and inserts them into a golden glove known as the Infinity Gauntlet and reveals the Gems to be the last remains of an omnipotent being . In the miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet , Thanos uses the Gems to become nearly omnipotent and kills half the universe 's population as a gift to his love , the cosmic embodiment of Death . Although he easily repels an attack by Earth 's heroes and other cosmic entities , the Gauntlet is eventually stolen from him by Nebula , who undoes his mass killings . Adam Warlock then recovers the Gauntlet and divides the Gems among a group he calls `` the Infinity Watch , '' consisting of himself , the superheroes Gamora , Pip the Troll , Drax the Destroyer , Moondragon , and his former adversary Thanos . This group 's adventures in defending the Gems appeared in the series Warlock and the Infinity Watch ( 1992 - 1995 ) .",
