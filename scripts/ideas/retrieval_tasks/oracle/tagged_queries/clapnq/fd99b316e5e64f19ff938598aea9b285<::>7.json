In the United Kingdom in the 1980s , the sport was fairly popular , with the 1986 Super Bowl being watched by over 4 million people ( about 1 out of every 14 Britons ) . The sport 's popularity faded over the 1990s , coinciding with the establishment of the Premier League . According to BBC America , there is a `` social stigma '' surrounding American football in the UK , with many Brits feeling the sport has no right to call itself ' football ' due to the small emphasis on kicking . Nonetheless , the sport has retained a following in the United Kingdom ; the NFL operates a media network in the country , and since 2007 has hosted the NFL International Series in London . Super Bowl viewership has also rebounded , with over 4.4 million Britons watching Super Bowl XLVI .",
