MacArthur saw the Emperor as a symbol of unity and a figurehead who could help in implementing the necessary changes in Japan's political and social structure. Moreover, Hirohito's role in the war was seen as more ceremonial and less directly involved in the military atrocities committed by Japan. Therefore, MacArthur decided not to pursue criminal charges against the Emperor, and instead focused on the prosecution of other high-ranking Japanese officials responsible for war crimes."
