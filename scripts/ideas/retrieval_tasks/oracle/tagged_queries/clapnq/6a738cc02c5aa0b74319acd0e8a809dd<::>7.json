        "text": "Infertility\nThe main cause of male infertility is low semen quality . In men who have the necessary reproductive organs to procreate , infertility can be caused by low sperm count due to endocrine problems , drugs , radiation , or infection . There may be testicular malformations , hormone imbalance , or blockage of the man 's duct system . Although many of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions , some may be indefinite . Infertility associated with viable , but immotile sperm may be caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia . The sperm must provide the zygote with DNA , centrioles , and activation factor for the embryo to develop . A defect in any of these sperm structures may result in infertility that will not be detected by semen analysis . Antisperm antibodies cause immune infertility .",

Low semen quality 2. Endocrine problems 3. Drugs 4. Radiation 5. Infection 6. Testicular malformations 7. Hormone imbalance 8. Blockage of the duct system 9. Primary ciliary dyskinesia 10. Antisperm antibodies Female infertility can be caused by: 1. Inability to ovulate 2. Malformation of the eggs 3. Polycystic ovarian syndrome 4. Failure of ovaries to mature and release eggs 5. Ovulatory problems These causes can be diagnosed and, in some cases, treated through medical intervention. However, in about 10-20% of cases, no cause is found.\n|user|: How many years, think about adoption?\n|assistant|: The documents do not include information on how long to consider adoption after experiencing infertility. This decision is often very personal and can depend on many factors.\n|user|: Regional differences\n|assistant|: The documents do not include information about regional differences in infertility types and causes.  Existing definitions of infertility lack uniformity , rendering comparisons in prevalence between countries or over time problematic . \n|user|: chemo and fertility,  before puberty, still?\n|assistant|: The documents do not provide specific information about the impact of chemotherapy on fertility before puberty.   But, yes, chemotherapy can affect fertility.  It can cause DNA damaging of the cells in the testicles or ovaries that produce sperm and eggs, potentially leading to reduced fertility or even sterility.\n|user|: any good idea to this?\n|assistant|: While chemotherapy can impact fertility, there are options available to preserve fertility before starting treatment, such as sperm or egg freezing; eggs may be frozen and stored for later use.  For semen, cryopreservation can be used for far longer storage durations like 21 yrs.  However, these options may not be suitable for everyone, especially those who have not yet reached puberty.  It's important to discuss the potential risks and available options with a healthcare provider before starting chemotherapy.\n|user|: Enough for a chemo and infertility, is this a hereditary?\n|assistant|: The cause of infertility is suspected to be immunological or genetic ; it may be that each partner is independently fertile but the couple can not conceive together. \n|user|: By the way, when was the vitro conception developed?"

In July 1983 , a clinic in Southern California reported a pregnancy using egg donation , which led to the birth of the first American child born from egg donation on February 3 , 1984 . This procedure was performed at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine . In the procedure , which is no longer used today , a fertilized egg that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later . The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby .",
