        "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMajor League Soccer 's first all - star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996 . The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .",

                    "model_text": "|user|: how does the mls all star game work?\n|assistant|: The MLS All-Star Game is an annual soccer game where selected players from Major League Soccer (MLS) compete against an international club. The format of the game has evolved over the years. Initially, it featured the Eastern Conference playing against the Western Conference. However, since 2005, MLS has been inviting a professional club from abroad to participate. The opponents are usually from Europe, specifically England's Premier League, due to the scheduling coincidence of the MLS midseason with the pre-seasons of most European leagues. Players earn roster spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner. The game is considered a pre-season friendly from a European perspective.              \n|user|: When did the MSL All-Star game start?\n|assistant|: The first MLS All-Star Game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996. The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . In 2012, the game was played in PPL Park, Chester,Pennsylvania ; in 2013 the Sporting Park , Kansas City hosted the game and in 2015, the Major League Soccer All-Star Game was played in the Dicks's Sporting Goods Park, in Commerce City Colorado.                         The first MLS All-Star Game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996.\n|user|: MSL All-Star game seems to be a big sport event.  Have any teams from Europe played in the MSL All-Star Games ?\n|assistant|: Yes. Several teams from Europe have participated in the MLS All-Star Games. The 2002 game featured the U.S. national team as the opponent, but since then, every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league. Teams from England's Premier League have made up the majority of these opponents like the Manchester United . For instance, the 2009 game saw Everton as the opponent, while Tottenham Hotspur participated in the 2015 game. The 2007 game featured Celtic from Scotland; Roma was invited to be opponent in 2013; Bayern Munich in 2014; Real Madrid participated in the 2017 All-Star Game . Those are some Europeans teams that had played int the MLS ALL-Star Games .\n|user|: Talking about soccer, Can you name the best soccer players of all the time?\n|assistant|: Yes. I can provide some names of the most renowned soccer players of all time. For instance Zinedine Zidane that  has been named FIFA World Player of the Year three times. In 2002 , ESPN described Zidane as the greatest player in the world in the world 's biggest game . In 2004 , he was voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years , and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world 's greatest living players . Cristiano Ronaldo is also considered one the best player of the world. Sports journalists believe  that he is the best player in modern football, widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time . He has scored more than 600 senior career goals for club and country . Lionel Messi is also one of the best soccer player to ever play the game .Pelé is considered the  best soccer player of the last century.\n|user|: What  does it make a good soccer player?\n|assistant|: A good soccer player typically needs to possess a combination of various skills like passing , tackling , evasion of tackles , catching and kicking   and talent. It is important that they are lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance. A good height is also considered advantageous somewhat as can determine the position that they play as for forwards who aim to score with their heads  ; however , people of all heights have an equal opportunity to excel professionally at the sport .A study of the greatest male players in history showed that the distribution of heights approximated the average man.\n|user|: Are Soccer still considered the most watched sports around the world?\n|assistant|: Yes, soccer, also known as football in many parts of the world, is still considered the most popular and most-watched sport globally played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations , and has the highest television audience in sport , making it  definitely the most popular in the world.  The World Cup is also the  most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world . The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion . 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament ( a ninth of the entire population of the planet ) . To you knowledge   England is recognized by FIFA as the birthplace of club football , and The Football Association is the oldest of its kind , with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley \n|user|: What can you say about American Football? Is i talso considered a popular sport as soccer?\n|assistant|: American Football ,known also as gridiron in some other regions,  is indeed, by several measures, is the most popular spectator sport in the United States. It has a large following and attracts significant television audiences.  It is also played and viewed in another countries. For instance, American football has a long history in Mexico , which was introduced to the sport in 1896 . It  was the second-most popular sport in Mexico in the 1950s , with the game being particularly popular in colleges . The Los Angeles Times notes that the NFL claims over 16 million fans in Mexico , which places the country third behind the US and Canada. The sport is played in European countries as well such as Switzerland , which has American football clubs in every major city , and Germany . But in those countries American football has not yet reached the same level of popularity it has in North America. It is important to note that the National Football League ( NFL ) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world , and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally . Additionally  College football  attract large audiences . However it is not played worldwide like soccer.\n|user|: Is Basketball also considered a very popular sport in America?"
