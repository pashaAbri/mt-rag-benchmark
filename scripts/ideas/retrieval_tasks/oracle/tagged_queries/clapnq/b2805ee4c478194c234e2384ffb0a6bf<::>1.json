It came into use in the Mughal Empire around the 16th century and is still used in the Indian subcontinent today. However, it's important to note that there were different types of cotton gins, including a handheld roller gin used in India since at least 500 CE, and a single-roller cotton gin found in the Ajanta caves of India and used until innovations were made in the form of foot-powered gins. The modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor Eli Whitney in 1793 and patented in 1794, but I have no information as to its current usage. The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous , because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin 's parts for other tools .",

        "text": "Cotton gin\nHandheld roller gins had been used in India and then other countries since at earliest 500 CE . The Indian worm - gear roller gin , invented some time around the sixteenth century , has , according to Lakwete , remained virtually unchanged up to the present time . A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor Eli Whitney in 1793 and patented in 1794 . Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased . The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War . Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws , and offer far higher productivity than their hand - powered forebears .",

Evidence for this type of gin has been found in Africa , Asia , and North America . The first documentation of the cotton gin by contemporary scholars is found in the fifth century AD , in the form of Buddhist paintings depicting a single - roller gin in the Ajanta Caves in western India . These early gins were difficult to use and required a great deal of skill . A narrow single roller was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds . The design was similar to that of a mealing stone , which was used to grind grain . The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous , because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin 's parts for other tools .",
