The chorus has Mars singing , `` I 'd catch a grenade for ya , '' and speaks of unrequited love when the subject girl of his affections `` wo n't do the same '' . Tim Byron , writer for The Vine , `` ' Grenade ' is about the feeling of withdrawal '' . The critic added , `` Mars knows she is bad for him , that 's she 's preventing him from thinking straight , that he ca n't actually have her the way he wants , but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her . '' As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul : `` ' Grenade ' represents the OTHER side of love -- where you 're in love with a woman and you know for a fact that she does n't love you the way you love HER .
