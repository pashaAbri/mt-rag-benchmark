        "text": "The Office (U.S. season 9)\nThe season aired on Thursdays at 9 : 00 p.m. , as part of the Comedy Night Done Right programming block . The season premiere , `` New Guys '' received a 2.1 / 6 percent share in the Nielsen ratings among viewers aged 18 to 49 , meaning that 2.1 percent of viewers aged 18 to 49 watched the episode , and 6 percent of viewers watching television at the time watched the episode . The episode was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and became the lowest - rated season premiere for the series . In addition , it marked a 46 percent drop in viewership from the season eight premiere `` The List '' . For the first sixteen episodes , the series was able to maintain roughly 4 million viewers . However , starting with the seventeenth episode `` The Farm '' , ratings began to drop below this threshold . The series hit an all - time low with the twentieth episode , `` Paper Airplane '' , which was viewed by only 3.25 million viewers , and received a 1.7 rating / 5 percent share . The series finale was viewed by 5.69 million viewers and received a 3.0 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This made it the highest - rated episode of the season ; it also marked an increase in the previous season finale , which garnered only 4.49 million viewers . `` Finale '' was the most watched episode of The Office since the eighth season episode `` Pool Party '' , but ranked as the third - least watched finale of the series , following the eighth - and first - season finales . Although in its ninth season , The Office no longer was NBC 's highest - rated scripted comedy series -- it was surpassed by Go On -- it often ranked as the highest - rated scripted NBC series on Thursday nights . Rainn Wilson argued that the show 's lower ratings were a combination of the overall trend in lower television ratings in 2012 , as well as the fact that `` NBC did n't promote ( the series ) one bit '' . NBC increased their usual ad - price by 200 percent for the finale , asking for $400,000 per commercial . This was largely due to the anticipated increase in viewership that the finale would bring .",

    "original_text": "The 46% drop in viewership from the season eight premiere to the season nine premiere could be due to various factors. One possibility is that the overall trend of lower television ratings in 2012 affected the show's performance. Another factor could be related to promotion; according to Rainn Wilson, NBC did not promote the series as much as before.\nAs for the audience, the document states that the show received a 2.6 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, meaning that, on average, the season was viewed by 2.6 percent of all 18-to-49-year-olds. It was viewed by 3.32 million in this demographic. However, the document does not provide more specific information about the audience's preferences or reasons for the drop in viewership."
