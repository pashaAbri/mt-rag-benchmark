He also wields mystical artifacts including the Cloak of Levitation, the Eye of Agamotto, the Book of the Vishanti, and the Orb of Agamotto which give him additional powers.\n|user|: did he always have powers? what was he before?\n|assistant|: No, Doctor Strange did not always have powers. He was a brilliant but egotistical neurosurgeon. He was in a car accident that ended his surgical career. He searched the globe for a way to repair his hands and encountered the Ancient One, eventually becoming one of her students.\n|user|: how many films does he appear in\n|assistant|: I do not have an exact count of films but Doctor Strange appears in at least four films:  Doctor Strange , Thor : Ragnarok and Avengers : Infinity War, and The Amazing Spider - Man.\n|user|: wasn't he in captain america?\n|assistant|: Doctor Strange was first referenced by name in the film Captain America: The Winter Soldier but he did not appear in the film.\n|user|: I see thanks for explaining. Why was he referenced in the film?\n|assistant|: I'm sorry, but I cannot find the reason he was referenced in the film.\n|user|: does he have an infinity gem\n|assistant|: Yes, Doctor Strange possesses the Time Stone. The Time Stone is encased in the Eye of Agamotto, a mystical relic that Doctor Strange uses to manipulate time.\n|user|: how many stones are there"
