    "text": "Yes, both sports originated from the older game of rugby football in the 19th century. British colonists and the British military introduced football to North America, where it became popular in American and Canadian universities and prep schools. At that time, association football and rugby football were not as distinct as they are now, and teams would negotiate the rules before each game. It's possible to compare American football and rugby league because they share origins and similar game concepts. Along with Canadian football, the rugby league is the sport most similar to American football. Both sports involve a limited number of downs or tackles, and scoring touchdowns or tries takes precedence over goal-kicking.",

    "original_text": "Yes, American football shares some similarities with rugby as it evolved from both association football (soccer) and rugby football. Both sports involve a ball being moved down a field with the objective of scoring points, and they both allow for physical contact between players. However, there are significant differences in the rules, strategies, and equipment used in both sports. For instance, in American football, players wear helmets, shoulder pads, and other protective gear, while rugby players do not. Additionally, American football features more stoppages in play and allows for forward passing, whereas rugby does not."
