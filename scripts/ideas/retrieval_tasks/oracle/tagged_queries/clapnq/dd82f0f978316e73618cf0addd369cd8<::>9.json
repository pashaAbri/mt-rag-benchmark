        "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMajor League Soccer 's first all - star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996 . The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .",

The format of the game has evolved over the years. Initially, it featured the Eastern Conference playing against the Western Conference. However, since 2005, MLS has been inviting a professional club from abroad to participate.

The sport is played in European countries as well such as Switzerland , which has American football clubs in every major city , and Germany .

The match lays claim to this distinction because of factors which establish its link to modern ice hockey : it featured two teams ( nine players per side ) with a recorded score . Games prior to this had mostly been outdoors . In order to limit injuries to spectators and damage to glass windows , the game was played with a `` flat block of wood '' instead of a lacrosse ball . The two teams , members of the club , included a number of McGill University students . Sticks for this game were imported from Nova Scotia .

It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise , and the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) considers it to be one of the `` most important championships available to the sport '' . Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named after Lord Stanley of Preston , then -- Governor General of Canada , who donated it as an award to Canada 's top - ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . After a series of league mergers and folds , it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 .",
