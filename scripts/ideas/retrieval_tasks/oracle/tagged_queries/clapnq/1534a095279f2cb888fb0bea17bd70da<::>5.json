This type of photography is common at airshows or airports.\n|user|: No, I meant photos in the air.\n|assistant|: Air - to - air aviation photography is the art of photographing aircraft in the air, while using another aircraft as a photo platform.\n|user|: So does that mean pilot of the second aircraft also acts as a photographer?\n|assistant|: I am sorry I don't have any specific knowledge about who acts as a photographer in air-to-air aviation photography. \n|user|: Is air-to-air phtography more difficult that ground-to-air?\n|assistant|: Air-to-air military aviation photography,  requires additional skills , as the photo and target aircraft often fly at velocities of over Mach 1, while under moderate to high G . On the other hand, a long focus photographic lens is necessary due to the greater distance between the photographer and the target aircraft in ground-to-air settings. Thus is it hard to say if one is more difficult than other conclusively.\n|user|: are there any other types of aviation photography?"

Photos can be of aircraft exteriors , interiors , and aircraft details . The photographer has full control over lighting , aircraft placement , camera angles , and background . Involving other subjects such as the pilot or other aircraft is much easier to accomplish in ground - static photography than in other forms of aerial photography .",
