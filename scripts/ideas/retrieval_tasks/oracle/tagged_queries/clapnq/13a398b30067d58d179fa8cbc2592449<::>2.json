    "text": " I cannot definitively say whether the summer months in North Carolina are enjoyable or not, as relative humidity is highest in the winter suggesting  that the summer months might be less humid.  There is an average of forty - five inches of rain a year ( fifty in the mountains ) . July storms account for much of this precipitation .In fact, North Carolina experience severe weather in  both summer and winter. The summer can bring the threat of hurricanes , tropical storms , heavy rain , and flooding . Indeed, destructive hurricanes that have hit North Carolina include Hurricane Fran , Hurricane Floyd , and Hurricane Hazel , the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state , as a Category 4 in 1954 . Hurricane Isabel ranks as the most destructive of the 21st century .",

        "text": "Climate of North Carolina\nAnother significant snowfall hit the Raleigh area in January 2000 when more than 20 inches ( 510 mm ) of snow fell . There was also a heavy snowfall totaling 18 inches ( 460 mm ) that hit the Wilmington area on December 22 - 23 , 1989 . This storm affected only the Southeastern US coast , as far south as Savannah , GA , with little to no snow measured west of I - 95 . Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina . These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level , usually propelled southward from Arctic high pressure over the Northeastern or New England states . If the storms track sufficiently far to the east , snow will be limited to the eastern part of the state ( as with the December 22 - 23 , 1989 storm ) . If the cyclones travel close to the coast , warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean , bringing a rain / snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont , foothills and mountains , as with the January 22 , 1987 storm . If the storm tracks inland into eastern North Carolina , the rain / snow line ranges between Raleigh and Greensboro .",

Cold fronts from Canada are typically reduced in intensity by the mountains . However , occasionally cold air can move from the north or northeast , east of the Appalachian Mountains , from Arctic high pressure systems that settle over the Northeastern or New England states . Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross the mountains and force temperatures to drop to about 12 ° F ( − 11 ° C ) in central North Carolina . Still , temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of the mountains . The coldest ever recorded temperature in North Carolina was − 34 ° F ( − 37 ° C ) on January 21 , 1985 , at Mount Mitchell . The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream . The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still higher than the average ocean temperature in Maine during July . Snow is common in the mountains , although many ski resorts use snowmaking equipment to make sure there is always snow on their land . North Carolina 's relative humidity is highest in the winter .",

The documents also do not indicate that North Carolina experiences extreme heatwaves or other weather events that would make summers unenjoyable.
