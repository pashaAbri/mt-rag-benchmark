There are many deep pools within the river , due to the many slate ledges , making the river ideal for fishing from shore , though there are still areas that are good for canoe fishing . The river is great for a day fishing trip , however there are a few campsites located sporadically around for people who wish to stay more than one day . With the Ripogenus Dam by Chesuncook Lake , the West Branch is able to sustain the large landlocked salmon found there , with twelve miles of heavy rapids , deep runs , large pools , and slower moving water in some sections . Baxter State Park to the north adds to the natural beauty of the area , and natural protection as well .",

    "original_text": "The West Branch of the Penobscot River is one of the two branches that form the main Penobscot River. It is part of the Penobscot River system that originates from several lakes in north-central Maine. The West Branch specifically flows into the East Branch at Medway to form the Penobscot River. When considering both the West Branch and the South Branch, the Penobscot River system becomes 264 miles long, making it the longest entirely in the state of Maine."
