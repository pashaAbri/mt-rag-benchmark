        "text": "Infertility\nThe main cause of male infertility is low semen quality . In men who have the necessary reproductive organs to procreate , infertility can be caused by low sperm count due to endocrine problems , drugs , radiation , or infection . There may be testicular malformations , hormone imbalance , or blockage of the man 's duct system . Although many of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions , some may be indefinite . Infertility associated with viable , but immotile sperm may be caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia . The sperm must provide the zygote with DNA , centrioles , and activation factor for the embryo to develop . A defect in any of these sperm structures may result in infertility that will not be detected by semen analysis . Antisperm antibodies cause immune infertility .",

        "text": "Infertility\nAnother major cause of infertility in women may be the inability to ovulate . Malformation of the eggs themselves may complicate conception . For example , polycystic ovarian syndrome is when the eggs only partially developed within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones . Some women are infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs . In this case synthetic FSH by injection or Clomid ( Clomiphene citrate ) via a pill can be given to stimulate follicles to mature in the ovaries .",

There are many causes of infertility , including some that medical intervention can treat . Estimates from 1997 suggest that worldwide about five percent of all heterosexual couples have an unresolved problem with infertility . Many more couples , however , experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year : estimates range from 12 % to 28 % . '' 20 - 30 % of infertility cases are due to male infertility , 20 - 35 % are due to female infertility , and 25 - 40 % are due to combined problems in both parts . In 10 - 20 % of cases , no cause is found . The most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory problems which generally manifest themselves by sparse or absent menstrual periods . Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen , and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity .",
