Click on 'Create new estimate' and enter a name and description for the estimate. 3. Click on 'Create' and you will be directed to the estimate details page. 4. Click on 'Go to catalog' to add products to the estimate. 5. Select the product you are interested in and choose your pricing plan and enter any necessary configuration details. 6. Click on 'Add to estimate'. 7. Enter your estimated usage and click on 'Calculate Cost'. You can adjust the estimated usage and recalculate the cost to see how different usage levels affect the overall cost. By default, the estimator shows the pricing and billing currency set for your account. If you're estimating costs for a different location or currency, you might have to select the appropriate currency on the order summary page for the product or change the currency on your account. Once you have added all the products to your estimate, review the product details and click on 'View estimate' to see the total estimated cost.",
