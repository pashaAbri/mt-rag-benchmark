The appearance of the launcher icon adapts to desktop and mobile browsers.\n\n![web chat launcher in desktop browser](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/web-chat-desktop-highlighted.png)\n\nWhen a customer clicks the launcher, the web chat window opens, initially displaying the home screen. The home screen displays a greeting and an optional set of suggested conversation starters for common questions and problems. The customer can either click a conversation starter or type a message in the input field to start the conversation with the assistant.\n\n![web chat example home screen](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/web-chat-home-screen-lendyr.png)\n\nThe appearance and behavior of the launcher icon, the home screen, and most other aspects of the web chat can be configured and customized to match your website style and branding. For more information, see [Configuring the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-config).\n\n\n\n Launcher appearance and behavior \n\nThe web chat launcher welcomes and engages customers so they know where to find help if they need it. By default, the web chat launcher appears in a small initial state as a circle in the bottom right corner:\n\n!",

The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard. It is tested with both screen readers and automated tools on a continual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n Language support",

Only serve content over HTTPS, use Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.",
