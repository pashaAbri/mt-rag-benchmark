So you can easily add an image or PDF as an attachment to your document but you must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you’re looking at larger assets.\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant’s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data. So, slow and expensive. IBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it’s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document.",

As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it’s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document. Yes, that means you need to write some extra code to upload the attachment to a suitable block store of your choice.

For more information, see the following websites:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant docs on [attachments](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-how-to-use-attachments)\n* Detaching IBM Cloudant attachments to [Object Storage](https://medium.com/codait/detaching-cloudant-attachments-to-object-storage-with-serverless-functions-99b8c3c77925)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fewer databases are better than many \n\nIf you can, limit the number of databases per IBM Cloudant account to 500 or fewer. While this particular number is not magic (IBM Cloudant can safely handle more), several use cases exist that are adversely affected by large numbers of databases in an account.\n\nThe replicator scheduler has a limited number of simultaneous replication jobs that it is prepared to run. As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.",
