Even though you provide your credit card information for account security and identity verification purposes, you can still use IBM Cloud for free by selecting products in the catalog that offer Free and Lite pricing plans. Another account type, called a Subscription account, is also available. With a Subscription account, you get many of the same features of a Pay-As-You-Go account, plus discounts for platform services and support with a more consistent billing structure that uses subscriptions.\n\n\n\n Comparing accounts \n\nThe following table provides a comparison of Trial, Pay-As-You-Go, and Subscription accounts. For more details about each account, see the sections that follow.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Comparison of IBM Cloud accounts\nThis table has row and column headers. The row headers identify the feature.
