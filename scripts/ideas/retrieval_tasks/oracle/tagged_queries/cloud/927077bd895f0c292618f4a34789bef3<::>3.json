It introduced new commands image-obsolete and image-deprecate for image lifecycle management. It also added support for image lifecycle management in image-create, image-update, and images commands and it fixed an issue with using the SSH key generated from UI in CLI.\n|user|: Tell me more about the new commands\n|assistant|: The new commands introduced in version 6.15.0 of the IBM Cloud® Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) command line interface (CLI) are image-obsolete and image-deprecate. These commands support image lifecycle management, allowing users to manage the lifecycle of their custom images more effectively. The image-obsolete command can be used to mark an image as obsolete, indicating that it is no longer available to be used to provision an instance. The image-deprecate command can be used to mark an image as deprecated, discouraging its use before it becomes obsolete.\n|user|: How do I use them?"
