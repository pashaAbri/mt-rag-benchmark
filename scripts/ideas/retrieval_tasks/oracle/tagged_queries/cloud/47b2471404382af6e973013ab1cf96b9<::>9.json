Each account in an enterprise can contain resources in resource groups. Account groups can't contain resources. For more information, see [Managing resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manage_resource).\n\nZoom\n\n![A diagram that shows that resources are contained in accounts in the enterprise.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/d4595e5202a9a27767cf034e81b038cdf772e0d5/secure-enterprise/images/enterprise-resources.svg)\n\nFigure 3. Resources in an enterprise\n\nAs with all accounts, resources are tied to the resource group and account in which they're created, so they can't be moved between accounts in the enterprise. However, the enterprise's flexible account structure means you can move resources within the enterprise by moving the accounts that contain them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Top-down usage reporting \n\nFrom the enterprise account, you can view resource usage from all accounts in the enterprise. Starting at the enterprise level, you see estimated usage costs that are broken down by account and account groups. You can navigate down within the enterprise structure to see the costs within each level.",

At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team.\n\n\n\n* You give your financial officer access to view the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department.\n* You give each department lead access to view usage for everything in their department's account group.\n* You give each team lead access to view only the accounts in their team's account group.\n\n\n\nBecause access in the enterprise is separate from access in each account, enterprise users can't automatically manage resources within the child accounts. Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API. For more information, see [Viewing usage in an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Invoicing and payments \n\nUsage in the enterprise is invoiced through the enterprise account. As with all billable accounts, usage is invoiced monthly, and the invoice is due on the billing date for your account. During each billing cycle, a single invoice with the usage costs from all accounts is made available in the enterprise account. The invoice contains costs for all platform and infrastructure usage as a single-line item in your invoice.",

The accounts and account groups that you can view usage for depend on your assigned access.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises enable you to centrally manage multiple IBM Cloud accounts. As an enterprise user, you can keep an eye on resource usage and the associated costs for any account in the enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) for more information.\n\n\n\n Required access for viewing enterprise usage \n\nIn an enterprise, access to usage information is controlled by the Enterprise service. To view usage information, users must be invited to the enterprise account and have the Usage Reports Viewer, Editor, or Administrator role on the Enterprise service. The Usage Reports Viewer role provides access only to viewing usage reports, while the Editor and Administrator roles enable additional enterprise management actions. In keeping with security best practices, assign the least amount of access that is needed for the user to complete their task. For more information, see [Enterprise actions and roles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management).\n\nYou can give users granular access so that they can view usage for a certain account or account group. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team. You can scope the access so that each enterprise user can see only the information that is needed to fulfill their job role.\n\n\n\n* Your financial officer needs to view usage for the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department, but they don't need to create accounts or account groups. Assign them the Usage Reports Viewer role for the enterprise.\n* Each department lead needs to view usage for their department, and they also need to create and manage accounts and account groups for their teams. Assign each department lead the Editor role for their department's account group.\n* Each team lead needs to view their team's usage, but you want them to get department approval to add new accounts to their team.",
