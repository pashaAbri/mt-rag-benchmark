The VPC load balancer that is automatically created in your VPC outside of your cluster when you use one of these services routes traffic to your app. You can improve the security of your cluster and control public network traffic to your apps by replacing the kube-<vpc-id> security group, which is automatically applied to the VPC ALB, with a security group that you create and manage. When applied to ALBs, security groups control which inbound traffic is permitted to your cluster through the ALB.\n\nReady to get started with a cluster for this scenario? After you plan your [high availability](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters) and [worker node](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes) setups, see [Creating VPC clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scenario: Run internet-facing app workloads in a VPC cluster with limited public egress \n\nIn this scenario, you run workloads in a VPC cluster that are accessible to requests from the Internet. Public access is controlled so that end users can access your apps while unwanted public requests to your apps are denied. However, you might need to also provide limited public egress from your worker nodes to a public endpoint, and want to ensure that this public egress is controlled and isolated in your cluster. For example, you might need your app pods to access an IBM Cloud service that does not support private cloud service endpoints, and must be accessed over the public network.\n\nZoom\n\n![Network setup for a cluster that allows limited, secure public access.]",
