    "text": "No, before you switch the traffic for your domain to CIS, it's important to import or recreate your DNS records in CIS. Although you can skip this step, it's crucial to ensure that your DNS records are correctly configured in CIS to avoid any parts of your website becoming inaccessible. Here are the command options: DNS_DOMAIN_ID: The ID of the DNS domain. Since CIS doesn't support email traffic by default, you need to set the PTR record to the location of your email server. You may need to reach out to your email provider for help. Import records - By default, a total of 3500 DNS records are allowed (imported and created on CIS). ",

Contact your email provider for assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Updating DNS records \n\nIn each record row, you can click the Edit record option from the menu, which opens a dialog box that you can use to update the record.\n\nAfter you are finished making your changes, select Update record to save them, or Cancel to abort the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n Deleting DNS records \n\nIn each record row, you can select the Delete record option from the menu, which opens a dialog box to confirm the delete process.\n\nYou can select the Delete button to confirm your delete action. Select Cancel if you don't want to delete.\n\n\n\n\n\n Importing and exporting DNS records \n\nDNS records can be imported into and exported from CIS. All files are imported and exported as .txt files in BIND format. Learn more about [BIND format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file). Click the overflow menu and select to import or export records.\n\nImport records - By default, a total of 3500 DNS records are allowed (imported and created on CIS). You can import multiple files, one at a time, as long as the total number of records is under the max limit. After importing, you are shown a summary with the number of records successfully added and the number that failed, along with the reason why each record failed.\n\nExport records - Use Export records to create a backup of your zone file, or export it to use with another DNS provider. When this menu option is clicked, the records are downloaded to the location specified by your browser settings (typically the Downloads folder). To select another folder location, change your browser's settings to prompt you for a location with each download.\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring and managing your secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally sign DNS data so you can be assured it is valid. To eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).",

Add and configure your domain \n\nNext, begin protecting and improving the performance of your web service by entering your domain or a subdomain.\n\nSpecify DNS zones. You can configure the name servers for these domains or subdomains at the domain's registrar or DNS provider. Do not use CNAMEs.\n\nThe Overview screen shows your domain in Pending status and remains Pending until you complete configuring your name servers with the registrar or existing DNS provider, which is covered in Step 4.\n\nYou cannot delete the CIS instance after you add a domain. To delete the instance, delete the domain from the instance first.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 3. Set up your DNS records (optional) \n\nBefore transitioning the traffic for your domain to CIS, it is recommended that you import or recreate your DNS records in CIS. You can choose to skip this step, but if your DNS records are not configured properly in CIS, it might leave parts of your website inaccessible.\n\nImport records by uploading your exported records from your current DNS, or manually create your DNS records. To import records, select Import records.\n\nWhen you are finished, or to skip this step, select Next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4. Configure your name servers with the registrar or existing DNS provider \n\nTo begin receiving the benefits of CIS, you must delegate your domain to CIS. To delegate a domain, create an NS record with the name servers provided by CIS at your domain's registrar or existing DNS provider. If you are unsure of who the registrar is for your domain, you can look it up at [whois.icann.org](https://whois.icann.org/).\n\nIf you delegate a subdomain (for instance, subdomain.example.com) from another DNS provider, you must replace the existing name server (NS) records and replace them with a name server record for each of the name servers that are provided by CIS.",
