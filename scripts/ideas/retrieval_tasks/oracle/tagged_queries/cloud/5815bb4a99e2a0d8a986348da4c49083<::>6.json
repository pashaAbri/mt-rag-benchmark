There are differences between them. Dynamic secrets have their expiration date and time enforced when their secret data is read or accessed, while static secrets have their expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. With a Secrets Manager, you can create, lease, and centrally manage secrets that are used in IBM Cloud services or your custom-built applications.\n|user|: Which one protects more from vulnerabilities?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets have their own ways of protecting against vulnerabilities. Secrets that you create in Secrets Manager can be static or dynamic in nature. A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a dynamic secret has its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.

The key difference lies in when this enforcement occurs. For static secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, for dynamic secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced when the secret data is read or accessed.

An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running. You can develop and deploy Spark SQL, data transformation, data science, or machine learning jobs using the Spark application API.\n* What are the advantages of IBM Analytics Engine serverless instances?\n\nWith IBM Analytics Engine serverless, compute and memory resources are allocated on demand when Spark workloads are deployed. When an application is not in running state, no computing resources are allocated to the IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the instance, billed on a per second basis.\n* Does the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark support Hadoop?\n\nNo, currently, the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark only supports Apache Spark.\n* Can I change the instance home storage of a serverless instance?\n\nNo, you can't. After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries. Changing instance home would result in the loss of the Spark history data and custom libraries.\n* How is user management and access control managed in a serverless instance?\n\nUser management and access control of an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance and its APIs is done through IBM Cloud® Identity and Access Management (IAM). You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges. See [Granting permissions to users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless).\n* How do I define the size of the cluster to run my Spark application?\n\nYou can specify the size of the cluster either at the time the instance is created or when submitting Spark applications.",
