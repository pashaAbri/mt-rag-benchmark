These features help ensure security compliance and data integrity. Additionally, you can leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect malicious attacks and suspicious usage patterns. As for access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies that you assign users depend on what you want your users to be able to do.
