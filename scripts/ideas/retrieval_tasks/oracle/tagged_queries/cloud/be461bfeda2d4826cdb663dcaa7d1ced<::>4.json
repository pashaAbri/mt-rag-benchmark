Moreover  Tags are case-sensitive, and the maximum length of a tag is 128 characters.  The characters that are permitted to name tags are A-Z, 0-9, spaces, underscore, hyphen, period, and colon. Colons turn the tag into a string where you can isolate two logical parts, like a key:value pair. You can't use a colon in a tag without creating this pairing. A comma separate tags and can't be used within the tag name itself. If you add PII information in the name, you might be disclosing sensitive data to others in the same account.When you define your tags, do not add sensitive information in the tag name.Tags are visible to all members of an account.To control tag visibility, circulate tagging guidelines, and let users know that tags are visible account-wide.

You can tag related resources and view them throughout your account by filtering by tags from your resource list.\n\nTo see a full list of tags in your account, go to Manage > Account in the IBM Cloud® console, and select Tags.\n\nYou can apply user tags to organize your resources and service IDs and easily find them later. User tags can also help you with identifying specific team usage or cost allocation. By creating access management tags, you can control access to your resources and service IDs without requiring updates to your IAM policies.\n\n\n\n Tagging rules \n\nTags are not case-sensitive, and the maximum length of a tag is 128 characters. The permitted characters are A-Z, 0-9, spaces, underscore, hyphen, period, and colon. The only supported format for access management tags is key:value. The use of a colon formats the tag into a string that isolates two logical parts, like a env:dev pair. A comma separates multiple tags and can't be used within the tag name itself.\n\nTags are visible account-wide and can be replicated across geographic regions. Since tags are not regulated information, avoid creating tags that use personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, or other identifying or proprietary information.\n\n\n\n Sample tags and syntax \n\nYou can apply tags to help you organize and manage your resources, service IDs, and access policies. Consider writing tags as key:value pairs to help coordinate your development environments, projects, compliance, and optimization throughout your organization. See the following table for some examples of tags that you might want to use.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Tag syntax\n\n Tag Description \n\n env:dev, env:test, env:stage, env:prod Use to identify or even manage access to your development environment \n project:lw-wizard, app:poc-app Use to identify or even manage access to a project \n dataresidency:germany, compliance:hipaa, compliance:pii Use to define compliance requirements",

        "text": "\nTagging objects in IBM Cloud Object Storage \n\nYour data can be expressly defined, categorized, and classified in IBM Cloud® Object Storage using associated metadata, called \"tags.\" This document will show you how to take full control in \"tagging\" the objects representing your data.\n\n\n\n Objects and metadata \n\nOrganizing your data can be a complex task. Basic methods, such as using key prefixes like organizational \"folders\" are a great start to hierarchical structures. But for more complex organization, you will need custom \"\n\ntags.\" Your metadata can describe the relationships inherent to your data, and provide more organization than titles or folders. Unlike mere labels, there are two parts to a tag: a key and a value, defined individually according to your needs.\n\n\n\n Tagging Objects \n\nManaging tags describing your objects can be performed through various interfaces and architectures. Using the [Console](https://cloud.ibm.com) provides a graphical user interface. Using the command line requires tools like [curl](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-curl) and the knowledge of how it interacts with Object Storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nYou need:\n\n\n\n* An [IBM Cloud® Platform account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login)\n* An [instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-provision) and a bucket created for this purpose\n* An [IAM API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage/iam?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam-overview) with Writer access to your Object Storage bucket or instance\n* Either existing or new objects that will have tags applied to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading tags \n\nTags are accessible throughout an instance with the proper permissions. While the true organizational power of using tags as an organizational principle scales with you, you can access tags on an individual basis as well.",
