For example, if the annotation task is focused on labeling parts of speech, you might expect to see a high score because of how well-defined the parts of speech are.

Because you annotated only two entity types in this tutorial, most of the entity type scores are N/A (not applicable), which means no information is available to give a score.\n\nFigure 1. Reviewing inter-annotator scores with users named dave and phil\n\n![This screen capture shows the inter-annotator scores for a task.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/148d3bd95f946aa1bb53ea1540475f522e6b61c9/watson-knowledge-studio-data/images/wks_tutiaa2.png)\n4. After you review the scores, you can decide whether you want to approve or reject document sets that are in the SUBMITTED status. Take one of these actions:\n\n\n\n* If the scores are acceptable for an annotation set, select the check box and click Accept. Documents that do not overlap with other document sets are promoted to ground truth. Documents that do overlap must first be reviewed through adjudication so that conflicts can be resolved. For this tutorial, accept both document sets.\n* If the scores are not acceptable for an annotation set, select the check box and click Reject. The document set needs to be revisited by the human annotator to improve the annotations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Results \n\nWhen you evaluated the inter-annotator agreement scores, you saw how different pairs of human annotators annotated the same document. If the inter-annotator agreement score was acceptable, you accepted the document set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lesson 6: Adjudicating conflicts in annotated documents \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to adjudicate conflicts in documents that overlap between document sets in Knowledge Studio.\n\n\n\n About this task \n\nWhen you approve a document set, only the documents that do not overlap with other document sets are promoted to ground truth. If a document is part of the overlap between multiple document sets, you must adjudicate any annotation conflicts before the document can be promoted to ground truth.",
