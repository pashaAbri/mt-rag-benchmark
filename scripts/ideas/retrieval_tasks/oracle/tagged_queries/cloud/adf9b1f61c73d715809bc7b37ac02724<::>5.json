For example, you might want to upgrade or reduce your pricing plan. You can update the service's pricing plan from the service instance dashboard.\n\nAre you looking for details about upgrading your account type? See [Upgrading your account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account) for more information.\n\nYou can update the pricing plan only for certain services. If plan updates are enabled for the service, a Plan option is displayed on the service instance dashboard. Each service has a different set of steps to follow if you update your plan.\n\n\n\n Updating a plan in the console \n\n\n\n1. From the IBM Cloud console, click the Navigation Menu icon ![Navigation Menu icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/9713d864488177dc6b273b53b7f2383a81f10bc1/icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > Resource List, and select the service.\n2. Click Plan in the service instance dashboard. Select the pricing plan that you want, and click Save.\n\nSome services have pricing plans that are not selectable from the Plan page. Typically, these plans aren't selectable because they require assistance from the IBM Cloud Sales team or they require a migration before you can update plans. See the documentation for the specific service for information about the required next steps.\n\n\n\nDepending on the type of plan updates you make, your next steps can vary. For example, if you reduced the pricing plan, restart your app. Or, if you upgraded the pricing plan, you might need to restart your app, and then take other actions.\n\nComplete the following steps to restart your app:\n\n\n\n1.
