Red Hat OpenShift clusters build on Kubernetes container orchestration that offers consistency and flexibility for your development lifecycle operations.\n\nYour Red Hat OpenShift workloads can scale across IBM’s global footprint of data centers and multizone regions. At the same time, you’re able to uniformly monitor, log, and secure apps. Because IBM manages the service, you can focus on innovating with high-value IBM Cloud services and middleware, such as AI and analytics. You also have access to Red Hat packaged open-source tools, including your favorite app runtimes, frameworks, databases, and more.\n\nReady to get started? Try out the [creating a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_tutorial).\n\nChoice of container platform provider\n: Deploy clusters with Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes installed as the container platform orchestrator.\n: Choose the developer experience that fits your company, or run workloads across both Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes clusters.\n: Built-in integrations from the IBM Cloud console to the Kubernetes dashboard or Red Hat OpenShift web console.\n: Single view and management experience of all your Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes clusters from IBM Cloud.",
