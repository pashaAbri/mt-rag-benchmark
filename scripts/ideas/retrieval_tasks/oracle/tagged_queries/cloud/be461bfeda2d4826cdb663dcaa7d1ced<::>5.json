For instance  ordering node  that collects transactions from network members, orders the transactions and bundles them into blocks. Also known as orderer. Another one is Peer that is a blockchain network resource that provides the services to execute and validate transactions, and maintain ledgers. The peer runs smart contract and is the holder of transaction history and the current state of assets on ledgers. They are owned and managed by organizations and are joined to channels.  Additionally to those two, CA is another node that  issues certificates to all network participants (peers, ordering services, clients, admins, and so on). These certificates, which include a signing certificate and private key, allow network participants to communicate, authenticate, and ultimately transact. These CAs will create all of the identities and certificates that belong to your organization, in addition to defining the organization itself. You can then use those identities to deploy nodes, create admin identities, and submit transactions.                   ",

Ordering nodes contain the cryptographic identity material that is tied to each member and authenticate the identity of clients and peers to access the network.

This number is a majority of the total number of nodes in the consenter set of the channel. In other words, if you have one node, you need that node available to have a quorum, because the majority of one is one.",

        "text": "\nA CA is the node that issues certificates to all network participants (peers, ordering services, clients, admins, and so on). These certificates, which include a signing certificate and private key, allow network participants to communicate, authenticate, and ultimately transact. These CAs will create all of the identities and certificates that belong to your organization, in addition to defining the organization itself. You can then use those identities to deploy nodes, create admin identities, and submit transactions. For more information about your CA and the identities that you will need to create, see [Managing identities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-identitiesibp-console-identities).\n\nIn this tutorial, we will create one organization. Therefore, we will need to create one CA.\n\n\n\n Creating your peer organization CA \n\nYour CA issues the certificates and private keys for your organization's admins, client applications, and nodes. These identities are not managed by IBM and the keys are not stored in the console. They are only stored in your browser local storage. Therefore, make sure to export your identities and the MSP of your organization. If you attempt to access the console from a different machine or a different browser, you will need to import these identities and organization definitions.\n\nPerform the following steps from your console:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Nodes tab on the left and click Add Certificate Authority. The side panels will allow you to customize the CA that you want to create and the organization that this CA will issue keys for.\n2. In this tutorial, we're creating nodes, so make sure the option to Create a Certificate Authority is selected. Then click Next.\n3. Use the side panel to give your CA a display name. Our recommended value for this CA is Org2 CA. Then give your CA admin credentials by specifying a CA administrator enroll ID of admin and a secret of adminpw.\n4. The Advanced deployment options are only available in paid clusters and can be safely ignored for purposes of this tutorial. For more information about these options, see the links below.",
