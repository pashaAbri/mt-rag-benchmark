It combines traditional machine learning, transfer learning, and deep learning techniques in a cohesive model that is highly responsive at run time. For more information, see [Improved intent recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intent-detection).\n\n\n\n\n\n 3 November 2020 \n\nSuggestions are now generally available\n: The Suggestions feature that is available for the web chat integration is generally available and is enabled by default when you create a new web chat integration. For more information, see [Showing more suggestions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-alternate).\n\nNew languages supported by the dialog analysis notebook\n: The Dialog skill analysis notebook was updated with language support for French, German, Spanish, Czech, Italian, and Portuguese. For more information, see [Analysis notebooks](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-logs-resourceslogs-resources-jupyter-logs).\n\nVisit the learning center!\n: Click the Learning center link that is displayed in the header of the skill pages to find helpful product tours. The tours guide you through the steps to follow to complete a range of tasks, from adding your first intent to a dialog skill to enhancing the conversation in an actions skill. The Additional resources page has links to relevant documentation topics and how-to videos. You can search the resource link titles to find what you're looking for quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n 29 October 2020 \n\nSystem entity support changes\n: For English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills only the new system entities API version is supported. For backward compatibility, both the interpretation and metadata attributes are included with the recognized entity object. The new system entity version is enabled automatically for dialog skills in the Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages. You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page.",

You can deploy one version to production, while you continue to make and test improvements that you make to another version of the skill. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-versions). \n Slots A special set of fields that you can add to a dialog node that enable the assistant to collect necessary pieces of information from the customer. For example, the assistant can require a customer to provide valid date and location details before it gets weather forecast information on the customer's behalf. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slots). \n Step A step that you add to an action represents a single interaction or exchange of information with a customer, a turn in the conversation.
