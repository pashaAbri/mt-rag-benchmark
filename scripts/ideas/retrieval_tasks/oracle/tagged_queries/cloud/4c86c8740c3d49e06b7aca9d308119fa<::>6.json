        "text": "\nFAQs \n\nReview frequently asked questions (FAQs) for using IBM Cloud® Kubernetes Service.\n\n\n\n What is Kubernetes? \n\nKubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services across multiple hosts, and offers managements tools for deploying, automating, monitoring, and scaling containerized apps with minimal to no manual intervention. All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).",
