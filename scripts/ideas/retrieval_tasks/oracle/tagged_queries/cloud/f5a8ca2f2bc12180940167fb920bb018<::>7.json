Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.",

You provide information about the subjects or tasks that your users need help with, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n* Actions skill : Offers a simple interface where anyone can build a conversational flow for your assistant to follow. The complex process of training data creation occurs behind the scenes automatically. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-addskill-add-actions-skill)\n* Dialog skill: Offers a set of editors that you use to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree. You use the graphical dialog editor to create a script of sorts for your assistant to read from when it interacts with your customers. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses.

Click on the Dialog tab and then click Create dialog. When you open the dialog editor for the first time, the Welcome and Anything else nodes will be created for you.\n2. To add a custom node, click on the \"More\" icon on the Welcome node and select Add node below.\n3. In the \"If assistant recognizes\" field, enter a condition that, when met, triggers your assistant to process the node. This is typically an intent that you have previously defined.\n4. Specify the response for the node. This is the utterance that your assistant uses to respond to the user.\n5. Save your progress.\nRemember, the dialog matches intents (what users say) to responses (what the bot says back) and can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\nRegarding your question about dialogue skills, they are necessary for your assistant to have the training data and dialog that it uses to communicate with customers. A dialog skill contains the artifacts that define a conversation flow.\nTherefore, to answer your last question, you can create custom dialog nodes within a dialog skill to handle specific user intents and provide appropriate responses."
