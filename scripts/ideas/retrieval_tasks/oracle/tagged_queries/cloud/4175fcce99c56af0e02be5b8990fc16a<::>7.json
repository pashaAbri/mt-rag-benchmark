The software-defined networking (SDN) and virtual network functions allow you to set up the necessary network structures quickly and on-premises connectivity for running your workload. A VPC remains private by default, but it can be configured to enable public connectivity, such as through a public gateway or floating IP. With VPC, you can:\n- Create a software-defined network (SDN)\n- Isolate workloads\n- Have fine control over inbound and outbound traffic",

The underlying software defined networking (SDN) and virtual network functions allows you to quickly establish the network constructs and on-prem connectivity needed to run your workload. The information contained within this document is meant to serve as a technical guide for beginning with a new IBM Cloud Account and leading towards a fully configured VPC network environment.\n\nWelcome to the Deployment Journey for VPC on IBM Cloud! Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between the journey points.\n\n\n\n Journey Map \n\n![Architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/d50364af907081c3c38f99c11f35dd9cab4b2510/vpc-journey/images/overview/journey-map.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n Assumptions \n\nThis deployment guide will be assuming the following points. Please note that while your circumstance may not be exactly identical, you will still benefit from the overall journey steps and concepts covered in this guide.\n\n\n\n* You are already familar with the concepts introduced in the \"Tour IBM Cloud\" videos available on the [Getting Started with IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/cloud/get-started) page.\n* Access groups will need to be defined so only certain users have the ability to create and manage the VPC network settings (i.e. CIDR ranges, Subnet ACL rules, etc.,).\n* You have a networking background and familar with concepts such as IP Addressing, subnets, routing, etc.,\n* Focus will be on establishing the underlying network connectivity to support VPC based workloads.\n\n\n\n* Note: A separate deployment guide will cover the compute resources which runs within the VPC like IBM Kubernetes Services (IKS), Red Hat OpenShift, IBM Code Engine, and VPC Virtual Server Instances (VSIs).",
