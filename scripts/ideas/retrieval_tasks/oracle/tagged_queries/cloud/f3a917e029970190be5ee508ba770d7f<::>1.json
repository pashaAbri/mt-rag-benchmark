See [Transition to Enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-transitioning-next-plan).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I delete my CIS instance? \n\nTo delete a CIS instance, you must first delete all global load balancers, pools, and health checks. Then delete the associated domain (zone). Go to the Overview page and click the trash can icon next to the domain name located in the Service Details section to start the deletion process.\n\nIf you are moving your domain to a different provider, be sure to migrate your DNS records and other configuration information to the new provider before activating the domain there. Activating the domain before migrating from CIS can cause your domain to changed to a [Moved state](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-domain-moved-status).\n\n\n\n\n\n I added a user to my account and gave that user permission to manage Internet Services instance(s). Why is that user facing authentication issues? \n\nIt's possible that you did not assign \"service access roles\" to the user. Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.",
