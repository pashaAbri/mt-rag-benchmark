A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google’s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action. Enter (cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed) into the Expression preview section as a singular rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations \n\n\n\n* If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n\n\n\n* Ensure that anything under /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/ is allowed.",

A bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt fileand read them and avoid that webpage. They can also can be added to an allowlist. In the other hand, Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.Furthermore,anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.   \n|user|: What are the features in the CIS bot?\n|assistant|: I do not have much information about  that but  IBM Cloud® Internet Services (CIS) bot features include JavaScript detections.

CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n|user|: How does CIS manage bots?\n|assistant|: Cloudflare Bot Management, which is part of IBM Cloud® Internet Services (CIS), manages bots by collecting data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules. The detection mechanisms used by CIS produce their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score.\n|user|: How can I update machine leaning models?\n|assistant|: You  can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.To enable auto-updates:Log in to the CIS and select your account and domain Go toSecurity > Bots.    Select Configure Bot Management.  Enable auto-updates to the machine learning model.  Enabling auto-updates for the machine learning model upgrades you to the latest version immediately. You can toggle the button off within 24 hours to revert to the previous version. To make changes after 24 hours, contact support.  Indeed it is very important to update the machine because not updating to the latest version, you will be using a machine learning model that is no longer maintained or monitored by the engineering team. As internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, the scoring accuracy of older versions can degrade.\n|user|: Can I create a machine learning model and how should I do that?\n|assistant|: I can give you information about how create a machine learning model in Knowledge Studio. It involves training the machine learning model and evaluating how well the model performed when annotating test data and blind data.    By exploring the performance metrics, you can identify ways to improve the model's accuracy.  Restriction: Only three machine learning models can be trained at a time per Knowledge Studio instance. If your instance contains multiple workspaces and the number of machine learning models that are being trained in other workspaces totals 3 already, then your request to train the machine learning model in your workspace will be queued until the other training processes are done.  It is important to note that . Only documents that became ground truth through approval or adjudication can be used to train the machine learning model. Always have in mind  to create a machine learning model that trains a model you can use to identify entities, coreferences, and relationships of interest in new documents.Knowledge Studio provides a rules editor that simplifies the process of finding and capturing common patterns in your documents as rules. You can then create a model that recognizes the rule patterns, and deploy it for use in other services.\n|user|: Speaking about bots again, can they get private information from the user"

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.
