The script instantiates a unique instance of your assistant. You can then copy and paste the HTML script element into any page or pages on your website where you want users to be able to ask your assistant for help.\n\n\n\n Create a web chat instance to add to your website \n\nTo add the assistant to a web page on your company website, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the Assistants page, click to open the assistant tile that you want to deploy to your site.\n2. From the Integrations section, click the Web chat tile.\n3. Optional: Change the web chat integration name from Web chat to something more descriptive.\n4. Click Create to create a web chat instance.\n5. Optional: Customize the style of the chat window. You can make the following changes:\n\n\n\n* Public assistant name. Name by which the assistant is known to users. This name is displayed in the header of the chat window. The name can be up to 18 characters in length.\n* Primary color. Sets the color of the web chat header.\n\nClick the white dot to open a color switcher where you can choose a color. The color is saved as an HTML color code, such as FF33FC for pink and 329A1D for green. Alternatively, you can add an HTML color code directly to the field to set the color.\n* Secondary color: Sets the color of the user input message bubble.\n* Accent color. Sets the color of interactive elements, including:\n\n\n\n* Chat launcher button that is embedded in your web page\n* Send button associated with the input text field\n* Input text field border when in focus\n* Marker that shows the start of the assistant’s response\n* Border of a button after it is clicked\n* Border of the drop-down list field as the user chooses an option\n* Typing indicator that is shown to repesent a pause response",

The responses from your assistant are defined by you and can be written in any language you want.\n\nHowever, some of the phrases that are displayed in the web chat widget are part of the web chat itself and do not come from the assistant. By default, these hardcoded phrases are specified in English, but you can apply a different language by adding lines to the embedded web chat script.\n\nThe hardcoded phrases used by the web chat widget are specified in language pack files. The web chat provides language packs that contain translations of each English-language phrase that is used by the web chat. You can instruct the web chat to use one of these other languages files by using the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nLikewise, the web chat applies an American English locale to content that is added by the web chat unless you specify something else. The locale setting affects how values such as dates and times are formatted.\n\nTo configure the web chat for customers outside the US, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1.  To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.  To change only the language of the hardcoded English phrases, use the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nFor more information, see [Instance methods](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslanguages).\n3.  To change the text direction of the page from right to left, use the direction method.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.",
