    "text": "I am unable to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of cloud computing security protocols over time, but I can inform you about specific security features and practices related to restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC. These features include data inheritance, encryption, and cross-regional backup copies, all of which contribute to a more secure and resilient cloud computing environment. Backup snapshots can be utilized to restore volumes in a different region for business continuity or geographic expansion purposes. The restoration of volumes from backup snapshots can be performed through the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform. By using the backup service, you can regularly back up your volume data based on a schedule you set up, with the option to create backup snapshots as frequently as every hour.",

        "text": "\nBy using the [backup service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about), you can regularly back up your volume data based on a schedule that you set up. You can create backup snapshots as frequently as 1 hour. However, the backup service does not provide continual backup with automatic failover, and restoring a volume from a backup or snapshot is a manual operation that takes time. If you require a higher level of service for automatic disaster recovery, see IBM's [Cloud disaster recovery solutions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/disaster-recovery).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is restoring a volume from a snapshot? \n\nRestoring from a snapshot creates a new, fully provisioned boot or data volume. You can restore storage volumes during instance creation, instance modification, or when you provision a new stand-alone volume. For data volumes, you can also use the volumes API to create a data volume from a snapshot. For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a snapshot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore).\n\nFor best performance, you can enable snapshots for fast restore. By using the fast restore feature, you can create a volume from a snapshot that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. For more information, see [Snapshots fast restore](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-aboutsnapshots_vpc_fast_restore).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I add tags to a volume? \n\nYes, you can add user tags and access management tags to your volumes. User tags are used by the backup service to automatically create backup snapshots of the volume. Access management tags help organize access to your Block Storage for VPC volumes. For more information, see [Tags for Block Storage for VPC volumes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=uistorage-about-tags).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Performance questions",

You can restore volumes during instance creation or when you want to create stand-alone boot or data volumes to be used later. You can restore a data volume to add more storage to an existing instance. You can use backup snapshots to restore volumes in a different region for business continuity purposes or geographic expansion. You can restore volumes from backup snapshots in the UI, from the CLI, with the API, or Terraform.\n\n\n\n About restoring a volume from a backup snapshot \n\nWhen you restore a volume from a backup, the service creates another volume. The restored volume inherits the same [profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), capacity, data, and metadata as the original volume. However, you can choose a different profile and capacity if you prefer. If the source volume used [customer-managed encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-customer-managed-encryption), the new volume inherits that encryption.\n\nRestoring a volume from a backup snapshot creates a boot or data volume, depending on whether the snapshot is bootable or nonbootable. The volume appears first as pending while it's being created. During the restoration, your data is copied from IBM Cloud® Object Storage to Block Storage for VPC. After the volume is hydrated (fully provisioned), you can use the new boot or data volume. For more information about how performance is affected during restoration, see [Performance impact when backup snapshots are used](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restorebaas-performance-considerations).\n\nFor best performance, use backups with fast restore. You can enable fast restore backup snapshots in multiple zones and use them to restore a volume that is fully provisioned when the volume is created.",

    "original_text": "The evolution of cloud computing security protocols is influenced by various factors such as advancements in technology, changing threat landscapes, and regulatory requirements. These developments can impact the process of restoring volumes from backup snapshots in IBM Cloud VPC in several ways.\nFirstly, enhanced security measures might lead to more complex backup and restoration processes. This could mean additional steps or requirements when restoring volumes, such as multi-factor authentication or stricter access controls.\nSecondly, improvements in data encryption techniques could affect the restoration of volumes. For instance, the introduction of new encryption standards might require updates to the restoration process to ensure compatibility.\nThirdly, changes in legal and regulatory requirements could impact the restoration of volumes. For example, new data protection laws might necessitate additional checks or verifications during the restoration process.\nHowever, the provided documents do not contain specific information on how cloud computing security protocols have evolved over time in IBM Cloud VPC, nor do they detail the exact implications for restoring volumes from backup snapshots.
