This doesn't apply to human annotations, which are preserved regardless of pre-annotation order.\n\nFor example, consider the example text IBM Watson. If a dictionary that is first in the order labels IBM as an Organization entity type, a machine learning model that is second in the order can't annotate IBM Watson as a Software Brand entity type because that would override the earlier annotation made to IBM.\n\nYou can view the current order of pre-annotators in the Order column on the Machine Learning Model > Pre-annotation page.
