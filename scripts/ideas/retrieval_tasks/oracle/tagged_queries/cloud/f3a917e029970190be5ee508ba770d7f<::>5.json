    "text": "Yes. Data privacy is upheld through the use of private data collections. For example, multiple wholesalers and a group of farmers can be connected to a single channel. If a farmer and a wholesaler want to conduct a private transaction, they can create a channel for this purpose. Alternatively, they can choose to establish a private data collection on the smart contract governing their business interactions to maintain privacy regarding sensitive aspects of the sale, such as the price, without the need to create an additional channel. This policy applies to EU-US and Swiss-US customers. If a government wants access to data held by IBM on behalf of a SaaS client, IBM expects that government to deal directly with that client. Data privacy and governance are of utmost importance. As a leader in providing a fully managed and globally distributable Database-as-a-Service, IBM® Cloudant® for IBM Cloud® allows customers to position data in any global IBM Cloud® or AWS region. By providing customers with high levels of data mobility to meet their local needs, IBM® and IBM Cloudant take data privacy and governance seriously. IBM Cloud Delivery Services does not use DLP monitoring. Access controls are implemented on all databases restricted to privileged users only.",

For example, several wholesalers and a set of farmers might be joined to a single channel. If a farmer and a wholesaler want to transact privately, they can create a channel for this purpose. But they can also decide to create a private data collection on the smart contract that governs their business interactions to maintain privacy over sensitive aspects of the sale, such as the price, without having to create a secondary channel. To learn more about when to use private data within a blockchain, visit the [Private Data](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data/private-data.htmlprivate-data) concept article in the Fabric documentation.\n\nIn order to use private data with IBM Blockchain Platform, the following three conditions must be satisfied:\n\n\n\n1. Define the private data collection. A private data collection file can be added to your smart contract. Then, at run time, your client application can use private data-specific chaincode APIs to input and retrieve data from the collection. For more information about how to use private data collections with your smart contract, see the Fabric SDK tutorial on [Using private data](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/tutorial-private-data.html) in the Fabric SDK documentation.\n2. Deploy the smart contract. After you define the smart contract private data collection, you need to install the smart contract on the peers that are members of the channel. When you instantiate the smart contract on the channel by using the console, you need to upload the collection configuration JSON file. For more information on how to [create a collection definition JSON file](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/tutorial-private-data.html) see the Fabric SDK documentation topic.",
