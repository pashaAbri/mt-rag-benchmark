Documents are also containers for your data, and are the basis of the IBM® Cloudant® for IBM Cloud® database.\n\nIf you're using an [IBM Cloudant service on IBM Cloud®](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public), documents are limited to a maximum size of 1 MB. Exceeding this limit causes a [413 error](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).\n\nIBM Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem) model for data. If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field. The _id field is detailed in the next section.\n* A _rev field. The _rev field is a revision identifier, and is [essential to the IBM Cloudant replication protocol](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-document-versioning-and-mvccdocument-versioning-and-mvcc).\n\n\n\nIn addition to these two mandatory fields, documents can generally contain any other content that can be described by using JSON, subject to some caveats detailed in the following sections.\n\n\n\n Document IDs",
