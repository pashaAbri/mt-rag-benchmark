Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.",

Actions offer step-by-step flows for a conversations and are made so that anybody can build them. A search skill is configured to search the appropriate external data sources for answers to customer questions. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add). \n Skill version Versions are snapshots of a skill that you can create at key points during the development lifecycle. You can deploy one version to production, while you continue to make and test improvements that you make to another version of the skill. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-versions). \n Slots A special set of fields that you can add to a dialog node that enable the assistant to collect necessary pieces of information from the customer. For example, the assistant can require a customer to provide valid date and location details before it gets weather forecast information on the customer's behalf. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-slots). \n Step A step that you add to an action represents a single interaction or exchange of information with a customer, a turn in the conversation. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-actions-overviewactions-overview-steps). \n System entity Prebuilt entities that recognize references to common things like dates and numbers. You can add these to your skill and start using them immediately. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities). \n Try it out A chat window that you use to test as you build. For example, from the dialog skill's \"Try it out\" pane, you can mimic the behavior of a customer and enter a query to see how the assistant responds. You can test only the current skill; you cannot test your assistant and all attached skills from end to end.",
