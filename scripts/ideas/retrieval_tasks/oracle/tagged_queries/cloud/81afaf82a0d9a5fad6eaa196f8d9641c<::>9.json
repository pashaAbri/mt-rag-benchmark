After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, or hard deleted, and its associated data will be permanently removed from the Key Protect service.\nAlso, keep in mind that deleting a key will make any data encrypted by the key inaccessible. If the key is restored within the 30-day time frame, this can be reversed. However, after 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged. Once a key is no longer restorable and has been purged, its associated data can no longer be accessed.\n|user|: what happen when the first user authorizes a key for deletion?\n|assistant|: When the first user authorizes a key for deletion, it remains in the Active state for seven days.

All key operations will still be allowed on the key. The key and its associated data will continue to be accessible and will not be moved to the Destroyed state. No further action can be taken to delete the key until the first user authorizes deletion again.\n|user|: In case, the server expired, Could I remove the entry from the resource list?\n|assistant|: In case  the server expire, you indeed can remove  the entry from the resource list and also  wait for the target time to trigger deletion for you, or even manually trigger the deletion from the resource reclamations.If an expired server is restored, only the entry within the resource list is restored, not the server itself.Restoring servers that belong to paid plans\nServers that belong to a paid plans do not expire, and that's why they can be restored during the reclamation period. If a server is restored, the timeframe for which the server was within the resource reclamations is billed to your account. After the server is deleted, only metadata, which isn't considered to be personal data is kept for 6 months. Make sure you back up important data for future use because you can't recover data after the virtual server has been deleted.\n\n\n|user|: Why could not I delete keys?\n|assistant|: One of the reason you could not delete a key it is when you are using the the Hyper Protect Crypto Services user interface. The service was not able to delete key \"<key_name>\". Because the key is enabled with the dual authorization policy and you set the key for deletion, a second approver needs to continue with the key deletion operation. Note that you will not be able to delete the key if it is protecting a registered IBM Cloud resource that's non-erasable due to a retention policy.\n\n\n|user|: What could happen if I force a deletion on a key?\n|assistant|: If you force a deletion on a key won't succeed if the key is protecting a registered IBM Cloud resource that's non-erasable due to a retention policy, which is a Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy set on the your IBM Cloud resource. You can verify whether a key is associated with a non-erasable resource by checking the 'preventKeyDeletion\" field in the registration details for the key. Then, you must contact an account owner to remove the retention policy on each registered IBM Cloud resource that is associated with the key before you can delete the key. However, You must use the force option to delete a root key that is registered with another cloud resource.\nRegistrations are associations between root keys and other cloud resources, such as Cloud Object Storage (COS) buckets or Cloud Databases deployments.\n|user|:  Cryptoshredding .\n|assistant|: The Cryptoshredding Key Protect provides for a force delete of a key that is in use by IBM Cloud® services, including your Cloud Databases deployments. This action is called cryptoshredding.Note that Cryptoshredding is a destructive action.

Here are some considerations:Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) Evaluate your IAM access permissions to create and manage backups. Volumes Evaluate which volumes are most important to back up. You can create backups of boot and data volumes. A volume with numerous changes and a lengthy retention period requires more attention than a volume with moderate changes. Also, the cumulative size of all backups for a volume can't exceed 10 TB. Backup schedule Determine a backup schedule based on the type of volumes that you're backing up. For example, you might want to back up critical data that changes frequently more often than static data. Retention Determine a retention policy for backups in the backup plan. As subsequent backups are created, keep in mind that you incur costs for each backup that you retain.  You do your first backup  with a seed( a complete , a full backup)using  Delta Technology. With this technology, \"full backups\" are created at each session, but it saves enormous amounts of space on the vault and decreases the amount of time each subsequent backup takes to complete.

Use this disaster recovery kit during an incident response to restore services.\n\n\n\n Infrastructure as code \n\nInfrastructure as code ensures that good backup practices are implemented in a uniform way across the organization. Include implementation of backups as part of deployable architectures. Keep backup configuration close to provisioning code so that it is easier to ensure that backups are adjusted as information system changes occur. Create and configure backup accounts as code.\n\n\n\n\n\n Backup accounts \n\nEach BU account group should include a separate backup account and an additional backup account should be used for the centralized accounts. These backup accounts provide an extra layer of protection for the confidentiality and integrity of the backed up data. If credentials to a source account are compromised, it should not be possible to use that access to tamper with backups.\n\nSupporting this effort, authorization to backup data in the backup account should use service-to-service or service to trusted profile authorization where possible. Otherwise, use secure storage of credentials with least privilege access.\n\nIf you are using Cloud Object Storage for backup, at minimum, use separate buckets for backing up different workload accounts. Also, use separate backup credentials for each bucket where service to service policies are not possible. Use Cloud Object Storage versioning or [immutable buckets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-immutable) for maximum security.\n\nServices that provide built in backup facilities might have limitations regarding backup accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n Service-specific considerations \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Databases \n\n[IBM Cloud Databases](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-about) provide automatic daily backups that are stored in the same account and geography. Backups are typically stored in [cross-regional storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-dashboard-backups&interface=uibackup-locations) and should therefore be immune to a single region outage.",

There are different types of disaster recovery testing that you can do to verify your resiliency capabilities:\n\n\n\n* DR dry test\n* DR simulation\n* Switch-over\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery dry test \n\nA DR dry test is performed by checking all of the resource availability and runbooks on paper, without running a real DR simulation or switch-over.\n\nThis type of testing is normally run with higher frequency compared to the other testing flavors as no real activities are performed, but it does require the same effort in terms of skills and people.\n\nThe adoption of a recovery orchestrator software improves the whole dry testing process and reduces the time and effort to be run because most of the operations are performed by the software itself. This also increases the preparedness checking of a real DR simulation or switch-over by periodic scanning that all of the components of the DR solutions are in place and works as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery simulation \n\nDR simulation is a way to verify or audit the emergency runbooks and check the\n\nrecovery time objectives(RTO) andrecovery point objectives(RPO) provided by the solution by simulating as much as possible in the same conditions as a real emergency.\n\nThis means introducing disruptions on replication network connections before interrupting the communications among the sites, hence simulating the sudden loss of the primary site.\n\nYou can do this only if your data replication solution is resilient and not providing impact on the production, which continues on the primary site. If this is not the case, then look at the documentation for [plan and design for the worst conditions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-drworst-conditions).\n\nDR simulation deploys a duplicate of your production environment on the DR site that you can use to perform validation and checking. This environment is cleaned at the end of the simulation and updates that happened to the DR test environment are discarded, as the real production has continued on the primary site.\n\nIt is important thus that network streams flowing to the DR test environment are copies of the real production environment.",

In the context of cloud computing, Disaster Recovery involves strategies for backing up data, restoring data, and switching over to standby systems when primary systems fail. For example, you can create backups of your Block Storage for VPC volumes, determine a backup schedule based on the type of volumes, and set a retention policy for backups. Additionally, you can use Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) solutions to help protect your critical workloads and applications from downtime and data loss. These solutions typically include features like real-time replication, automatic failover, and recovery testing."
