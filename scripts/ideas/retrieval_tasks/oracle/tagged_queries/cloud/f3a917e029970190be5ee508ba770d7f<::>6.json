You use TLS secrets when working with custom domain mappings.\nTo view the CLI help for creating a TLS secret, run ibmcloud ce secret create --format tls. Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication ensures that traffic is both secure and trusted in both directions between a client and server. It is only available for customers at the Enterprise or Security plan level.\nWhen mTLS is configured, access is only granted to requests with a corresponding client certificate. When a request reaches the application, CIS requests the client certificate. If the client fails to present the certificate, the request is not allowed to proceed. Otherwise, the key exchange continues.",
