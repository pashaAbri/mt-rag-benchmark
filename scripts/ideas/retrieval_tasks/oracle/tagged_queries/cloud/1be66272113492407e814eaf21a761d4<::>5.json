The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud® console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.",
