From the Skills page, click Create skill.\n2. Choose to create either a dialog or actions skill, and then click Next.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).\n3. Name your skill, and optionally add a description. From the Language field, choose Another language.\n\nRemember, if the language you want to support is listed individually, choose it instead of using the universal model. The built-in language models provide optimal language support.\n4. Create the skill.\n5. If your skill will support a language with right-to-left directional text, such as Hebrew, configure the bidirectional capabilities.\n\nClick the options icon from the skill tile ![Skill options icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/kebab.png), and then select Language preferences.

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

The service correctly translates from and to bidirectional languages that are written left-to-right and right-to-left (for example, Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu).\n\nThe service use ISO two-character codes for most languages. It uses an ISO three-character code (cnr) for Montenegrin. In some cases, it uses a two-character language code and a two-character country code separated by a hyphen, such as fr-CA for French Canadian, pa-PK for Punjabi spoken in Pakistan, and zh-TW for traditional (Mandarin) Chinese spoken in Taiwan.\n\nNot all language combinations that are supported for translation are also customizable.
