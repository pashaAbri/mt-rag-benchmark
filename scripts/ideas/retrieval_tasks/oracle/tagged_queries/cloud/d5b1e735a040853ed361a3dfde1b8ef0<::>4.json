Documents are also containers for your data, and are the basis of the IBM® Cloudant® for IBM Cloud® database.\n\nIf you're using an [IBM Cloudant service on IBM Cloud®](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicibm-cloud-public), documents are limited to a maximum size of 1 MB. Exceeding this limit causes a [413 error](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes).\n\nIBM Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem) model for data. If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred. For more information about this model, see the topic on [Consistency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theoremcap-theorem).\n\n\n\n Document fields \n\nAll documents must have two fields:\n\n\n\n* A unique _id field. The _id field is detailed in the next section.\n* A _rev field. The _rev field is a revision identifier, and is [essential to the IBM Cloudant replication protocol](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-document-versioning-and-mvccdocument-versioning-and-mvcc).\n\n\n\nIn addition to these two mandatory fields, documents can generally contain any other content that can be described by using JSON, subject to some caveats detailed in the following sections.\n\n\n\n Document IDs",

All documents must have two fields:\n    * A unique _id field. The _id field is detailed in the next section.\n    * A _rev field. The _rev field is a revision identifier, and is essential to the IBM Cloudant replication protocol.\n2. Field names that begin with the underscore character (_) are reserved in IBM Cloudant. This rule means that you can't normally have your own field names that begin with an underscore. For example, the field example would be accepted, but the field _example would result in a doc_validation error message.\n\n|user|: What if I want to store an image or pdf with a document? \n|assistant|: IBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. So you can easily add an image or PDF as an attachment to your document but you must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you’re looking at larger assets.\n\n1. IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant’s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data. So, slow and expensive. IBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use. As a rule, if you need to store binary data alongside IBM Cloudant documents, it’s better to use a separate solution more suited for this purpose. You need store only the attachment metadata in the IBM Cloudant document.\n|user|: Is there a limit on the file size? "
