Galileo made significant discoveries including evidence for a saltwater ocean beneath Europa's icy surface and extensive volcanic processes on Io. The mission ended in September 2003 when it was intentionally plunged into Jupiter's atmosphere.\n\n2. **Juno** - NASA's current Jupiter orbiter that continues exploring the planet, its ring system, and moons. Juno builds on the discoveries of previous missions and is scheduled to continue its mission through September 2025, when its orbit will naturally degrade and it will be consumed in Jupiter's atmosphere.",

      "rewritten_query": "How are cyclones on Earth formed?",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided documents, cyclones (hurricanes) on Earth form through the following process:\n\n**Initial Formation:**\nTropical cyclones form only over warm ocean waters near the equator, using warm, moist air as fuel. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from the surface, creating an area of lower air pressure below.\n\n**Development Process:**\nAir from surrounding higher pressure areas rushes in to fill the low pressure area. This \"new\" air also becomes warm and moist and rises. As the warm air continues rising and cooling, the water vapor forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, continuously fed by the ocean's heat and evaporating water.\n\n**Rotation and Structure:**\nDue to Earth's rotation, storms north of the equator spin counterclockwise while those south spin clockwise. As the system rotates faster, an eye forms in the center - very calm and clear with low air pressure, where higher pressure air flows down from above.\n\n**Classification:**\nWhen winds reach 39 mph, it becomes a \"tropical storm.\" At 74 mph winds, it officially becomes a \"tropical cyclone\" or hurricane, with categories 1-5 based on wind speed (74 mph to 157+ mph).\n\n**Weakening:**\nTropical cyclones typically weaken upon hitting land since they lose their energy source from warm ocean waters.",

Vaccine stimulates immune response to the virus\n2. Your body makes antibodies that help kill or neutralize the virus\n3. If exposed to COVID-19 later, these antibodies help your immune system recognize and fight the virus quickly\n\n**Important:** None of these vaccines can give you COVID-19 because they use either inactivated virus, harmless pieces of the virus, or genes from the virus - none of which can cause the disease.",

A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\n\n**Check for HTTPS encryption**: Look for \"https://\" at the beginning of the web address or a lock icon in your browser.

It takes about 2 hours to heat up and runs for approximately 1 hour per experiment.\n\n**Operational constraints:** Due to high power consumption, MOXIE runs infrequently (once every 1-2 months) and prevents other rover operations during use.\n\n**Future vision:** MOXIE serves as a technology demonstration for a future \"Big MOXIE\" that would need to produce 2,000-3,000 grams of oxygen per hour to support human missions.",

The soft drink Moxie was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works.\n\nThere are several interesting connections between the Mars instrument and the beverage:\n\n1. The Moxie company was reportedly the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy, while on Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make anything at all.\n\n2. There's even a technical connection - when MOXIE runs, operators must be careful with settings to avoid producing pure carbon instead of carbon monoxide, as this would damage the instrument. This destructive process is called \"coking,\" and the carbon deposit is called \"coke\" - another beverage reference.\n\nThe beverage Moxie can still be purchased in New England and is considered the official drink of Maine.",

Stand with the Sun behind you and hold the foil piece above it (foil facing up).

For example, NASA's Aqua satellite at 705 kilometers takes about 99 minutes to orbit, while weather satellites at 36,000 kilometers take nearly 24 hours.\n\nSpecial orbits include geostationary (satellites stay above the same Earth location) and polar orbits for comprehensive Earth coverage.",

When you look at stars in the night sky, you're seeing other stars within our galaxy.\n\nThere are **many different types of galaxies**:\n- **Spiral galaxies** look like giant pinwheels with curved arms (like our Milky Way)\n- **Elliptical galaxies** are smooth and oval-shaped \n- **Irregular galaxies** have no particular shape and look like blobs\n\nThe universe contains an enormous number of galaxies. The Hubble Space Telescope found **10,000 galaxies** in just a small patch of space observed for 12 days. Scientists estimate there could be **as many as one hundred billion galaxies** in the universe.\n\nGalaxies can sometimes collide with each other. Our Milky Way will eventually bump into the Andromeda galaxy in about five billion years, though the planets and solar systems often don't actually collide due to the vast distances involved.",
