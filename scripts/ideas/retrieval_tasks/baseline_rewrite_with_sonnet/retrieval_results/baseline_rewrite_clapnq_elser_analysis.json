The offense controls an oval-shaped football and attempts to advance by running with or passing the ball, while the defense tries to stop them. Teams must advance at least ten yards in four downs to keep possession.\n\n**Scoring**: In American football, points are scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking through goalposts for a field goal.\n\n**Terminology**: In the United States, American football is simply called \"football,\" while soccer retains the name \"soccer.\" In other English-speaking countries where soccer is more popular, American football requires the qualifier \"American football\" or \"gridiron.\"\n\nThe documents indicate that while both are team sports involving ball control, they have distinctly different rules, equipment, and playing styles.",

More specifically, HIV-1 was initially transmitted from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to humans in the early 1900s in Southeast Cameroon, Africa, through exposure to infected blood and body fluids while butchering bushmeat.\n\n**Timeline**: It's estimated that HIV-1 entered the human population in Africa in the early 1900s, but symptomatic infections were not reported until the 1980s. The disease was first officially recognized on June 5, 1981.\n\n**Regional Spread**: In West Africa specifically, the HIV epidemic began in 1985 with reported cases in Benin and Nigeria, and subsequently spread to nearby countries like Côte d'Ivoire. By the 1990s, AIDS became a significant problem for the West African region, particularly affecting Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Nigeria.\n\n**Global Spread**: HIV-1 was effectively absent from Europe until the late 1980s, indicating the virus remained relatively contained in Africa for several decades before spreading globally.",

One approach involves modifying T-cells so they no longer express CCR5, making them resistant to HIV infection. In laboratory studies, these modified cells eventually dominated cultures when challenged with HIV, as the virus killed unmodified cells.\n\n**Current Treatments**: While not cures, the documents mention that many drugs used to treat HIV have emerged from American pharmaceutical industry laboratories, with basic research funded by the NIH.\n\n**Prevention**: The anti-HIV drug tenofovir, when used topically in vaginal gel, was reported to reduce herpes virus sexual transmission by 51% in 2011.\n\nSo while there is no general cure available, there has been at least one successful case and promising research continues.",

Ampoules are sealed under nitrogen.\n\n**Types of Vaccines:**\n- **Live-attenuated**: Contain weakened forms of the virus that don't cause disease but provide immunity\n- **Killed viruses**: Use inactivated viral particles\n- **Subunit vaccines**: Use only specific viral proteins (antigens), often produced using biotechnology and genetic engineering\n- **Recombinant DNA**: Artificially created in laboratory settings for vaccine development\n\nThe freeze-dried method became the WHO standard for smallpox eradication campaigns, allowing vaccines to remain effective even after 6 months storage at high temperatures.",

This build makes them somewhat pig-like in appearance.\n\n**Size Differences:** Male guinea pigs are about 30% larger than females, though otherwise they don't differ significantly in appearance apart from general size.\n\n**Coat Varieties:** Domesticated guinea pigs come in many breeds with varying hair and color compositions. Common varieties include:\n- English shorthair (American): short, smooth coat\n- Abyssinian: ruffled coat with cowlicks or rosettes\n- Peruvian and Sheltie: straight longhair breeds\n- Texel: curly longhair\n\n**Grooming needs:** Shorthair breeds typically require weekly brushing, while longhair breeds may need daily grooming.\n\n**Temperature tolerance:** Their compact body helps them tolerate cold better than heat, with normal body temperature of 101-104°F.",

Roosevelt's \"primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan\" because \"the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties.\"\n\nThe documents state that \"In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war against Japan, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island.\" This was part of what became known as the Yalta agreement.\n\nLater, when the Soviets invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and captured both Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, the documents note this was done \"pursuant to the Yalta agreement.\"\n\nSo Roosevelt was a key architect of the agreement that promised these territories to the Soviet Union in exchange for their entry into the Pacific war. His primary motivation was avoiding massive American casualties in a potential invasion of Japan by securing Soviet military assistance against Japanese forces.",

The overall trend of declining television ratings in 2012\n2. NBC's lack of promotion - \"NBC didn't promote (the series) one bit\"\n\n**Target audience:**\nThe show's primary demographic was viewers aged 18-49. The season 9 premiere received a 2.1/6 percent share in this key demographic, meaning 2.1% of all 18-49 year-olds watched the episode. For the entire ninth season, the show averaged a 2.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, representing about 3.32 million viewers in this age group.\n\nDespite the decline, The Office often ranked as NBC's highest-rated scripted series on Thursday nights, though it was no longer the network's top-rated scripted comedy overall, having been surpassed by \"Go On.\"",

About 1,000 mountain men from western North Carolina, Tennessee, and southwest Virginia defeated 1,000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson. This victory gave advantage to independence supporters and prevented British recruitment of Loyalists.\n\n**Internal Conflict:**\nFierce guerrilla warfare erupted between pro-independence and pro-British colonists throughout the war, sometimes serving as cover for settling private grudges.\n\n**Cherokee Involvement:**\nIn July 1776, Cherokee allies of Britain attacked North Carolina's western frontier but were defeated.",

Johnston later surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place (present-day Durham) in April 1865.\n\n**Divided Loyalties:**\nNot all North Carolinians supported the Confederacy.

Workers frequently go without income for extended periods, which likely makes it difficult to earn a sustainable living from agricultural work alone.\n\nThe documents also mention that the unorganized sector and microcredit are preferred in rural areas \"especially for non-productive purposes such as short-term loans for ceremonies,\" which may indicate that agricultural workers often need to borrow money to meet their financial needs.\n\nHowever, I do not have specific comprehensive data on agricultural worker incomes or detailed wage information to provide a complete picture of earnings in India's agricultural sector.",

Cashew kernels are commonly used in Indian cuisine for garnishing sweets or curries, or ground into paste for sauces. They're also used in Thai, Chinese, and Filipino cuisines.\n\n**Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL):**\nCNSL, also called cashew shell oil, is a natural resin with a yellowish sheen found in the honeycomb structure of the cashew nutshell. It's a byproduct of processing cashew nuts and serves as raw material for multiple uses including:\n- Developing drugs, antioxidants, and fungicides\n- Biomaterials\n- Tropical folk medicine\n- Anti-termite treatment of timber\n- Lubricants, waterproofing, paints, and arms production\n\nThe shell contains oil compounds that can cause contact dermatitis similar to poison ivy, which is why cashews aren't typically sold in shells to consumers. The composition of CNSL varies depending on processing methods.",

The market was estimated at $600 billion, making it one of the top-five retail markets globally, with projections to reach $1.3 trillion by 2020.\n\n**Market Structure:**\nIndia's retail sector is dominated by traditional formats - local mom-and-pop stores, owner-operated shops, and street vendors. Modern retail supermarkets had only a 4% market share in 2008, though they are expanding.\n\n**Challenges:**\nGrowth faces significant obstacles including lack of back-end warehouse infrastructure, complex regulations (over thirty compliance requirements like \"signboard licences\"), state-level permits, and taxes for moving goods between and within states. These inefficiencies cause a third of agricultural produce to spoil.\n\n**Policy Changes:**\nIn 2012, the government allowed 51% foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail and 100% in single-brand retail to modernize the sector.",

This leads to a significant decrease in the production of blood cells and blood platelets.\n\n**Compromised Immune System**: When bone marrow function is impaired, it results in a depressed immune system, making the body vulnerable to infections and diseases.\n\n**Treatment-Related Damage**: Exposure to radiation or chemotherapy kills many of the rapidly dividing cells in bone marrow, further compromising blood cell production. Many symptoms of radiation poisoning are actually due to damage sustained by bone marrow cells.\n\n**Need for Transplantation**: Severe bone marrow diseases may require bone marrow transplants to restore normal function.

This appropriation allowed colonialists to view themselves as political successors - similar to how Romans saw themselves as heirs to Greek civilization.\n\nThe documents reveal a stark contrast in how colonialists viewed ancient versus modern populations. While ancient Egypt became \"patrimony of the West,\" modern Egyptians were portrayed by European archaeologists and tourists as \"uncivilized, savage, and the antithesis of the splendor of ancient Egypt.\"\n\nHowever, archaeology also became a tool of resistance. Colonized peoples used nationalist archaeology to resist colonialism and racism. Egyptian nationalists, for instance, utilized their ancient history to create \"Pharaonism\" as a response to Europe's \"Egyptomania,\" helping legitimize their independence movement.\n\nThis demonstrates how archaeological discoveries became both instruments of colonial oppression and tools for anti-colonial resistance.",

Their gods weren't depicted in human form until late in the Iron Age. Celtic shrines were located in remote areas like hilltops, groves, and lakes.\n\n**Historical Evidence:**\nInformation about the Celts comes from epigraphical evidence, toponymy (place names), and texts from the Roman period.

Wedding banquets (xǐ-jǐu) are extremely important, featuring 5-10 courses with symbolic ingredients like shark fin and abalone.

Some couples recite verses from Psalm 137:5 (\"If I forget thee O Jerusalem...\") at this moment.\n\n**The ritual**: After the bride receives the ring, the groom crushes a glass with his right foot, and guests shout \"mazel tov\" (congratulations). Sometimes a lightbulb is substituted because it breaks more easily and makes a louder sound.\n\nHowever, there's some controversy about how this is practiced. Former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef criticized people who treat it as pure celebration, arguing it should express sorrow over Jerusalem's destruction rather than \"lightheadedness.\"\n\nReform Judaism has adapted this custom so both bride and groom break the glass together.",

It unites with the East Branch at Medway to form the main Penobscot River.\n\nThe West Branch is renowned as a world-class landlocked salmon river and is home to various fish species including landlocked salmon and brook trout. It features many deep pools created by slate ledges, twelve miles of heavy rapids, deep runs, large pools, and some slower-moving sections. The Ripogenus Dam near Chesuncook Lake helps sustain the large landlocked salmon population.\n\nThe river offers excellent fishing opportunities from shore and by canoe, with some campsites available for extended stays. It also attracts whitewater rafters due to its class IV and V rapids. Historically, until 1971, it served as the main thoroughfare for the Great Northern Paper Company to transport logs to their Millinocket mill.",

The Erie Canal linked the Midwest to New York's port via the Hudson, making New York City \"one of the most vital ports in the nation.\" Multiple canals connected to it, including the Champlain, Oswego, and Delaware and Hudson canals.\n\n**Industrial Development**: During the Industrial Revolution, the Hudson became \"a major location for production\" with hundreds of factories built along it. It enabled fast transport of goods from the Northeast interior to the coast and connected to Great Lakes manufacturing.\n\nThe combination of these factors made the Hudson River \"one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation.\"",

He often styled his name as \"e e cummings,\" as he sometimes signed it.\n\n**Literary Output:**\nCummings wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. His first published work was \"The Enormous Room\" (an autobiographical novel), followed by his first poetry collection \"Tulips and Chimneys\" (1923), which introduced the public to his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\n**Personal Life:**\nIn 1926, his parents were in a car accident where only his mother survived, though she was severely injured. Cummings later described this accident in his \"i: six nonlectures\" series at Harvard (1952-1953).\n\n**Archives:**\nHis papers are preserved at Harvard University's Houghton Library and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.",

Cummings's personal experiences significantly influenced his poetry and artistic development:\n\n**Early Development:**\nCummings wanted to be a poet from childhood, writing poetry daily from age 8 to 22. He graduated from Harvard University in 1915 and received an advanced degree in 1916, where he developed an interest in modern poetry that ignored conventional grammar and syntax.\n\n**Artistic Influences:**\nHis work was influenced by notable modernists including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, as well as imagist experiments of Amy Lowell. Visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and surrealism, which he reflected in his work.\n\n**Personal Impact on Poetry:**\nHis father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, marking a new period in his artistic life. He began focusing on more important aspects of life in his poetry and paid homage to his father in the poem \"my father moved through dooms of love.\"\n\n**Artistic Evolution:**\nOver time, he shifted from using simile and metaphor to relying more on symbolism and allegory. His later poetry became \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound.\" He often incorporated imagery of nature and death into his work.",

Evidence shows that handheld roller gins were used in India since at least 500 CE, with the Ajanta caves yielding evidence of single-roller cotton gins by the 5th century. The Indian worm-gear roller gin was developed around the 13th-16th centuries.\n\nWhile India was the original birthplace, American inventor Eli Whitney created a modern mechanical version in 1793, which revolutionized cotton production in the United States.\n\nToday, cotton gins are used globally. The documents specifically mention that the Indian worm-gear roller gin \"has remained virtually unchanged up to the present time\" and \"is still used in the Indian subcontinent through to the present day.\" Modern automated cotton gins with multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws are now used worldwide, offering much higher productivity than earlier hand-powered versions.",

The documents note that photographers have \"full control over lighting, aircraft placement, camera angles, and background.\" Photos can capture \"aircraft exteriors, interiors, and aircraft details,\" and it's easier to include other subjects like pilots or additional aircraft. This type is described as one of the most popular forms along with ground-to-air photography.\n\n**Remote photography:** This is described as \"a variation on aerial air-to-air photography\" where the camera is mounted on the external structure of an aircraft away from the photographer and triggered remotely using mechanical or electrical controls. The image must be composed while the aircraft is on the ground since the photographer has no access to the camera during flight. This requires extensive planning and brainstorming to achieve the desired shot. The documents note that remote photography is \"the least common type of aviation photography.\"\n\nSo in total, the documents identify four types: air-to-air, ground-to-air, ground-static, and remote photography.",
