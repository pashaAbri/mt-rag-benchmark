When you reach the quota limit, the service is suspended for that month, but the quota resets on the first of every month.\n\nSo Lite plans themselves are standalone free offerings that don't require purchasing other products.",

As data is added to systems like Discovery, it's stored as JSON-formatted documents in an index, and queries help you search through this indexed data.\n\nThe specific definition depends on which system or context you're working with, but fundamentally, a query is a request to search for and retrieve specific information from a data source.",

Create a database within the service instance\n3. Populate the database with documents\n4. (Optional) Create an acurl alias for secure command-line access\n\n**Basic Query Process:**\n\n**1. Running Queries via Dashboard:**\n- Open your service instance and database\n- Go to the Query tab\n- Paste your query JSON into the Cloudant Query window\n- Click \"Run Query\" to see results\n\n**2. Query Syntax:**\nIBM Cloudant Query uses MongoDB-style syntax expressed in JSON form. Queries select document subsets using clauses that operate on data inside documents.\n\n**Example Query Structure:**\n```json\n{\n  \"$and\": [\n    {\"date\": {\"$gte\": 1900}},\n    {\"date\": {\"$lt\": 2000}}\n  ],\n  \"fields\": [\"title\"]\n}\n```\n\n**3. Creating Indexes (Recommended):**\nWithout indexes, Cloudant scans every document, which is inefficient for large datasets.\n\nTo create an index:\n- Select your database from the Dashboard\n- Go to Design Documents tab\n- Select \"New Indexes\"\n- Define your index:\n```json\n{\n  \"index\": {\n    \"fields\": [\"publisher\", \"year\"]\n  },\n  \"name\": \"publisher-year-index\",\n  \"type\": \"json\"\n}\n```\n\n**4. Query Methods:**\n- Dashboard interface (visual)\n- Programmatically via the `_find` endpoint\n- Command line using curl\n- Using the `db.find` function in applications\n\nThe query planner automatically selects the best available index for your query, making indexed queries much faster than full table scans.",

If you encounter persistent issues with CocoaPods, Carthage or source installation could be alternatives.\n\nHowever, if you're using IAM-based namespaces, you'll need to switch to the OpenWhisk REST API directly rather than using any mobile SDK installation method.",

Use Xcode menu: **Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax…** to choose a Swift version\n2. Configure directly in **Build Settings editor**\n3. Manually select the Pods project and IBM Cloud Functions target, go to Build Settings, and change \"Use Legacy Swift Language Version\" to **no**\n4. Add post-installation instructions to your Podfile to automatically set Swift version to 4.0\n\n**Namespace Compatibility:**\nThe mobile SDK is **not supported for IAM-based namespaces** - you must use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n**Workspace File Usage:**\nAfter installation, you must use the **.xcworkspace file** that CocoaPods creates (not the original .xcodeproj file) to open your project in Xcode.\n\nThese issues are generally resolvable through configuration changes, but the namespace limitation is a fundamental constraint.",

Source Code Installation:**\n- Download the source code directly from GitHub (https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-client-swift)\n- Open the project using OpenWhisk.xcodeproj with Xcode\n- The project contains two schemes: \"OpenWhisk\" (for iOS) and \"OpenWhiskWatch\" (for watchOS 2)\n\nBoth methods provide alternatives to CocoaPods for integrating the IBM Cloud Functions mobile SDK into your iOS/watchOS project. The Carthage method uses a dependency manager similar to CocoaPods, while the source code method gives you direct access to build and customize the SDK yourself.\n\nNote that regardless of installation method, the mobile SDK still requires a Cloud Foundry-based namespace (not IAM-based) and supports iOS 11+ with Swift 4.",

      "generated_response": "Based on the provided documents, here's how the Hive metastore client works with Apache Spark on IBM Analytics Engine Serverless:\n\n**What It Is:**\nThe Hive metastore client enables Apache Spark to connect to IBM Cloud Data Engine's catalog, which provides a **Hive metastore-compatible interface**. This creates a unified metadata repository for tables and views that can be shared across different Big Data engines.\n\n**Built-in Availability:**\nIBM Analytics Engine **already includes the compatible Hive metastore client**, so no additional downloads or installations are required for serverless instances.\n\n**Key Capabilities:**\n- **Read-only access** to existing tables and views from Data Engine catalog\n- Access to the **\"default\" database** exported by each Data Engine instance\n- **Metadata sharing** - table/view definitions created once can be used across multiple engines\n- **Seamless integration** with Spark SQL operations\n\n**Configuration:**\nYou need to provide:\n- **CRN** (Cloud Resource Name) of your Data Engine instance\n- **API key** with proper access permissions\n- **Region-specific endpoint** (us-south or eu-de)\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```python\n# Set credentials\ncrn='yourDataengineCRN'\napikey='yourAPIkey'\n\n# Connect using convenience library\nfrom dataengine import SparkSessionWithDataengine\nsession_builder = SparkSessionWithDataengine.enableDataengine(crn, apikey, \"public\")\nspark = session_builder.appName(\"Spark DataEngine integration\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Query tables\nspark.sql('show tables').show()\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **No infrastructure management** for metadata storage\n- **Consistent metadata** across different analytics tools\n- **Enterprise-grade security** through IBM Cloud IAM",

It's a two-way function that hides the original value but allows conversion back to the original state using keys.\n\n**Data Backup and Disaster Recovery** are operational processes focused on data availability and business continuity:\n\n- **Backup** involves creating copies of data stored separately (the documents show daily backups stored in separate data centers)\n- **Disaster Recovery** includes tasks like providing disaster recovery sites, failover capabilities, and restoring services after disasters\n\nHowever, they complement each other. The documents show that encryption is integrated into backup and disaster recovery processes:\n\n- \"All backups are encrypted\" (mentioned for Maximo Application Suite)\n- Communications between backup systems use \"secure transport\"\n- When copying backup snapshots across regions, encrypted snapshots require customer-managed keys\n\nSo while encryption protects data confidentiality, backup and disaster recovery ensure data availability and business continuity. Both are essential components of a comprehensive data protection strategy.",

Timing Issues:**\n- For keys with dual authorization, you must wait at least 4 hours after the second user authorizes deletion before you can purge the key\n- You need the KeyPurge attribute to complete the purge\n\n**3. Access Permissions:**\n- You may lack the required Manager access policy for the instance or key\n- You may not have the KeyPurge attribute needed for final deletion\n\n**4. Keys Still in Use:**\n- Keys that are actively being used by IBM Cloud services (like Cloud Databases) may have restrictions\n\n**5.
