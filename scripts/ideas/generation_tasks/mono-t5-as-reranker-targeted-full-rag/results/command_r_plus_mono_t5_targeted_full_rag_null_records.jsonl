Also, the cumulative size of all backups for a volume can't exceed 10 TB. \n Backup schedule Determine a backup schedule based on the type of volumes that you're backing up. For example, you might want to back up critical data that changes frequently more often than static data. \n Retention Determine a retention policy for backups in the backup plan. As subsequent backups are created, keep in mind that you incur costs for each backup that you retain. Deleting older backups keeps costs down. \n Backup plans Decide on the number of backup plans that you need for a policy. For example, you can have separate plans for daily backups, weekly, and monthly. \n Interface Choose the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform for creating and managing your backups. \n Billing Think about the number of backup snapshots that you want to take and other [billing considerations](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about&interface=apisnapshots_vpc_considerations) as the number of backup snapshots grows. \n Volume restore Evaluate when you might want to restore a volume from a backup.

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions. This is typically defined as a DR architecture.\n\nThe benefits of using a [DR orchestrator](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-cloud-resiliency-orchestrator) are covered in the context of a cloud environment and its fast changing behavior. You might require several integrations with management tools and services in IBM Cloud\u00ae.

We recommend that you verify possible changes or additional features that might apply to your environment.\n\n\n\n General disaster recovery strategy \n\nThe approach to defining your DR strategy needs to be systematic and start with the application or service, which is defined as a set of compute resources, for example Kubernetes apps, virtual machines, services, and more, that make up a business application.\n\nWhile a holistic approach might be wanted, the reality is that each business application (cloud service) is independent, with its own","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/overview?topic=overview-understanding-dr"},{"document_id":"ibmcld_08117-7-2019","score":0.9914073348,"text":"\nIBM Cloud Disaster Recovery (DR) and Backup and Restore \n\nLocal service interruption can be caused by many things: hardware failures, bugs, power failures, planned and unplanned maintenance.

Disaster recovery focuses on the IT components and restoring systems after a disaster.\n\n\n\n Disaster recovery components \n\nThe DR model has two main components that deal with what can be tolerated:\n\n\n\n* Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - the maximum time that the service can be down.\n* Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - the maximum amount of data loss.\n\n\n\nZoom\n\n![DR backup diagram.](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs-content\/v1\/content\/df269b100c3499f1efcbb7d030dce8dec25c539b\/ha-infrastructure\/images\/ha-DR-backup-diagram.svg)\n\nFigure 1. DR backup diagram\n\nThese values are directly correlated to both cost and complexity. A lower amount of time and data loss equates to higher cost and complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n DR Strategies \n\nYou can implement your DR strategy in one of two ways:\n\n\n\n Strategy Description Benefits \n\n Cold (Active\/Standby) With a Cold DR strategy, your solution is running in one environment and duplicate resources are available on standby. When an event occurs, you react and build up the standby site. A cold strategy is a reactive approach, where the upfront cost is minimal, other than storage costs for snapshots and backups. The cold approach typically entails higher RPO\/RTO times and is simple to implement.","title":"","source":"https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/ha-infrastructure?topic=ha-infrastructure-ha-dr-backup-restore"}],"input":[{"speaker":"user","text":"How can I delete a key?","metadata":{"author_type":"human","author_id":"fd309ff8-8b41-49a0-b483-2fee97472e71","created_at":1723455175}},{"speaker":"agent","text":"To delete a key using IBM Key Protect, you can follow these steps:\n1.

Plus any gains made by the price of the house. The main downside is you won't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out.  Also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair, you don't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time.

If you cannot get approval for the credit card you may need to get consolidation loan approval for your full $35K of debt. This approval again will depend on your income and your ability to make repayments. As it sounds like you don't have any assets, you may have to get an unsecured loan which comes with higher interest rates. Remember a consolidation loan is only worthwhile if you can get an interest rate lower than your current interest rates and if you pay as much as possible to reduce the term of the loan and the total interest you end up paying. You haven't given the interest rate for the consolidation loan, but lets assume you could get one at 12% p.a. over a 3 year period. For a loan of $18K you would have to pay $138 per week. Together with the $163.50 per week you would have to pay the credit card balance transfer, your total repayments per week for the first 2 years would be $301.50, then $138 per week for the 3rd year. This option sounds affordable, but without knowing what your income and current expenses are it is hard for others to determine for sure. If you had to get a consolidated loan for the full $35K at say 12% p.a. then your weekly repayments would be $268.30 over a 3 year period. This looks to be achievable too. Being Disciplined As you said you will need to be very disciplined in order to get out of this debt. You will need to set up a proper budget and watch every dollar you spend. You will need to restrict any spending on credit cards and getting any new personal loans. You say you will keep a small credit limit to pay for ongoing online payments for courses. Make sure you uses a 55 day interest free credit card (preferably with no annual fee) for this and pay the full amount due every month, so you don't end up paying any more interest on this card.

Recognizing your mistakes is a huge first step, and getting rid of your debt is a very worthwhile goal. When considering debt consolidation, there are really only two reasons to do so: Reason #1: To lower your monthly payment. If you are having trouble coming up with enough money to meet your monthly obligations, debt consolidation can lower your monthly payment by extending the time frame of the debt. The problem with this one is that it doesn't help you get out of debt faster. It actually makes it longer before you are out of debt and will increase the total amount of interest that you will pay to the banks before you are done. So I would not recommend debt consolidation for this reason unless you are truly struggling with your cashflow because your minimum monthly payments are too high. In your situation, it does not sound like you need to consolidate for this reason. Reason #2: To lower your interest rate. If your debt is at a very high rate, debt consolidation can lower your interest rate, which can reduce the time it will take to eliminate your debt. The consolidation loan you are considering is at a high interest rate on its own: 13.89%. Now, it is true that some of your debt is higher than that, but it looks like the majority of your debt is less than that rate. It doesn't sound to me that you will save a significant amount of money by consolidating in this loan. If you can obtain a better consolidation loan in the future, it might be worth considering. From your question, it looks like your reasoning for the consolidation loan is to close the credit card accounts as quickly as possible. I agree that you need to quit using the cards, but this can also be accomplished by destroying the cards. The consolidation loan is not needed for this. You also mentioned that you are considering adding $3,000 to your debt. I have to say that it doesn't make sense at all to me to add to your debt (especially at 13.89%) when your goal is to eliminate your debt.

Assets in joint accounts usually have their own instructions on how to disperse the assets; for example, full joint bank accounts usually immediately go to the other name on the account and never become part of the estate. Non-cash assets will likely need to be converted to cash and a fair market valuation shown to the probate court, unless the debts can be paid without using them and they can be transferred to next of kin. If, after that, the deceased has any assets at all, there is usually (varies by state) a legally defined order in which debtor types must be paid. This is handled by probating the estate. There is a period during which you publish a death notice and then wait for debt claims and bills to arrive. Then pay as many as possible based on the priority, and inform the others the holder is deceased and the estate is empty. This sometimes needs to be approved by a judge if the assets are less than the debts. Then disperse remaining assets to next of kin. If there are no assets held by just the deceased, as you get bills you just send a certified copy of the death certificate, tell them there is no estate, then forget about them. A lawyer can really help in determining which need to be paid and to work through probate, which is not simple or cheap.

Assets in joint accounts usually have their own instructions on how to disperse the assets; for example, full joint bank accounts usually immediately go to the other name on the account and never become part of the estate. Non-cash assets will likely need to be converted to cash and a fair market valuation shown to the probate court, unless the debts can be paid without using them and they can be transferred to next of kin. If, after that, the deceased has any assets at all, there is usually (varies by state) a legally defined order in which debtor types must be paid. This is handled by probating the estate. There is a period during which you publish a death notice and then wait for debt claims and bills to arrive. Then pay as many as possible based on the priority, and inform the others the holder is deceased and the estate is empty. This sometimes needs to be approved by a judge if the assets are less than the debts. Then disperse remaining assets to next of kin. If there are no assets held by just the deceased, as you get bills you just send a certified copy of the death certificate, tell them there is no estate, then forget about them. A lawyer can really help in determining which need to be paid and to work through probate, which is not simple or cheap.

My ex-wife declared bankruptcy and when debt collectors couldn't find her, they somehow tracked me down and told me that I should tell her that it would be to her advantage to pay off this debt before the bankruptcy went through. That was total nonsense of course. The whole point of bankruptcy is to not have to pay the debt. Why would you pay it just before it was wiped off the books? (Now that I think of it, I'm surprised that they didn't tell me that I should pay her debts.) As others have noted, this would be controlled by state law. But in general, when someone dies any debts are payed from the assets of the estate, and then whatever is left goes to the heirs. If nothing is left or the debts exceed the assets, then the heirs get nothing, but they don't have to pay somebody else's debts. I don't see how you could \"\"put the house under your name\"\".

Or as in this case, people could undermine the rights of creditors by transferring all assets to themselves before debts were paid. Even if there's some provision in your state for changing the name on a deed prior to probate to facilitate getting mortgages and taxes paid or whatever, I would be quite surprised if this allowed you to shelter assets from legitimate creditors. It would be a gaping loophole in inheritance law. Frankly, if your father's debts are more than the value of his assets, including the value of the house, I suspect you will not be able to keep the house. It will be sold to pay off the creditors.

Be especially wary of using your debit card when shopping online. If an identity thief gets hold of your debit card information, he or she can drain your bank account or open new accounts in your name. If you have a credit card, use it instead. Credit cards typically provide added protection against fraudulent charges.\nBe cautious when downloading mobile applications. Mobile apps often take more data from you than they need, either for their own use or to sell to third parties. To prevent your information from getting into the wrong hands, only download applications from official app stores and check other users\u2019 reviews, as well as the app\u2019s privacy policies, before downloading.\nUse a variety of passwords. If you use the same password for all your online activities, and an identity thief uncovers it, he or she could have access to your bank, email, and other personal accounts.

For digital records, consider the use of encrypted storage drives or password-protected files.\nShred sensitive documents. Tear, cut up, or shred sensitive materials, such as old records, files, bills, prescription labels, or expired credit cards before disposing of them. Once information leaves your hands, there is no way of knowing who may get their hands on it.\nSecure your wireless network.

Make sure your wireless network at home is protected with a strong password, the default administrator username has been changed, and turn on Wireless Network Encryption if available.\nLock your computer. If you are using a computer at your office or in a public place, make sure to lock it before you walk away to safeguard any personal information stored on the computer.\nProtect against viruses. Regularly update anti-virus protection software on your computer. In addition, keep your computer system and browser up to date and set at the highest security level.\nDouble-check mailings.

His summoning of the Synod of Arles and the First Council of Nicaea demonstrated his commitment to the unity of the Church and asserted his authority as its leader.The ascendancy of Christianity was briefly challenged when Emperor Julian came to power in 361 and sought to revive polytheism throughout the empire.

This weakening was further exacerbated by the partial institutions of Constantine, ultimately leading to the Roman world being overrun by Barbarians. Historians are still analyzing the reasons for the loss of political control over a vast territory and the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The AUC dating system was sometimes added in Renaissance manuscripts, giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years.

The plebs were demanding for definite , written , and secular laws . The patrician priests , who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes , by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change . After a long resistance to the new demands , the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers .

Constantine also established the principle that emperors could not unilaterally decide matters of religious doctrine, and instead, they should convene general ecclesiastical councils for that purpose. His summoning of the Synod of Arles and the First Council of Nicaea demonstrated his commitment to the unity of the Church and asserted his authority as its leader.The ascendancy of Christianity was briefly challenged when Emperor Julian came to power in 361 and sought to revive polytheism throughout the empire. He was later known as \"Julian the Apostate\" by the Church. However, Julian's efforts were reversed when he died in battle in 363.\nThe foundation of the Byzantine Empire was based on the belief that it was a reflection of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Just as God ruled in Heaven, the Emperor, created in His image, was expected to govern on Earth and uphold His commandments. The empire aspired to be universal and aimed to encompass all the peoples of the Earth. Ideally, all people would be members of the one true Christian Church, the Orthodox Church.","metadata":{"author_type":"model","author_id":"mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01","created_at":1723468667}},{"speaker":"user","text":"When was reorganized?","metadata":{"author_type":"human","author_id":"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c","created_at":1723469102}},{"speaker":"agent","text":"Constantine I reorganized the Roman Empire in the early 4th century, around 324-337 AD.

One theory suggests that the victorious legions, who acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries during distant wars, first oppressed the republic's freedom and later violated the majesty of the purple. Emperors, concerned for their personal safety and public peace, resorted to corrupting the military discipline, ultimately leading to the military government's weakening and dissolution. This weakening was further exacerbated by the partial institutions of Constantine, ultimately leading to the Roman world being overrun by Barbarians. Historians are still analyzing the reasons for the loss of political control over a vast territory and the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire. Alexander Demandt listed 210 theories on why Rome fell, and new ideas continue to emerge.

The AUC dating system was sometimes added in Renaissance manuscripts, giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years.

They also delete immediately any information about a child that they might inadvertently collect.
