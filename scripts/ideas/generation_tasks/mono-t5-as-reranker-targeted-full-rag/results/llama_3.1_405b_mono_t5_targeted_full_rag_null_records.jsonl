Read part 1 at: No Breathing Easy for City Dwellers: Nitrogen Dioxide.\n\nAir pollution is the fourth leading risk factor for death around the world. But one type of pollutant is particularly harmful: fine particulate matter (PM2.5). These small, inhalable particles (less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) result from direct emissions into the air, as well as interactions among other pollutants. PM2.5 is the leading cause of death among air pollutants, contributing to cardiovascular and respiratory disease and millions of premature deaths worldwide each year.\nIn a new study covering urban settlements worldwide, researchers found that PM2.5 concentrations and associated mortality declined in some areas due to reductions in precursor pollutants (such as oxides of sulfur and nitrogen) after the passage of clean air laws. However, the global average mortality rate attributable to PM2.5 remained relatively stable from 2000 to 2019.","title":"No Breathing Easy for City Dwellers: Particulates","source":"https:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/images\/149580\/no-breathing-easy-for-city-dwellers-particulates"},{"document_id":"6eeb0327b99b9a53-3044-5241","score":0.0000392635,"text":"No Breathing Easy for City Dwellers: Particulates\nThe map synthesizes measurements of aerosol optical depth acquired by NASA\u2019s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)\u2014satellite instruments flying since the late 1990s.\n\nThe graph above shows the global and regional urban averages of PM2.5-attributable mortality rates in different regions between 2000 and 2019. The dashed line shows the relatively steady global average rate.\n\u201cThere is a large range in the average PM2.5 concentration and associated health risk for urban areas in different world regions,\u201d Anenberg said. \u201cUrban PM2.5 and associated health impacts are improving in Europe and in the Americas, and worsening in South Asia. In the Western Pacific, which is the region that included China, urban air pollution and associated health impacts increased dramatically before declining more recently.\u201d\nIn some cities, even though the PM2.5 concentrations declined, the PM2.5-attributable mortality increased. This was due to aging populations and to disease rates shifting over time. \u201cYou have to think about not just the concentrations,\u201d Anenberg said, \u201cbut the vulnerability of the people who are breathing that air.\u201d\nIn 2019, about 86 percent of city dwellers worldwide (2.5 billion people) were found to live in areas where PM2.5 concentrations exceeded World Health Organization guidelines. Those levels of PM2.5 pollution resulted in an excess of 1.8 million deaths that year, the researchers found.\n\u201cNearly everyone in any city around the world is exposed to air that has harmful levels of air pollution in it,\u201d said Anenberg, a member of NASA\u2019s Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences team.\nFor areas with little to no ground-based pollution monitoring, the data from Anenberg and colleagues may be the first that local officials have regarding the impacts of air pollution in their cities. The team plans to continue working with local stakeholders and governments to help them interpret the data.\n\u201cEven cities with ground monitors can benefit from this information because the monitors can be sparsely located and may not cover the entire urban area,\u201d Anenberg said.","title":"No Breathing Easy for City Dwellers: Particulates","source":"https:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/images\/149580\/no-breathing-easy-for-city-dwellers-particulates"},{"document_id":"7330dbd2da2c3630-6264-8153","score":0.0000361087,"text":"Collection - Astronaut Photography\nSmog Layer Over Upstate New York\nThe STS-92 Space Shuttle astronauts photographed upstate New York at sunset on October 21, 2000.

This acceleration has been driven mainly by increased ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica, and it has the potential to double the total sea level rise projected by 2100, according to lead author Steve Nerem, a scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the University of Colorado.\nIf things continue to change at the observed pace, sea level will rise 65 centimeters (26 inches) by 2100, enough to cause significant problems for coastal cities.

First, warmer water expands, and this \u201cthermal expansion\u201d of the ocean has contributed about half of the 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) of global mean sea level rise that has been observed over the past 25 years, Nerem said. Second, the water from melting land ice flows into the ocean, which also increases sea level around the world.\nThe rate of sea level rise has risen from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year in the 1990s to about 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year today. These increases have been measured by satellite altimeters since 1992, including the TOPEX\/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 missions, which have been jointly managed by NASA, France\u2019s Centre national d'etudes spatiales (CNES), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Despite the amount of available scientific knowledge about the impacts of climate change happening now, and of new risks for the future, there is still a lack of understanding amongst the general public on the subject. Social scientists have been examining the attitudes that people have towards climate change. A 2017 Yale study found that 70 percent of the U.S. acknowledges that climate change is happening, with varying degrees of concern. But knowing that climate change is happening does not necessarily mean that people understand how human activities are contributing to GHG emissions and climate change, nor does it mean that people are able to easily adopt low-carbon lifestyles. Presenting climate change science clearly, in terms that the public can relate to, and informed by the insights of social and behavioral science, is an important focus and challenge for climate change communicators and educators.

Climate has changed when the planet received more or less sunlight due to subtle shifts in its orbit, as the atmosphere or surface changed, or when the Sun\u2019s energy varied. But in the past century, another force has started to influence Earth\u2019s climate: humanity.\n\n(NASA astronaut photograph ISS022-E-6674.)\n\nWhat is Global Warming?\nGlobal warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth\u2019s average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released by people burning fossil fuels.\nHow Does Today\u2019s Warming Compare to Past Climate Change?\nEarth has experienced climate change in the past without help from humanity. But the current climatic warming is occurring much more rapidly than past warming events.\nWhy Do Scientists Think Current Warming Isn\u2019t Natural?\nIn Earth\u2019s history before the Industrial Revolution, Earth\u2019s climate changed due to natural causes unrelated to human activity.","title":"Global Warming","source":"http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming"},{"document_id":"5306392549c81595-3041-5212","score":0.0204051603,"text":"Global Warming\nClimate has changed when the planet received more or less sunlight due to subtle shifts in its orbit, as the atmosphere or surface changed, or when the Sun\u2019s energy varied. But in the past century, another force has started to influence Earth\u2019s climate: humanity\nHow does this warming compare to previous changes in Earth\u2019s climate? How can we be certain that human-released greenhouse gases are causing the warming? How much more will the Earth warm? How will Earth respond? Answering these questions is perhaps the most significant scientific challenge of our time.\nWhat is Global Warming?\nGlobal warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth\u2019s average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released as people burn fossil fuels. The global average surface temperature rose 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.1 to 1.6\u00b0 F) between 1906 and 2005, and the rate of temperature increase has nearly doubled in the last 50 years. Temperatures are certain to go up further.\n\nDespite ups and downs from year to year, global average surface temperature is rising. By the beginning of the 21st century, Earth\u2019s temperature was roughly 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term (1951\u20131980) average. (NASA figure adapted from Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis.)\n\nEarth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect\nEarth\u2019s temperature begins with the Sun. Roughly 30 percent of incoming sunlight is reflected back into space by bright surfaces like clouds and ice. Of the remaining 70 percent, most is absorbed by the land and ocean, and the rest is absorbed by the atmosphere. The absorbed solar energy heats our planet.\nAs the rocks, the air, and the seas warm, they radiate \u201cheat\u201d energy (thermal infrared radiation). From the surface, this energy travels into the atmosphere where much of it is absorbed by water vapor and long-lived greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.\nWhen they absorb the energy radiating from Earth\u2019s surface, microscopic water or greenhouse gas molecules turn into tiny heaters\u2014 like the bricks in a fireplace, they radiate heat even after the fire goes out. They radiate in all directions.","title":"Global Warming","source":"http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming"},{"document_id":"28f6abec5bb810ba-6980-9294","score":0.0137846638,"text":"Climate Change - NYSDEC\nWhen the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable. This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The revolution of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis create variation in the intensity of solar radiation received by different sections of the planet and drive naturally occurring cycles of planetary cooling and warming. This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages. However, these natural climate cycles can be disrupted by conditions that cause an excessive amount of solar radiation to get trapped in the Earth's atmosphere and throw off the natural balance.Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20), that are naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere in small amounts and help form the atmospheric blanket at the ideal thickness. CO2 is vital for plants to carry out photosynthesis and produce oxygen for humans and animals to breathe. When excess GHGs are generated by human activities and accumulate in the atmosphere, they increase the thickness of the atmospheric blanket, trapping solar radiation in the Earth's atmosphere. GHGs absorb and transmit that radiation back to Earth as heat. The more GHGs accumulate in the atmosphere, the thicker the blanket becomes, trapping more heat inside and creating global warming.Global warming causes the Earth's land and oceans to absorb heat energy and warm more quickly than would happen naturally. Global warming is made worse by the melting of polar ice and glaciers. Because of the albedo effect, light-colored snow and ice act as mirrors to reflect solar radiation back out into space. As ice sheets and glaciers melt with increased global warming, reducing the amount of ice and snow covering, less of the solar radiation is reflected and more is absorbed into the darker ocean waters, creating a vicious cycle that warms the planet even more and melts even more polar ice and glaciers.Global warming has been rapidly accelerating in recent decades due to excess emissions of GHGs from human activities, especially burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.","title":"Climate Change - NYSDEC","source":"https:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/environmental-protection\/climate-change"}],"input":[{"speaker":"user","text":"\"What happens to people's bodies when there isn't enough atmospheric pressure?\"","metadata":{"author_type":"human","author_id":"fd309ff8-8b41-49a0-b483-2fee97472e71","created_at":1724755671}},{"speaker":"agent","text":" I do not have much information about this, but I can say that the atmospheric pressure in each layer of our atmosphere weighs down on the layer below it.

As ice sheets and glaciers melt with increased global warming, reducing the amount of ice and snow covering, less of the solar radiation is reflected and more is absorbed into the darker ocean waters, creating a vicious cycle that warms the planet even more and melts even more polar ice and glaciers.Global warming has been rapidly accelerating in recent decades due to excess emissions of GHGs from human activities, especially burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. While the term \"global warming\" refers to the long-term warming of the planet from excess GHG emissions, the term \"climate change\" refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to the earth, including sea level rise, shrinking glaciers, ocean acidification, desertification, more intense storm activities, and shifts in plant blooming times. Increased warming of the Earth's oceans and the atmosphere is driving climate change by affecting the way heat and moisture are moved through the climate system by air and ocean currents, changing patterns of precipitation, temperatures, storms, and even sea level all around the globe.Ocean WarmingOceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface and can absorb large amounts of solar energy. Heat and moisture are moved by ocean currents and atmospheric circulation, influencing the climate around the planet.The oceans have a large capacity for absorbing and holding heat. For decades, the oceans have taken up more than 90% of excess heat from the atmosphere. If not for the ability of Earth's oceans to absorb such large amounts of heat, the atmosphere would warm at a much faster rate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report (AR6) finds that the rate of ocean warming observed since 1971 will at least double by the year 2100, even if GHG emissions are reduced. Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth's climate system, particularly sea surface temperature (SST). SST has risen as oceans absorb more heat from the atmosphere, resulting in changes to ocean currents and circulation, as well as sea level rise. SST has a significant impact on climate. As SST rises, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor over the oceans, influencing weather systems that produce precipitation or contribute to drought conditions.","title":"Climate Change - NYSDEC","source":"https:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/environmental-protection\/climate-change"},{"document_id":"5306392549c81595-26161-28651","score":0.0013601079,"text":"Global Warming\nThe impact of climate change on the land carbon cycle is extremely complex, but on balance, land carbon sinks will become less efficient as plants reach saturation, where they can no longer take up additional carbon dioxide, and other limitations on growth occur, and as land starts to add more carbon to the atmosphere from warming soil, fires, and insect infestations. This will result in a faster increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and more rapid global warming. In some climate models, carbon cycle feedbacks from both land and ocean add more than a degree Celsius to global temperatures by 2100.\nEmission Scenarios\nScientists predict the range of likely temperature increase by running many possible future scenarios through climate models. Although some of the uncertainty in climate forecasts comes from imperfect knowledge of climate feedbacks, the most significant source of uncertainty in these predictions is that scientists don\u2019t know what choices people will make to control greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe higher estimates are made on the assumption that the entire world will continue using more and more fossil fuel per capita, a scenario scientists call \u201cbusiness-as-usual.\u201d More modest estimates come from scenarios in which environmentally friendly technologies such as fuel cells, solar panels, and wind energy replace much of today\u2019s fossil fuel combustion.\nIt takes decades to centuries for Earth to fully react to increases in greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide, among other greenhouse gases, will remain in the atmosphere long after emissions are reduced, contributing to continuing warming. In addition, as Earth has warmed, much of the excess energy has gone into heating the upper layers of the ocean. Like a hot water bottle on a cold night, the heated ocean will continue warming the lower atmosphere well after greenhouse gases have stopped increasing.\nThese considerations mean that people won\u2019t immediately see the impact of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Even if greenhouse gas concentrations stabilized today, the planet would continue to warm by about 0.6\u00b0C over the next century because of greenhouses gases already in the atmosphere.\nSee Earth\u2019s Big Heat Bucket, Correcting Ocean Cooling, and Climate Q&A: If we immediately stopped emitting greenhouse gases, would global warming stop? to learn more about the ocean heat and global warming.\n\nHow Will Global Warming Change Earth?\nThe impact of increased surface temperatures is significant in itself.","title":"Global Warming","source":"http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming"},{"document_id":"65dbe69d820fb9b5-2608-4774","score":0.0005115889,"text":"Bill Text - AB-32 Air pollution: greenhouse gases: California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.\nThe bill would require the state board to monitor compliance with and enforce any rule, regulation, order, emission limitation, emissions reduction measure, or market-based compliance mechanism adopted by the state board, pursuant to specified provisions of existing law.

Given the large changes we are seeing in the ice sheets today, that is not likely.\u201d\nRising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which causes sea level to rise in two ways. First, warmer water expands, and this \u201cthermal expansion\u201d of the ocean has contributed about half of the 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) of global mean sea level rise that has been observed over the past 25 years, Nerem said. Second, the water from melting land ice flows into the ocean, which also increases sea level around the world.\nThe rate of sea level rise has risen from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year in the 1990s to about 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year today. These increases have been measured by satellite altimeters since 1992, including the TOPEX\/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 missions, which have been jointly managed by NASA, France\u2019s Centre national d'etudes spatiales (CNES), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

In fact, the climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region. Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Said that global temperatures are rising and this is a global warming in face of the  higher sea levels and more intense storms, coastal communities facing greater risk of rapid beach erosion from destructive storms. Hotter summers and more frequent fires will lead to more cases of heat stroke and deaths, and to higher levels of near-surface ozone and smoke, which would cause more \u2018code red\u2019 air quality days. Intense droughts can lead to an increase in malnutrition. On a longer time scale, fresh water will become scarcer, especially during the summer, as mountain glaciers disappear, particularly in Asia and parts of North America.  All that scientists predicted, such as the loss of sea ice, melting glaciers and ice sheets, sea level rise, and more intense heat waves. It is true that despite the amount of available scientific knowledge about the impacts of climate change happening now, and of new risks for the future, there is still a lack of understanding amongst the general public. But indeed, global warming with some exceptions is real, the tropics will likely receive less rain as the planet warms, while the polar regions will receive more precipitation.

The first is hazard mitigation \u2013 over a half a billion people live directly in harms way of typical volcanic activity. This number grows significantly when one considers the much larger (but more rare) eruptions that have happened over time. The second reason is that volcanism is a primary geologic process that has operated throughout most of the Earth\u2019s history (along with impact cratering). For a geologist, studying volcanoes can lead to important insights into the solid Earth processes that have operated over geologic time and are ongoing at depth under every active volcano.\nWhat are some effects of volcanic eruptions on the global climate?\nMR: I do not study the climate aspects of volcanic eruptions directly since I am more interested in the geology. However volcanoes can produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, water, and sulfur dioxide as well as ash.\u00a0 The first two are major greenhouse gases, which can impact climate change. Volcanic ash can cause major disruptions to air traffic (as was seen in Iceland in 2010), can render lands around the volcano unusable for decades, be a major irritant to human health, and can cause structures to fail due to the weight of the ash.\nVolcano eruptions disperse gas, liquids, and particles into the lower atmosphere.\u00a0 One of the expellants is sulfur dioxide (SO2.)\u00a0 What are the effects on the environment?","title":"April | 2012 | Terra","source":"https:\/\/terra.nasa.gov\/2012\/04"},{"document_id":"5306392549c81595-9843-12403","score":0.910545826,"text":"Global Warming\nVolcanic activity has also, in the deep past, increased greenhouse gases over millions of years, contributing to episodes of global warming.\nA biographical sketch of Milutin Milankovitch describes how changes in Earth\u2019s orbit affects its climate.\nThese natural causes are still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades.

For example, two major volcanic eruptions, El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991, pumped sulfur dioxide gas high into the atmosphere. The gas was converted into tiny particles that lingered for more than a year, reflecting sunlight and shading Earth\u2019s surface. Temperatures across the globe dipped for two to three years.\n\nAlthough Earth\u2019s temperature fluctuates naturally, human influence on climate has eclipsed the magnitude of natural temperature changes over the past 120 years. Natural influences on temperature\u2014El Ni\u00f1o, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols\u2014have varied approximately plus and minus 0.2\u00b0 C (0.4\u00b0 F), (averaging to about zero), while human influences have contributed roughly 0.8\u00b0 C (1\u00b0 F) of warming since 1889. (Graphs adapted from Lean et al., 2008.)\n\nAlthough volcanoes are active around the world, and continue to emit carbon dioxide as they did in the past, the amount of carbon dioxide they release is extremely small compared to human emissions. On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By burning fossil fuels, people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005). As a result, human activity overshadows any contribution volcanoes may have made to recent global warming.\nChanges in the brightness of the Sun can influence the climate from decade to decade, but an increase in solar output falls short as an explanation for recent warming. NASA satellites have been measuring the Sun\u2019s output since 1978. The total energy the Sun radiates varies over an 11-year cycle. During solar maxima, solar energy is approximately 0.1 percent higher on average than it is during solar minima.\n\nThe transparent halo known as the solar corona changes between solar maximum (left) and solar minimum (right). (NASA Extreme Ultraviolet Telescope images from the SOHO Data Archive.)\n\nEach cycle exhibits subtle differences in intensity and duration.","title":"Global Warming","source":"http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming"},{"document_id":"2f87b14ee2962dfa-11117-13317","score":0.802113533,"text":"Aerosols: Tiny Particles, Big Impact\nDust impacts radiation to varying degrees, depending on the composition of the minerals that comprise the dust grains, and whether they are coated with black or brown carbon. Salt particles tend to reflect all the sunlight they encounter.\n\nBlack carbon aerosols, similar to the soot in a chimney, absorb sunlight rather than reflecting it. This warms the layer of the atmosphere carrying the black carbon, but also shades and cools the surface below. (Maps adapted from Chung, 2005.)\n\nAerosols can have a major impact on climate when they scatter light. In 1991, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines ejected more than 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide\u2014a gas that reacts with other substances to produce sulfate aerosol\u2014as high as 60 kilometers (37 miles) above the surface, creating particles in the stratosphere. Those bright particles remained above the clouds and didn\u2019t get washed from the sky by rain; they settled only after several years.\nClimatologists predicted global temperatures would drop as a result of that global sulfate infusion. They were right: Following the eruption, global temperatures abruptly dipped by about a half-degree (0.6\u00b0C) for about two years. And Pinatubo isn\u2019t a unique event. Large, temperature-altering eruptions occur about once per decade.\n\nLarge volcanic eruptions may lift sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, which usually cools the global climate for the following year or two. (Graph by Robert Simmon, based on aerosol data from GISS and temperature data from the UAE CRU.)\n\nIn addition to scattering or absorbing radiation, aerosols can alter the reflectivity, or albedo, of the planet. Bright surfaces reflect radiation and cool the climate, whereas darker surfaces absorb radiation and produce a warming effect. White sheets of sea ice, for example, reflect a great deal of radiation, whereas darker surfaces, such as the ocean, tend to absorb solar radiation and have a net warming effect.\nAerosols, particularly black carbon, can alter reflectivity by depositing a layer of dark residue on ice and other bright surfaces. In the Arctic especially, aerosols from wildfires and industrial pollution are likely hastening the melting of ice.","title":"Aerosols: Tiny Particles, Big Impact","source":"http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/Aerosols\/"},{"document_id":"5306392549c81595-8119-10402","score":0.6382648349,"text":"Global Warming\nThe paleoclimate record combined with global models shows past ice ages as well as periods even warmer than today. But the paleoclimate record also reveals that the current climatic warming is occurring much more rapidly than past warming events.\nAs the Earth moved out of ice ages over the past million years, the global temperature rose a total of 4 to 7 degrees Celsius over about 5,000 years. In the past century alone, the temperature has climbed 0.7 degrees Celsius, roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.\n\nTemperature histories from paleoclimate data (green line) compared to the history based on modern instruments (blue line) suggest that global temperature is warmer now than it has been in the past 1,000 years, and possibly longer. (Graph adapted from Mann et al., 2008.)\n\nModels predict that Earth will warm between 2 and 6 degrees Celsius in the next century. When global warming has happened at various times in the past two million years, it has taken the planet about 5,000 years to warm 5 degrees. The predicted rate of warming for the next century is at least 20 times faster. This rate of change is extremely unusual.\n\nIs Current Warming Natural?\nIn Earth\u2019s history before the Industrial Revolution, Earth\u2019s climate changed due to natural causes not related to human activity. Most often, global climate has changed because of variations in sunlight. Tiny wobbles in Earth\u2019s orbit altered when and where sunlight falls on Earth\u2019s surface. Variations in the Sun itself have alternately increased and decreased the amount of solar energy reaching Earth. Volcanic eruptions have generated particles that reflect sunlight, brightening the planet and cooling the climate. Volcanic activity has also, in the deep past, increased greenhouse gases over millions of years, contributing to episodes of global warming.\nA biographical sketch of Milutin Milankovitch describes how changes in Earth\u2019s orbit affects its climate.\nThese natural causes are still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades. We know this because scientists closely monitor the natural and human activities that influence climate with a fleet of satellites and surface instruments.","title":"Global Warming","source":"http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming"}],"input":[{"speaker":"user","text":"\"What happens to people's bodies when there isn't enough atmospheric pressure?\"","metadata":{"author_type":"human","author_id":"fd309ff8-8b41-49a0-b483-2fee97472e71","created_at":1724755671}},{"speaker":"agent","text":" I do not have much information about this, but I can say that the atmospheric pressure in each layer of our atmosphere weighs down on the layer below it.

It is often necessary for professional archeologists to work closely with other professionals on specific \r\n\tprojects. While archeological work can at times be highly technical, there are many opportunities to learn about archeology without \r\n\tin-depth technical training. Various colleges, universities, and schools in New York State offer programs in archeology and closely \r\n\trelated fields. Learning about archeology increases our appreciation of the value of these cultural and historic resources and \r\n\tstrengthens our sense of responsibility for protecting them.

American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly progress called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands , with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded . In contrast to Hitler , Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations , though he approved strategic decisions . Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan , but he always insisted on Germany first . The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf , and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific .

In return for the Soviet Union 's entrance into the war against Japan , the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island . The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations , and they also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council , which would be charged with ensuring international peace and security . Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland , but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe , which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany . Germany itself would not be dismembered , but would be jointly occupied by the United States , France , Britain , and the Soviet Union . Against Soviet pressure , Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war . Roosevelt 's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial ; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe , while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war .

With the war in Europe occupying the attention of the major colonial powers , Japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the Dutch East Indies , French Indochina , and British Malaya . After Roosevelt announced a $100 million loan to China in reaction to Japan 's occupation of northern French Indochina , Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy .

Overcoming those who favored invading the Soviet Union , the Japanese Army high command successfully advocated for the conquest of Southeast Asia to ensure continued access to raw materials . In July 1941 , after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina , Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan , depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply .

They suggest that Roosevelt's concessions at Yalta emboldened Stalin to pursue further territorial gains, including the seizure of the two northern islands.\n\nIt is worth noting that Roosevelt died in April 1945, just a few months after the Yalta Conference, and it was his successor, Harry Truman, who had to deal with the consequences of the Soviet Union's actions in the final stages"}],"prompt_id":"baseline","Standalone Type":null,"Validity":null,"Ambiguity Type":null,"metrics":{"Recall":[0.4677419355],"RougeL_stemFalse":[0.2083333333],"BertscoreP":[0.1245448142],"BertscoreR":[0.3362410963],"BertKPrec":[0.0432515293,0.2275681198,0.0512585975,0.0889701918,-0.0094073238],"Extractiveness_RougeL":[0.2011173184,0.2093023256,0.1662337662,0.1761904762,0.1761006289],"Length":[1051],"RB_agg":[0.378502407],"RB_agg_zero_denominator":[false],"RL_F":[0.8333333333],"idk_eval":[0.0],"RB_llm":[0.8]},"_original_idx":826}

This mismatch can limit the ability of both pollinators and plants to survive and reproduce, which would reduce food availability throughout the food chain.\nSee Buzzing About Climate Change to read more about how the lifecycle of bees is synched with flowering plants.\nWarmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing throughout the season or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires. Once the growing season ends, shorter, milder winters fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons.\nIn some ecosystems, maximum daily temperatures might climb beyond the tolerance of indigenous plant or animal. To survive the extreme temperatures, both marine and land-based plants and animals have started to migrate towards the poles. Those species, and in some cases, entire ecosystems, that cannot quickly migrate or adapt, face extinction. The IPCC estimates that 20-30 percent of plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction if temperatures climb more than 1.5\u00b0 to 2.5\u00b0C.\nImpacting People\nThe changes to weather and ecosystems will also affect people more directly. Hardest hit will be those living in low-lying coastal areas, and residents of poorer countries who do not have the resources to adapt to changes in temperature extremes and water resources. As tropical temperature zones expand, the reach of some infectious diseases, such as malaria, will change. More intense rains and hurricanes and rising sea levels will lead to more severe flooding and potential loss of property and life.\n\nOne inevitable consequence of global warming is sea-level rise. In the face of higher sea levels and more intense storms, coastal communities face greater risk of rapid beach erosion from destructive storms like the intense nor\u2019easter of April 2007 that caused this damage. (Photograph \u00a92007 metimbers2000.)\n\nHotter summers and more frequent fires will lead to more cases of heat stroke and deaths, and to higher levels of near-surface ozone and smoke, which would cause more \u2018code red\u2019 air quality days. Intense droughts can lead to an increase in malnutrition.","title":"Global Warming","source":"http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming"},{"document_id":"838fffa336b64b99-1289-2846","score":0.0040797326,"text":"West Nile Virus | Sierra County, CA - Official Website\nWhat are the risks?In 2015, 44 states and the District of Columbia in the continental United States have reported 2,175 cases of West Nile virus in people.

Intense droughts can lead to an increase in malnutrition. On a longer time scale, fresh water will become scarcer, especially during the summer, as mountain glaciers disappear, particularly in Asia and parts of North America.\nOn the flip side, there could be \u201cwinners\u201d in a few places. For example, as long as the rise in global average temperature stays below 3 degrees Celsius, some models predict that global food production could increase because of the longer growing season at mid- to high-latitudes, provided adequate water resources are available. The same small change in temperature, however, would reduce food production at lower latitudes, where many countries already face food shortages. On balance, most research suggests that the negative impacts of a changing climate far outweigh the positive impacts. Current civilization\u2014agriculture and population distribution\u2014has developed based on the current climate. The more the climate changes, and the more rapidly it changes, the greater the cost of adaptation.\nUltimately, global warming will impact life on Earth in many ways, but the extent of the change is largely up to us. Scientists have shown that human emissions of greenhouse gases are pushing global temperatures up, and many aspects of climate are responding to the warming in the way that scientists predicted they would. This offers hope. Since people are causing global warming, people can mitigate global warming, if they act in time. Greenhouse gases are long-lived, so the planet will continue to warm and changes will continue to happen far into the future, but the degree to which global warming changes life on Earth depends on our decisions now.\n\nReferences\nAnthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., MacCracken, M.C., & Trenberth, K.

Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces.

A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat.

The surveillance portion of that has been implemented and the task force is working to finalize the management plan.\n\nCan chronic wasting disease be spread to humans?\n\nThere are no documented cases of CWD affecting a human. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that hunters do not eat meat from deer that test positive for CWD or otherwise appear sick. In addition, CDFW recommends that hunters wear latex or nitrile gloves when field-dressing and processing animals, and that hunters wash their hands and disinfect tools after processing.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease diagnosed?\n\nCurrently, the only approved tests for CWD require lymph node or brainstem samples, taken after death, to detect the prion associated with CWD.

It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?","title":"\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n","source":"https:\/\/wildlife.ca.gov\/Conservation\/Laboratories\/Wildlife-Investigations\/Monitoring\/CWD"},{"document_id":"dd2c94212064f84d-1565-3429","score":0.0010989561,"text":"\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nCDFW Sampling Station or Office\n\t\n\n \n\nMeat Processor or Taxidermist\n\t\n\n \n\nHunter-generated samples sent to CDFW\n\t\n\nStep 2.

It is caused by a misfolded form of a normal protein, known as a prion. The misfolded proteins aggregate in tissues, particularly the brain, causing progressive damage. CWD belongs to a group of human and animal diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Examples of TSEs in animals include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, also known as \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d and scrapie in sheep and goats, which has been known to veterinary medicine for over 200 years. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a sporadic prion disease arising in 1:1,000,000 people, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has been linked to the consumption of infected cattle during the \u201cmad cow disease\u201d outbreak in Great Britain and Europe in the 1990s, are examples of TSEs in humans.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease spread?\n\nThe misfolded prion that causes CWD is infectious to other cervids and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals or through contact with a contaminated environment.","title":"\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n","source":"https:\/\/wildlife.ca.gov\/Conservation\/Laboratories\/Wildlife-Investigations\/Monitoring\/CWD"},{"document_id":"2f56e1fa866931c5-46471-47650","score":0.0000265208,"text":"Post-COVID Conditions: Information for Healthcare Providers\nLopez-Leon S, Wegman-Ostrosky T, Perelman C, et al.

It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?","title":"\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n","source":"https:\/\/wildlife.ca.gov\/Conservation\/Laboratories\/Wildlife-Investigations\/Monitoring\/CWD"},{"document_id":"00e9adb15f35b625-3085-4945","score":0.0085403975,"text":"COVID-19 Overview and Infection Prevention and Control Priorities in non-U.S. Healthcare Settings | CDC\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals or humans.

COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market; however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases occurred.\nTransmission\nThere are three main ways that COVID-19 can spread:\n\nBy breathing in air carrying droplets or aerosol particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus when close to an infected person or in poorly ventilated spaces with infected persons\nBy having droplets and particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth \u2013 especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze\nBy touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles on them\n\nThe droplets that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons.","title":"COVID-19 Overview and Infection Prevention and Control Priorities in non-U.S. Healthcare Settings | CDC","source":"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/non-us-settings\/overview\/index.html"},{"document_id":"dd2c94212064f84d-1565-3429","score":0.0005565162,"text":"\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nCDFW Sampling Station or Office\n\t\n\n \n\nMeat Processor or Taxidermist\n\t\n\n \n\nHunter-generated samples sent to CDFW\n\t\n\nStep 2.

It is caused by a misfolded form of a normal protein, known as a prion. The misfolded proteins aggregate in tissues, particularly the brain, causing progressive damage. CWD belongs to a group of human and animal diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Examples of TSEs in animals include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, also known as \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d and scrapie in sheep and goats, which has been known to veterinary medicine for over 200 years. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a sporadic prion disease arising in 1:1,000,000 people, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has been linked to the consumption of infected cattle during the \u201cmad cow disease\u201d outbreak in Great Britain and Europe in the 1990s, are examples of TSEs in humans.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease spread?\n\nThe misfolded prion that causes CWD is infectious to other cervids and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals or through contact with a contaminated environment.","title":"\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n","source":"https:\/\/wildlife.ca.gov\/Conservation\/Laboratories\/Wildlife-Investigations\/Monitoring\/CWD"},{"document_id":"e5778b06c4f6a3c7-2-2115","score":0.0002504096,"text":"Plague\nPlague\n\nskip to main content\n\n\r\n Your browser does not support iFrames\r\n \n\nNavigation menu\n\nDepartment of Health\n\nIndividuals\/Families\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine\nBirth, Death, Marriage & Divorce Records\nHealth Insurance Programs\nConsumer Health Care Information\nCommunity Health\nHealthy Lifestyles\nHealth & Safety in the Home, Workplace & Outdoors\nDiseases & Conditions\nData & Reports\nHealth Topics A to Z\n\nProviders\/Professionals\n\nNovel Coronavirus\nNarcotic Enforcement\nEMS\nHealth Initiatives\nData & Reports\nDiseases & Conditions\nPatient Resources\nDisease Reporting\nClinical Guidelines, Standards & Quality of Care\nPermits, Licenses & Certification\nAll Health Care Professionals & Patient Safety\nHealth Topics A to Z\n\nHealth Facilities\n\nCompare Health Care Providers\nAdult Care Facilities\/Assisted Living\nHome Care & Hospice\nHospitals & Clinics\nNew York State Veterans Homes\nNursing Homes\nSchool Based Health Centers\nAll Health Care Facilities\nHealth Topics A to Z\n\nHealth Data\n\nOpen Health Data\nNYS Health Connector\nData & Reports\n\nAbout Us\n\nAbout the Department\nRelated Sites\nHealth Topics A to Z\n\nSearch\n\nYou are Here: Home Page\n>\n Communicable Diseases A-Z\n> Plague\n\nPlague\nReviewed: December 2016 \nPlague is a severe disease that affects humans and other mammals and is caused by an infection with a type of bacteria, Yersinia pestis.

This mismatch can limit the ability of both pollinators and plants to survive and reproduce, which would reduce food availability throughout the food chain.\nSee Buzzing About Climate Change to read more about how the lifecycle of bees is synched with flowering plants.\nWarmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing throughout the season or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires. Once the growing season ends, shorter, milder winters fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons.\nIn some ecosystems, maximum daily temperatures might climb beyond the tolerance of indigenous plant or animal. To survive the extreme temperatures, both marine and land-based plants and animals have started to migrate towards the poles. Those species, and in some cases, entire ecosystems, that cannot quickly migrate or adapt, face extinction. The IPCC estimates that 20-30 percent of plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction if temperatures climb more than 1.5\u00b0 to 2.5\u00b0C.\nImpacting People\nThe changes to weather and ecosystems will also affect people more directly. Hardest hit will be those living in low-lying coastal areas, and residents of poorer countries who do not have the resources to adapt to changes in temperature extremes and water resources. As tropical temperature zones expand, the reach of some infectious diseases, such as malaria, will change. More intense rains and hurricanes and rising sea levels will lead to more severe flooding and potential loss of property and life.\n\nOne inevitable consequence of global warming is sea-level rise. In the face of higher sea levels and more intense storms, coastal communities face greater risk of rapid beach erosion from destructive storms like the intense nor\u2019easter of April 2007 that caused this damage.

The oceans play a crucial role in absorbing heat, but also in regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The oceans have taken up almost 30% of total atmospheric CO2 emissions since 1980. CO2 reacts with ocean water to produce carbonic acid, which increases the acidity (lowers the pH) of ocean water. The more atmospheric CO2 levels rise, the more intensely ocean acidification will occur.While the ocean's ability to absorb CO2 helps to reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere, ocean acidification is impacting marine life and ecosystems, especially corals, plankton, shellfish, and other marine organisms with shells and skeletons composed of a mineral called calcium carbonate. Acidic water dissolves calcium carbonate, preventing these organisms from thriving and contributing to larger-scale impacts on ecosystems that rely on these organisms for survival.Human Influence on Climate Change\n\n \n\nWhere do excess GHGs in the atmosphere come from? Over the last century, human activity has been and still is the largest source of GHG emissions in the atmosphere.GHGs are released into the atmosphere largely through burning fossil fuels. CO2 is the most abundant GHG present in the atmosphere because fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas are composed mainly of carbon. When these fuels are burned to produce electricity, for heating, or in vehicles with internal combustion engines, carbon is released into the atmosphere. That carbon combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to form CO2. GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N20 are also emitted as a result of other human activities such as farming, mining, manufacturing, certain industrial processes, and even the decomposition of organic waste in landfills.Forests, wetlands, peatlands, and similar ecosystems are known as carbon \"sinks\" because they naturally absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere in a process called carbon sequestration and storage.","title":"Climate Change - NYSDEC","source":"https:\/\/www.dec.ny.gov\/environmental-protection\/climate-change"},{"document_id":"5306392549c81595-34864-37107","score":0.0002515525,"text":"Global Warming\nIn the face of higher sea levels and more intense storms, coastal communities face greater risk of rapid beach erosion from destructive storms like the intense nor\u2019easter of April 2007 that caused this damage.

Intense droughts can lead to an increase in malnutrition. On a longer time scale, fresh water will become scarcer, especially during the summer, as mountain glaciers disappear, particularly in Asia and parts of North America.\nOn the flip side, there could be \u201cwinners\u201d in a few places. For example, as long as the rise in global average temperature stays below 3 degrees Celsius, some models predict that global food production could increase because of the longer growing season at mid- to high-latitudes, provided adequate water resources are available. The same small change in temperature, however, would reduce food production at lower latitudes, where many countries already face food shortages. On balance, most research suggests that the negative impacts of a changing climate far outweigh the positive impacts. Current civilization\u2014agriculture and population distribution\u2014has developed based on the current climate. The more the climate changes, and the more rapidly it changes, the greater the cost of adaptation.\nUltimately, global warming will impact life on Earth in many ways, but the extent of the change is largely up to us. Scientists have shown that human emissions of greenhouse gases are pushing global temperatures up, and many aspects of climate are responding to the warming in the way that scientists predicted they would. This offers hope. Since people are causing global warming, people can mitigate global warming, if they act in time. Greenhouse gases are long-lived, so the planet will continue to warm and changes will continue to happen far into the future, but the degree to which global warming changes life on Earth depends on our decisions now.\n\nReferences\nAnthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., MacCracken, M.C., & Trenberth, K.
