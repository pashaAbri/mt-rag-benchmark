While generally fewer wildfires occur in the fall (as compared to summer), these fires\u00a0can be particularly severe because forests are dry after little to no rainfall during the summer, as well as due to other autumn weather conditions such as high winds. \n\nIncrease in Wildfires Has Led to Concerns About State\u2019s Preparedness and Demands on Firefighters.

Responding to these large and severe wildfires has imposed significant burdens on firefighters\u2014many of whom have been required to work long stretches without breaks. This, in turn, has led to concerns about the mental and physical health and wellness of the firefighters who are on the\u00a0frontlines of these events.

California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\" as the area burned exceeded 1 million acres. The fire crossed seven counties and has been described as being larger than the state of Rhode Island. On August 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16\u201317. In early September 2020, a combination of a record-breaking heat wave, and Diablo and Santa Ana winds sparked more fires and explosively grew the active fires, with the August Complex more than doubling the Mendocino Complex's size to become California's largest recorded wildfire.\n\nPictured: The LNU Lightning Complex which burned across wine country in August 2020.\n\nincidents by year\n\nACTIVE\u00a0\n2023\u00a0\n2022\u00a0\n2021\u00a0\n2019\u00a0\n2018\u00a0\n2017\u00a0\n2016\u00a0\n\nQuick Links\n\nCurrent Incidents\n\n2024 Incidents\n\nDefensible Space\n\nExecutive Staff\n\nResources\n\nStatistics\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter\n\n2024 Strategic Plan\n\nPrograms\n\nBoard of Forestry and Fire Protection\n\nCommunications\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\n\nFire and Resource Assessment Program\n\nFire Protection\n\nNatural Resource Management\n\nOffice of the State Fire Marshal\n\nProfessional Standards Program\n\nGrants\n\nBusiness and Workforce Development\n\nCalifornia Forest Improvement Program\n\nForest Health\n\nForest Legacy\n\nUrban and Community Forestry\n\nWildfire Prevention\n\nTribal Wildfire Resilience\n\nWildfire Resilience\n\nBack to Top\nAccessibility\nLanguage Access\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nSite Map\nGlossary of Terms\n\n\r\n Copyright \u00a9 2024 State of California\r\n \n\nBack to top", "title": "2020 Fire Season Incident Archive | CAL FIRE", "source": "https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020"}, {"document_id": "031693dc1490c39e-4593-6990", "score": 0.828424155712127, "text": "Wildfires - NYSDEC\nWildfires, often called forest fires, damage thousands of acres of natural resources most every year in New York. Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands.

Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states.\nHowever, all floods are not alike. Some floods develop slowly, sometimes over a period of days. But flash floods can develop quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain. Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water that carries rocks, mud, and other debris and can sweep away most things in its path. Overland flooding occurs outside a defined river or stream, such as when a levee is breached, but still can be destructive. Flooding can also occur when a dam breaks, producing effects similar to flash floods.\nBe aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can flood.

Your residence may be built \u201cto code,\u201d but that does not mean it can withstand winds from extreme events such as tornadoes and major hurricanes. The purpose of a safe room or a wind shelter is to provide a space where you and your family can seek refuge that provides a high level of protection. You can build a safe room in one of several places in your home.\n\nYour basement.\nAtop a concrete slab-on-grade foundation or garage floor.\nAn interior room on the first floor.\n\nSafe rooms built below ground level provide the greatest protection, but a safe room built in a first-floor interior room also can provide the necessary protection. Below-ground safe rooms must be designed to avoid accumulating water during the heavy rains that often accompany severe windstorms.\nTo protect its occupants, a safe room must be built to withstand high winds and flying debris, even if the rest of the residence is severely damaged or destroyed. Consider the following when building a safe room:\n\nThe safe room must be adequately anchored to resist overturning and uplift.\nThe walls, ceiling, and door of the shelter must withstand wind pressure and resist penetration by windborne objects and falling debris.\nThe connections between all parts of the safe room must be strong enough to resist the wind.\nSections of either interior or exterior residence walls that are used as walls of the safe room, must be separated from the structure of the residence so that damage to the residence will not cause damage to the safe room.\n\nLast Modified: Thursday, 06-Apr-2006 11:47:30 EDT\n\nRelated Topics\n\nTornado Photos\n\nHome\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImportant Notices\nFOIA\nNo FEAR Act Data\nUSA.gov\nDHS\n\nFEMA 500 C Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20472Disaster Assistance: (800) 621-FEMA, TTY (800) 462-7585\n\n \n\n", "title": "FEMA: Preparing a Safe Room", "source": "https://webarchive.library.unt.edu/eot2008/20081024151059/http://www.fema.gov/hazard/tornado/to_saferoom.shtm"}, {"document_id": "57945b90ec0bcb30-1606-3822", "score": 0.113089442253112, "text": "FEMA: What to do During a Hazardous Materials Incident\nIf possible, cover mouth with a cloth while leaving the area.\n\nStay away from accident victims until the hazardous material has been identified.\n\nIn a motor vehicle\nStop and seek shelter in a permanent building. If you must remain in your car, keep car windows and vents closed and shut off the air conditioner and heater.\n\nRequested to stay indoors\nBring pets inside.\n\nClose and lock all exterior doors and windows. Close vents, fireplace dampers, and as many interior doors as possible.\n\nTurn off air conditioners and ventilation systems. In large buildings, set ventilation systems to 100 percent recirculation so that no outside air is drawn into the building. If this is not possible, ventilation systems should be turned off.\n\nGo into the pre-selected shelter room. This room should be above ground and have the fewest openings to the outside.\n\nSeal gaps under doorways and windows with wet towels or plastic sheeting and duct tape.\n\nSeal gaps around window and air conditioning units, bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans, and stove and dryer vents with duct tape and plastic sheeting, wax paper or aluminum wrap.\n\nUse material to fill cracks and holes in the room, such as those around pipes.\n\nIf gas or vapors could have entered the building, take shallow breaths through a cloth or a towel. Avoid eating or drinking any food or water that may be contaminated.\n\nShelter Safety for Sealed Rooms\nTen square feet of floor space per person will provide sufficient air to prevent carbon dioxide build-up for up to five hours, assuming a normal breathing rate while resting.\nHowever, local officials are unlikely to recommend the public shelter in a sealed room for more than 2-3 hours because the effectiveness of such sheltering diminishes with time as the contaminated outside air gradually seeps into the shelter. At this point, evacuation from the area is the better protective action to take.\nAlso you should ventilate the shelter when the emergency has passed to avoid breathing contaminated air still inside the shelter.\n\nLast Modified: Thursday, 06-Apr-2006 10:08:51 EDT\n\nRelated Topics\n\nHazmat Photos\n\nGovernment Links\n\nOffice of Hazardous Materials Safety\n\nHome\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImportant Notices", "title": "FEMA: What to do During a Hazardous Materials Incident", "source": "https://webarchive.library.unt.edu/eot2008/20090505205842/https://www.fema.gov/hazard/hazmat/hz_during.shtm"}, {"document_id": "7d4d64e7f6aff125-1590-3637", "score": 0.06735827028751301, "text": "FAQs \u2022 Disaster Preparedness\nWhat are the important points to remember in case we are told to \"shelter-in-place?\"\n\r\nYou should be in a place that will afford you protection from a contaminant in the air.

Buildings swept off their foundations. Appliances, personal belongings and business inventory submerged and destroyed. These scenes are common during floods. But there are steps to take to protect your property. It is less expensive to protect your property before it is damaged from a flood than to repair or replace it afterward.\nWhat can you do to protect yourself from floods?\n\nBuy flood insurance\n\nNearly 25 percent of flood insurance claims come from properties considered to be at low or moderate risk of flooding. So, even if you do not live in a high-risk area, flood insurance is a good idea. Devastating floods in the United States cause more than $2 billion in property damage each year. Most homeowners and business insurance policies do not cover flood loss.\n\nMake changes to your house or property\n\nHow Does Mitigation Help?\nMitigation is the effort to reduce the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters. A recent study by the Multihazard Mitigation Council shows that each dollar spent on mitigation saves an average of four dollars.

For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat.", "title": "FAQs \u2022 Dublin \u2022 CivicEngage", "source": "https://dublin.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx"}, {"document_id": "7d4d64e7f6aff125-1590-3637", "score": 0.8608514070510861, "text": "FAQs \u2022 Disaster Preparedness\nWhat are the important points to remember in case we are told to \"shelter-in-place?\"\n\r\nYou should be in a place that will afford you protection from a contaminant in the air.

Please do not confuse the recommendation to have at least three days worth of disaster supplies on hand with the amount of time that you may be asked to shelter-in-place. We always recommend having at least three days worth of supplies in case stores are closed and roads are impossible due to a disaster like a flood or winter storm. \t\n\n3.\nDoes the Red Cross recommend stocking duct tape and plastic sheeting?\n\r\nYes. These materials have always been recommended to have as part of a Disasters Supplies Kit. They may be needed if the public is advised by local authorities to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n4.\nI'm confused about this duct tape and plastic sheeting recommendation. Am I supposed to seal my whole house and do it now? How much do I need?

The Red Cross recommends that people have these supplies on hand in case they are needed.You would seal only one room when advised to do so, and do it only when instructed - not in advance. It is likely that one roll of duct tape will be adequate. Plastic sheeting of durable thickness (thicker than food wrap) is recommended for covering vents and other openings to the outside - not the entire room. It is intended to provide a barrier to air flow. While we can not guarantee that plastic sheeting over air vents will stop all biological, chemical, or radiological agents, it will add to the barrier of protection for your safety.\t\n\n5.\nDo I need a safe room?

Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands.

Often, the goal is to clear forests or manage crops and pastures, though there are an array of other reasons including burning trash or starting cooking fires. Some fires are unintentional ignitions associated with human activity, including discarded cigarettes or sparks from electrical or farming equipment.\nIn 2023, as researchers forecasted months in advance, the peak of fire season coincided with an ongoing El Ni\u00f1o and a drought in the northern and western part of the basin that worsened the burning. Outbreaks of fire were particularly intense in Amazonas, Para, and Amap\u00e1, according to satellite observations. In these areas, drought conditions followed by hot and dry weather have enlarged fires that would have otherwise been unable to spread.\nThe MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor on NASA\u2019s Terra satellite captured an image (top of the page) showing smoke streaming from fires burning near Manaus on October 11, 2023. The city, a transportation and manufacturing hub deep in the rainforest, is the capital city of Brazil\u2019s Amazonas state.

Some of the most notable include the Camp Fire in 2018, which destroyed the town of Paradise and had a significant impact on the local population, and the North Bay Fires in 2017, which had severe consequences and destroyed over 8,000 structures. \n\nThe New Normal\n\nClimate change, drought conditions, and a buildup of dry vegetation have all contributed to the increase in wildfires. In 2020, over 9,000 wildfires burned over 4.2 million acres in California, causing widespread destruction and significant loss of life and property. As a result, CAL FIRE and other organizations have implemented various measures to reduce the risk of wildfires, including increased fire prevention efforts, better firefighting technology and resources, and community preparedness initiatives.\n\nCooperation is Key\n\nCooperative efforts between state, federal and local agencies are key in responding to emergencies such as wildfires, floods, earthquakes, spills and medical aids in California. CAL FIRE coordinates these efforts through contracts and agreements and may provide dispatch, paramedic, fire and rescue services in cities and towns across the state.

Parks also provide connectivity for these species to migrate and adapt to variable conditions.\n\nFor these reasons, growing, preserving and optimizing parkland here and everywhere is essential for our collective health and safety. For agencies like Sonoma County Regional Parks, our mission intersects with an imperative shared by everyone: to fight climate change and minimize its effects. Sonoma County Regional Parks is in the process of developing a Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan, which will help address climate change impacts and protect natural resources.\nWildfire, drought, and other dangers\nCalifornia and the West have experienced a noticeable increase, both in frequency and severity, of storm surges, floods, droughts, heat waves, high-wind events and wildfires. Many of these weather patterns amplify each other \u2014 for example, the combination of extreme drought, heat and wind has resulted in unprecedented wildfires throughout the Western United States.\nOver the past few years, record-breaking wildfires in Sonoma County have turned local parks into battlegrounds. Hood Mountain Regional Park & Preserve was severely burned during the Nuns fire in 2017 and again during the Glass fire in 2020 \u2014 but in both cases firefighters held the fires at the park, saving neighborhoods in Santa Rosa. Similarly, Foothill Regional Park became a frontline during the Kincade fire in 2019, and although nearly all of the park burned, firefighters held the fire there and saved the neighboring town of Windsor.\nThese dramatic examples show how important parks are in keeping Sonoma County communities safer from the effects of climate change. And extreme wildfire isn\u2019t the only threat we\u2019re now facing.

Any solution to climate change must reduce greenhouse gasses in two ways: by stopping further emissions, and by drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through \u201csequestration,\u201d which traps it in the ground and in vegetation.\nSequestration is greatly aided by the presence of parks because healthy open space acts as a natural carbon sink. As trees and other plants grow, they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen; when they decompose, some of that carbon becomes sequestered in the soil. The more parks and open space we have, and the healthier and greener those places are, the more sequestration will occur.\nPreparing for the future\nAdaptation means acknowledging that climate change is happening and preparing accordingly. For Sonoma County Regional Parks, wildfire, flooding, sea level rise and habitat and species loss are among the challenges we must prepare for in the years ahead.\nIn some cases, that\u2019s best accomplished by continuing to use smart land management practices. Grazing, prescribed burns and invasive species removal can help us manage wildfires. Stream restoration can reduce erosion and alleviate flooding. These and other practices improve native habitat, resulting in more robust and resilient ecosystems. Sustainable water management and drought preparedness are critical components to resilient park management.\u00a0\nSonoma County coordinates its larger adaptation and mitigation efforts through the Sonoma County Regional Climate Protection Authority. This agency, which brings county and city leaders together on a variety of climate-related issues, commissioned experts from the North Bay Climate Adaptation Initiative to develop a local assessment of climate risks. The resulting report, \u201cClimate Ready Sonoma County,\u201d provides an important blueprint for adapting to climate change locally at both the individual and societal level.\nA local and global mandate", "title": "Climate Change", "source": "https://parks.sonomacounty.ca.gov/learn/natural-resources/climate-change"}, {"document_id": "5306392549c81595-33021-35362", "score": 0.0017122413264580002, "text": "Global Warming\nThe shift in seasons may already be causing the lifecycles of pollinators, like bees, to be out of synch with flowering plants and trees. This mismatch can limit the ability of both pollinators and plants to survive and reproduce, which would reduce food availability throughout the food chain.\nSee Buzzing About Climate Change to read more about how the lifecycle of bees is synched with flowering plants.\nWarmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing throughout the season or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires. Once the growing season ends, shorter, milder winters fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons.\nIn some ecosystems, maximum daily temperatures might climb beyond the tolerance of indigenous plant or animal. To survive the extreme temperatures, both marine and land-based plants and animals have started to migrate towards the poles. Those species, and in some cases, entire ecosystems, that cannot quickly migrate or adapt, face extinction. The IPCC estimates that 20-30 percent of plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction if temperatures climb more than 1.5\u00b0 to 2.5\u00b0C.\nImpacting People\nThe changes to weather and ecosystems will also affect people more directly. Hardest hit will be those living in low-lying coastal areas, and residents of poorer countries who do not have the resources to adapt to changes in temperature extremes and water resources. As tropical temperature zones expand, the reach of some infectious diseases, such as malaria, will change. More intense rains and hurricanes and rising sea levels will lead to more severe flooding and potential loss of property and life.\n\nOne inevitable consequence of global warming is sea-level rise. In the face of higher sea levels and more intense storms, coastal communities face greater risk of rapid beach erosion from destructive storms like the intense nor\u2019easter of April 2007 that caused this damage.

The use of toxic chemical pesticides or neglecting vehicular maintenance, can further pollute our water supply. These substances inevitably end up in our waterways, contaminating local lakes, rivers, streams and the ocean. Thankfully, there are simple steps all of us can take to reduce stormwater pollution and help keep our water clean.\nCalifornians can positively impact the environment by taking necessary steps to minimize contributions to water pollution. The \u201cLet\u2019s Change This to That\u201d campaign via CleanWaterCA.com\u00a0provides a list of tips to help support clean water from summer to winter and all year round. They include:\nPick up after your pet. A common misconception is that pet waste is a natural fertilizer and can be left to decompose in the environment. Not so! Pet waste can contain harmful bacteria such as E. coli and fecal coliform, which can carry diseases that affect wildlife and contaminate waterways when not properly disposed of.\nSave water. Reduce water pollution by sweeping your driveway instead of using the hose and, if you can, by washing your car at a facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency warns that washing cars and driveways at home can cause pollution as metals and fluids are washed off and enter storm drains, collecting more pollutants along the way and ending up in our waterways. If you can, choose car wash facilities that use advanced filtration systems to recycle water used for washing cars.\nGo organic. This summer consider using natural pest control methods instead of harmful pesticides. Pesticides made from highly toxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on the health of our water and the environment. By choosing organic alternatives, like companion planting or using beneficial insects like ladybugs, you can make a difference.\nGive your vehicle a tune-up.

Common pollutants can be chemicals from lawns and yards, pet waste, leaked auto fluids, cigarette butts, litter, trash and much more.\nPolluted stormwater doesn\u2019t go through wastewater treatment so it ends up directly deposited into waterways along with any contaminants that have accumulated.\nStormwater matters because it affects the quality of water used daily by humans, as well as wildlife in our local ecosystems.\nHow does stormwater impact me?\nStormwater directly impacts the quality of our waterways, neighborhoods, communities, and environment.\n\n Polluted stormwater is a significant source of overall water pollution in California.\nWhen polluted stormwater flows into our waterways, it greatly reduces the quality of water used for recreation, drinking, washing and fishing.\nOver 14.8 million vehicles are on the road in our state, which means there a lot contributors to litter, motor oil, heavy metals, and other auto fluids on our highways.\nStormwater pollution can lead to unsanitary living conditions and neighborhood flooding during the rainy season.\n\nSmall actions can have a major impact on our waterways, let\u2019s all work together\u00a0to change our habits and prevent stormwater pollution.\n\nStormwater Links\n\nAbout Stormwater\nPollutants\nResources\nGet involved\nOur Partners\n\nWaterways\n\nUnlike sewer systems - which lead to a wastewater treatment plant - storm drains empty directly into waterways, depositing untreated stormwater.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPet Waste\n\nPet waste is very toxic\u2014the EPA estimates that waste produced by just 100 dogs in one weekend can contain enough bacteria to temporarily close a bay to swimming and shellfishing.

A TMDL is developed for each pollutant contributing to the impairment of a listed water body. The development of a TMDL involves the following\r\nsteps:\n\nDetermination of how much of a particular pollutant a water body can receive from all sources and still meet water quality standards. \nDetermination of how much of the existing level of pollution must be reduced to meet water quality standards. \nAllocation of responsibility for reducing pollution to the acceptable level among the various contributing sources, including both point and nonpoint sources.\nDevelopment of a plan to implement the TMDL.

For\r\nexample, the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) would be involved if pesticides were the pollutants of concern, and the California Department of\r\nForestry and Fire Protection (CDFFP) would comment on a TMDL if timber harvesting was contributing to the impairment of a water body. The Department of\r\nFish and Game would be involved if fish and wildlife were beneficial uses of water that were impacted in an impaired water body.\nThe list of impaired water bodies and TMDLs are submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for its review and approval. If U.S. EPA\r\nrejects a particular TMDL, it must establish the TMDL itself. In some cases, the development of TMDLs is carried out under a federal court settlement. These\r\nTMDLs may be developed by U.S. EPA or delegated by U.S. EPA to the state to develop.\nThe TMDL Requirements Largely Ignored from 1972 to the Early 1990s. The requirement for TMDLs was largely ignored by federal and state water quality\r\nagencies until the early 1990s. Until then, water quality regulation had been focused on controlling point sources of pollution through state and federal\r\npermitting programs. Although water quality had been improving, over 40 percent of assessed water bodies nationwide remained too polluted for fishing or\r\nswimming. It became apparent that the remaining water pollution problems\u2014largely associated with nonpoint source pollution\u2014required different solutions. The\r\nactivation of the TMDL program in the 1990s, in part instigated by lawsuits against the federal government to enforce the TMDL requirements, provides a\r\nplanning framework to address these problems.\nCurrent State List of Impaired Water Bodies.

Toxicity from mercury pollution of water bodies can lead to decreased reproductive success of loons as well.Forests - Sulfur and nitrogen deposition have caused adverse impacts on highly-sensitive forest ecosystems, especially the high-elevation, spruce-fir forests in the eastern United States. Forests are damaged because acid precipitation drains nutrients from the soil. Excess nitrogen in the air also may adversely affect tree growth. Evidence of decreased growth and dieback has been found in the Adirondacks.Visibility - The same pollutants that cause acid rain can degrade air quality and significantly reduce visibility, even in remote areas like the Adirondack Mountains.Architecture - For buildings, bridges and cultural resources, acid deposition can cause damage. The sulfuric acid can have a corrosive effect on limestone and marble buildings and sculptures. Dry deposition can even be more damaging to stone than wet deposition for these structures.Human Health - Walking in acid rain is no more dangerous to people than walking in non-acid rain. However, the pollutants that cause acid rain can be harmful to people. SO2 and NO2 can react in the atmosphere to form fine sulfate and nitrate particles. These particles can enter the lungs and cause lung disease, heart attacks, and difficulties for people with asthma. Acidified water can also cause metals to be leached from the soil into streams, lakes and reservoirs or old lead and copper pipes into home water supplies, causing serious illness.\n\nThings You Can Do to Help\n\nConserve energy in your home and office.\n\nUtilize public transportation, carpool, or walk.\n\nBuy clean electric power.\n\nNew York's Acid Deposition Monitoring NetworkNew York's first acid deposition program was established in 1985 in response to the State Acid Deposition Control Act (SADCA).

Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas.

The use of toxic chemical pesticides or neglecting vehicular maintenance, can further pollute our water supply.

Thankfully, there are simple steps all of us can take to reduce stormwater pollution and help keep our water clean.\nCalifornians can positively impact the environment by taking necessary steps to minimize contributions to water pollution. The \u201cLet\u2019s Change This to That\u201d campaign via CleanWaterCA.com\u00a0provides a list of tips to help support clean water from summer to winter and all year round. They include:\nPick up after your pet. A common misconception is that pet waste is a natural fertilizer and can be left to decompose in the environment. Not so! Pet waste can contain harmful bacteria such as E. coli and fecal coliform, which can carry diseases that affect wildlife and contaminate waterways when not properly disposed of.\nSave water. Reduce water pollution by sweeping your driveway instead of using the hose and, if you can, by washing your car at a facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency warns that washing cars and driveways at home can cause pollution as metals and fluids are washed off and enter storm drains, collecting more pollutants along the way and ending up in our waterways. If you can, choose car wash facilities that use advanced filtration systems to recycle water used for washing cars.\nGo organic. This summer consider using natural pest control methods instead of harmful pesticides. Pesticides made from highly toxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on the health of our water and the environment. By choosing organic alternatives, like companion planting or using beneficial insects like ladybugs, you can make a difference.\nGive your vehicle a tune-up.

Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\t\n\n5.\nWhat is ground water?\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge or towel. \t\n\n6.\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\n\r\nThe San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of us. \t\n\n7.\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze.

The \"\"enterprise value\"\" is basically how much the business would be worth if it had no cash or no debt.  These numbers would be a very unusual situation. It could happen for example if a big company has sold 90% of its business for cash. When you buy a share of the company, you get a tiny share of the business and you own a tiny share of the cash. This stock will very likely keep its value, but won't make much money.  On the other hand, more common would be a company where the business is worth 4bn, but the company has also 4bn debt.

For example, you find out that simiral internet companies are being traded at a price that is 15 times their projected dividends (its called a Price Earning Ratio). Then, if you see that Facebook, all else being equal, is trading at 10 times its projected dividends, you could say that buying it would be at a discount.

You can open a business checking account and there will be various options for types of accounts and fees. You may or may not want an overdraft account, for example, or a separate business credit card just so you can more easily separate those expenses from your personal cards.

I can only think of two main reasons why people might suggest separating your bank accounts in this way: security and accounting. The security reasoning might go something like this: My employer has access to my bank account, because he direct deposits my salary into my account.  I don't want my employer to have access to all my money, so I'll have a separate account that my employer has access to, and once the salary is deposited, I can move that money into my real account. The fault in this reasoning is that a direct deposit setup doesn't really give your employer withdrawal access to your account, and your employer doesn't have any reason to pull money out of your account after he has paid you.  If fraud is going to happen, it much more likely to happen in the account that you are doing your spending out of. The other reason might be accounting.  Perhaps you have several bank accounts, and you use the different accounts to separate your money for different purposes.  For example, you might have a checking account that you do most of your monthly spending out of, you might have a savings account that you use to store your emergency fund, and you have more savings accounts to keep track of how much you have saved toward your next car, or your vacation, or your Christmas fund, or whatever.  After you get your salary deposited, you can move some into your spending account and some into your various savings accounts for different purposes. Instead of having many bank accounts, I find it easier to do my budgeting/accounting on my own, not relying on the bank accounts to tell me how much money I have allocated to each purpose.  I only have one checking account where my income goes; my own records keep track of how much money in that account is set aside for each purpose.  When the checking account balance gets too large, I move a chunk of it over to my one savings account, which earns a little more interest than the checking account does.  I can always move money back into my checking account if I need to spend it for some reason, and the amount of money in each of the two accounts is not directly related to the purpose of the money.

I can only think of two main reasons why people might suggest separating your bank accounts in this way: security and accounting. The security reasoning might go something like this: My employer has access to my bank account, because he direct deposits my salary into my account.  I don't want my employer to have access to all my money, so I'll have a separate account that my employer has access to, and once the salary is deposited, I can move that money into my real account. The fault in this reasoning is that a direct deposit setup doesn't really give your employer withdrawal access to your account, and your employer doesn't have any reason to pull money out of your account after he has paid you.  If fraud is going to happen, it much more likely to happen in the account that you are doing your spending out of. The other reason might be accounting.  Perhaps you have several bank accounts, and you use the different accounts to separate your money for different purposes.  For example, you might have a checking account that you do most of your monthly spending out of, you might have a savings account that you use to store your emergency fund, and you have more savings accounts to keep track of how much you have saved toward your next car, or your vacation, or your Christmas fund, or whatever.  After you get your salary deposited, you can move some into your spending account and some into your various savings accounts for different purposes. Instead of having many bank accounts, I find it easier to do my budgeting/accounting on my own, not relying on the bank accounts to tell me how much money I have allocated to each purpose.  I only have one checking account where my income goes; my own records keep track of how much money in that account is set aside for each purpose.  When the checking account balance gets too large, I move a chunk of it over to my one savings account, which earns a little more interest than the checking account does.  I can always move money back into my checking account if I need to spend it for some reason, and the amount of money in each of the two accounts is not directly related to the purpose of the money.

It may be best to take the 47 month loan, because it keeps the middle rate for a long time. You want to lock in the lowest rate you can, for the longest period they allow. The longer period keeps the required minimum monthly payment as low as possible. The lower rate saves you on interest. Remember you generally can pay the loan off sooner by making extra or larger payments. Leasing. Never lease unless you are writing off the monthly lease payment as a business expense. If the choice is monthly lease payments or depreciation for tax purposes the lease can make the most sense. If business taxes aren't involved then leasing only means that you have a complex deal where you finance the most expensive part of the ownership period, you have to watch the mileage for several years, and you may have to pay a large amount at the end of the period for damages and excess miles. Plus many times you don't end up with the car at the end of the lease.  In the United States one way to get a good deal if you have to get a loan: take the rebate from the dealer; and the loan from a bank/credit Union. The interest rate at banking institution is a better range of rates and length. Plus you get the dealer cash.

I can say that I pay cash for all my cars and always get cars for lower than the TrueCar low-end. There are basically two steps: go test drive, negotiate fully, leave (unless you are given a mind-blowing offer). This may take you one to many dealerships. It depends on how well you know what car you want and how much a dealership will negotiate. you pick a night that another dealership that specifically has the car you want (or multiple - even better) is open and you go in 30-45 mins before they close. Paying cash is key for this to work. By the time you get to numbers they will be almost closed. Their finance guy might be gone so you will get your salesman and a manager. I will use my last car as an example. Toyota Highlander 2015 with MSRB 32,995. TrueCar at 29,795 with a good deal at 29,400. I simply talked to my sales guy said I would like to walk out with the car tonight. I have already talked to XYZ dealership and they offered me 28,500 - which is already below TrueCar low price. I asked for $27,900. Boom 10 minutes later car bought at 28,100. Cash is king. The sales guy and manager will bite the bullet on profit for ease of sale. Going in late is the key to using the cash. You don't have the finance guys jumping in and you have less people to move through. Also they know they have limited time to deal and if you walk off the lot there is less than 10% chance of you coming back - they want to close. They are making minimal profit but doing minimal work. With cash your sales guy is on your side because you are basically throwing him a couple hundred dollars at the end of a shift (where most would just be sitting around watching TV). Some other tips: be fair. If they would have said 28,300 is our lowest that we can go and that's it. I probably would have still got the car.

(Personally, I recently signed up for one such plan with Google and I had a hard inquiry but no debt added to my report). The other risks are that 1) your monthly payment goes up, so if you are living on a tight budget the added payment might make it harder to meet your next bill, and 2) you could miss a payment which generally triggers interest to accrue retroactively at a high rate, and in some cases could be grounds for immediate repayment. The pro / reward of these plans is that you have to spend less of your capital upfront, which you may be able to use for other purposes (presumably with a higher net present value than purchasing the item you're considering outright). A larger example would be purchasing a new car. You want to buy a $50k car and you have the cash on hand to pay in full, but you are being offered 0% interest for 36 months. You may be more inclined to take a loan at 0% with 0 down payment and invest your money in another vehicle (no pun intended) that offers you a decent rate of return and you will come out ahead in the end. Of course, this example works in a perfect world where you can get such an offer, there are no extra fees available, you aren't worrying about your debt-to-income ratio in preparation for a big purchase like a house, there isn't a higher insurance premium to consider, etc. In short, 0% financing, be it for a phone or a car, can be a nice perk for the informed consumer who is not using the financing as a way to purchase outside their financial means, but it is offered by companies as a way to make people buy things they normally would not and, hopefully, capitalize on people missing payments in order to reap the sweet 20%+ interest rates generally seen with these offers.

(John knows what is talking about though; he gave an awesome answer on buying a car: What are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations?) The answer to your question is based on whether or you not you can stand to have a small, loud, cheap but reliable car for the next 10 or 15 years. If you plan to keep your new car until it dies 20 years from now, then a new car can be a fine choice. I just bought a car and the difference between my 2013 Hyundai and a comparable 2012 Hyundai wasn't much. Furthermore, it was hard to even find a 2012 (which justifies the higher price from dealerships and the private market). Doing math in my head told me the reduced usage I will get out of the car wasn't offset by the slightly lower price. Depending on the specific age, insurance on newer cars can be cheaper than insurance on older cars. (But you have to have carry more insurance, so consider that as well.) There might not be a different between a 2010 and a 2012, but there will likely be for a 2005 and the 2013. New cars can be cheaper to operate. Lower fuel costs, better safety and possibly pollution costs. They are tuned up and you know everything about their history. Repairs and factory warranties might not be available on a used car, so if you car turns out to be a problem, your out of pocket is limited. These programs don't mean anything. Get an independent certified mechanic to check out any used car you buy. If the dealer won't let you get the car checked out, then they aren't worth your business. Certified cars don't justify their cost according to consumer reports, they are more for marketing than reliability. Don't waste money on a third party warranty.

If you buy a used car, there is a fair chance that it will need some sort of repairs, and there probably is no warranty. But think about how much repairs are likely to cost. A new car these days costs like $25,000 or more. You can find reasonably decent used cars for a few thousand dollars. Say you bought a used car for $2,000. Is it likely that it will need $23,000 in repairs? No way. Even if you had to make thousands of dollars worth of repairs to the used car, it would almost certainly be cheaper than buying a new car. I've bought three used vehicles in the last few years, one for me, one for my son, and one for my daughter. I paid, let's see, I think between $4,000 and $6,000 each. We've had my son's car for about 9 months and to date had $40 in repairs. My daughter's car turned out to have a bunch of problems; I ended up putting maybe another $2,000 into it. But now she's got a car she's very happy with that cost me maybe $6,000 between purchase and repairs, still way less than a new car. My pickup had big time problems, including needing a new transmission and a new engine. I've put, hmm, maybe $7,000 into it. It's definitely debatable if it was worth replacing the engine. But even at all that, if I had bought that truck new it would have cost over $30,000. Presumably if I bought new I would have had a nicer vehicle and I could have gotten exactly the options I wanted, so I'm not entirely happy with how this one turned out, but I still saved money by buying used. Here's what I do when I buy a used car: I go into it expecting that there will be repairs.

Capital Allocation - A buyer may need a vehicle (either to commute to work, school, doctor, or for work or business), but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase. Vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend, so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts (credit cards, loans).

We lack the road or electrical grid infrastructure to support tens of millions of electric vehicles throughout the US, this will take far more than just 5-10 years, especially in the more rural parts of the country. 2. We lack the production capacity to create the batteries for 17 million of yearly sales of automobiles for the few years between 2021-2025 when everyone is presumably just buying only electric self driving cars. 3.

There are two major advantages that electric has over oil. The first is that electricity is abundant and can come from many sources. This means that a car can be running on power from coal, wind, solar, hydro-electric, or any other source of electricity. This also means that the cost per mile driven is generally lower than the cost of a gas driven car.   Another big advantage is the national security it offers.

Clipper ships were streamlined, three-masted sailing vessels renowned for their grace and swiftness. These ships rapidly shuttled tea and other goods back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean and around the globe.\nIn the grand tradition of these classic ships, the Europa Clipper spacecraft would sail past Europa at a rapid cadence, as frequently as every two weeks, providing many opportunities to investigate the moon up close. The prime mission plan includes 40 to 45 flybys, during which the spacecraft would image the moon's icy surface at high resolution and investigate its composition and the structure of its interior and icy shell.\nEuropa has long been a high priority for exploration because it holds a salty liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. The ultimate aim of Europa Clipper is to determine if Europa is habitable, possessing all three of the ingredients necessary for life: liquid water, chemical ingredients, and energy sources sufficient to enable biology. \n\"During each orbit, the spacecraft spends only a short time within the challenging radiation environment near Europa. It speeds past, gathers a huge amount of science data, then sails on out of there,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nPreviously, when the mission was still in the conceptual phase, it was sometimes informally called Europa Clipper, but NASA has now adopted that name as the formal title for the mission.\nThe mission is being planned for launch in the 2020s, arriving in the Jupiter system after a journey of several years.", "title": "NASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper' \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper", "source": "https://europa.nasa.gov/news/2/nasa-mission-named-europa-clipper/"}, {"document_id": "112a00567c15fc3b-1605-4016", "score": 0.9971738457679741, "text": "Mission Dispatch: Tweaking the Trajectory \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper\nThe collective goal of all the flybys is to confirm or disprove that Europa has a subsurface water ocean, and to assess whether the icy moon has the chemistry, energy input, and other conditions needed to support some form of life.\nDifferent proposed tours send Europa Clipper over different swaths of the moon\u2019s surface (called groundtracks) on different dates, at different cadences, at different distances, and at different places in Europa\u2019s orbit. The spacecraft\u2019s science instruments and investigations are required to make certain observations, and each has its own ideal conditions for those observations. \n\nMechanical engineers set up Europa Clipper's wide-angle camera outside of a thermal-vacuum chamber. The wide-angle camera is part of the spacecraft's Europa Imaging System, or EIS (pronounced \"ICE\"), which also includes a narrow-angle camera. The cameras, each with an eight-megapixel sensor, will produce high-resolution color and stereoscopic images of Europa. They will study geologic activity, measure surface elevations, and provide context for other instruments. \n\nFor example, to reveal the moon\u2019s internal structure, the gravity science investigation needs the spacecraft to pass through Europa\u2019s gravity field several times when the moon is both near Jupiter and farther from Jupiter. On the other hand, the visible wavelength cameras need to observe Europa\u2019s surface in a variety of lighting conditions and at a variety of distances to study surface features and to map the moon at a higher resolution than ever before. \nThe mission design team strives to not only accommodate both the cameras and gravity science, but also the seven other instruments and investigations onboard Europa Clipper, each with their own required observations. Tour design must also manage fuel consumption, time between flybys, mission duration, cumulative radiation, ensure communication with Earth during key events, ensure the solar panels receive enough sunlight, and much more. Each proposed tour aims to find the right balance between fulfilling scientific objectives and meeting the demands of operating the spacecraft. \nLong before a single instrument or solar panel for Europa Clipper was assembled, Buffington\u2019s team had already started developing possible science tours. Over many years, they presented possible tours to the mission\u2019s leading engineers and scientists, who then provided feedback.", "title": "Mission Dispatch: Tweaking the Trajectory \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper", "source": "https://europa.nasa.gov/mission-updates/38/mission-dispatch-tweaking-the-trajectory/"}, {"document_id": "c3c65a23f89d1f39-1697-3934", "score": 0.997163593769073, "text": "Science | Mission \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper\nEuropa Clipper is not a life detection mission \u2013 its main science goal is to determine whether there are places below Europa\u2019s surface that could support life.\n\nEuropa Up Close\n\nTake an in-depth look at Jupiter's icy moon and Europa Clipper's plans for investigation.\n\nLearn more \u203a\n\nScience ObjectivesScience Objectives\nEuropa Clipper has three main science objectives: \n\nDetermine the Thickness of Europa\u2019s Icy Shell & How the Ocean Interacts With the Surface\n\nScientists aim to determine the thickness of Europa\u2019s icy shell \u2013 the moon\u2019s outer layer that includes its surface.

That region is the star\u2019s habitable zone or \"Goldilocks zone.\u201d But scientists have learned that worlds outside the Goldilocks zone can have liquid oceans as well, including several moons in our outer solar system.\nSome moons of Saturn and Jupiter (including Europa, we suspect) are ocean worlds \u2013 they have oceans beneath their icy surfaces.

A meteorite collides with a planet and ejects surface material containing microbes. The rocky chunks float through space until some collide with another planet.

Not only does it look like a spacecraft now that it has the big antenna, but it\u2019s ready for its upcoming critical tests as we progress towards launch.\u201d\nThe spacecraft will train nine science instruments on Europa, all producing large amounts of rich data: high-resolution color and stereo images to study its geology and surface; thermal images in infrared light to find warmer areas where water could be near the surface; reflected infrared light to map ices, salts, and organics; and ultraviolet light readings to help determine the makeup of atmospheric gases and surface materials.\nClipper will bounce ice-penetrating radar off the subsurface ocean to determine its depth, as well as the thickness of the ice crust above it. A magnetometer will measure the moon\u2019s magnetic field to confirm the deep ocean\u2019s existence and the thickness of the ice.\n\nClick on this interactive visualization of Europa and take it for a spin!

Clipper ships were streamlined, three-masted sailing vessels renowned for their grace and swiftness. These ships rapidly shuttled tea and other goods back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean and around the globe.\nIn the grand tradition of these classic ships, the Europa Clipper spacecraft would sail past Europa at a rapid cadence, as frequently as every two weeks, providing many opportunities to investigate the moon up close. The prime mission plan includes 40 to 45 flybys, during which the spacecraft would image the moon's icy surface at high resolution and investigate its composition and the structure of its interior and icy shell.\nEuropa has long been a high priority for exploration because it holds a salty liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. The ultimate aim of Europa Clipper is to determine if Europa is habitable, possessing all three of the ingredients necessary for life: liquid water, chemical ingredients, and energy sources sufficient to enable biology. \n\"During each orbit, the spacecraft spends only a short time within the challenging radiation environment near Europa. It speeds past, gathers a huge amount of science data, then sails on out of there,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nPreviously, when the mission was still in the conceptual phase, it was sometimes informally called Europa Clipper, but NASA has now adopted that name as the formal title for the mission.\nThe mission is being planned for launch in the 2020s, arriving in the Jupiter system after a journey of several years.", "title": "NASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper' \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper", "source": "https://europa.nasa.gov/news/2/nasa-mission-named-europa-clipper/"}, {"document_id": "61a453a165405075-11349-13509", "score": 0.992241978645324, "text": "FAQ | Mission \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper\nEuropa Clipper\u2019s orbit around Jupiter is preferable due to the belts of intense\u00a0 radiation that surround the planet, which can damage electronics.

The main body of the spacecraft consists of its avionics vault, radiofrequency module, and propulsion module. \r\nAt launch, Europa Clipper will weigh approximately 13,000 pounds (6,000 kilograms). Almost half of the weight will be fuel \u2013 nearly 6,000 pounds (2,750 kilograms) of propellant. \nEuropa Clipper will launch in October 2024 on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The spacecraft will fly by Mars, then back by Earth, using the gravity of each planet to increase its momentum. These so-called \u201cgravity assists\u201d will provide Europa Clipper with the velocity needed to reach Jupiter in 2030.\nAfter it begins orbiting Jupiter, Europa Clipper will spend about a year altering its trajectory to prepare for its first Europa flyby. The spacecraft will then spend about three years soaring past Europa dozens of times and sending data back to Earth. Over the course of the mission, the spacecraft will investigate nearly the entire moon.\nFast Facts\nEuropa Clipper Fast Facts\n\nWith its solar arrays deployed, Europa Clipper spans more than 100 feet (about 30 meters) \u2013 about the length of a basketball court.\nThe spacecraft has 24 engines.", "title": "Meet Europa Clipper | Spacecraft \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper", "source": "https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft"}, {"document_id": "15a9b4e99e304cb1-2-2227", "score": 0.9317775368690491, "text": "NASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper' \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper\nNASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper' \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper\n\nNASA\n\nEuropa Clipper\n\nSkip Navigation\n\nmenu\n\nclose modal\n\nNews\n\n| March 9, 2017\n\nNASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper'\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper mission is being designed to fly by the icy Jovian moon multiple times and investigate whether it possesses the ingredients necessary for life.\nCredits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute\n\nNASA's upcoming mission to investigate the habitability of Jupiter's icy moon Europa now has a formal name: Europa Clipper.\nThe moniker harkens back to the clipper ships that sailed across the oceans of Earth in the 19th century. Clipper ships were streamlined, three-masted sailing vessels renowned for their grace and swiftness. These ships rapidly shuttled tea and other goods back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean and around the globe.\nIn the grand tradition of these classic ships, the Europa Clipper spacecraft would sail past Europa at a rapid cadence, as frequently as every two weeks, providing many opportunities to investigate the moon up close. The prime mission plan includes 40 to 45 flybys, during which the spacecraft would image the moon's icy surface at high resolution and investigate its composition and the structure of its interior and icy shell.\nEuropa has long been a high priority for exploration because it holds a salty liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. The ultimate aim of Europa Clipper is to determine if Europa is habitable, possessing all three of the ingredients necessary for life: liquid water, chemical ingredients, and energy sources sufficient to enable biology. \n\"During each orbit, the spacecraft spends only a short time within the challenging radiation environment near Europa. It speeds past, gathers a huge amount of science data, then sails on out of there,\" said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nPreviously, when the mission was still in the conceptual phase, it was sometimes informally called Europa Clipper, but NASA has now adopted that name as the formal title for the mission.\nThe mission is being planned for launch in the 2020s, arriving in the Jupiter system after a journey of several years.", "title": "NASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper' \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper", "source": "https://europa.nasa.gov/news/2/nasa-mission-named-europa-clipper/"}, {"document_id": "61a453a165405075-4701-6959", "score": 0.9315887093544001, "text": "FAQ | Mission \u2013 NASA's Europa Clipper\nEuropa orbits Jupiter at about 417,000 miles (671,000 kilometers) from the planet, which itself orbits the Sun at a distance of roughly 500 million miles (780 million kilometers), or 5.2 astronomical units (AU).

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-3166-5282", "score": 0.984107553958892, "text": "\nIt is accessed with an HTTP API and can therefore be accessed by any device on the internet that speaks HTTP: application code, web browser, IoT device, or mobile phone.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10165-5520-7943", "score": 0.9807848334312431, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant is a modern NoSQL database that is useful for many data-driven use cases: from key-value to complex document-oriented data storage and query.

Now the model is immutable. To add an order, I create a new order document in the database, which cannot generate conflicts.\n\nTo be able to retrieve all orders for a specific customer, we can employ a view, which we cover later.\n\nAvoid constructs that rely on updates to parts of existing documents, where possible. Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB.

On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you\u2019re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-data-modeling"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00558-23465-25360", "score": 0.9942709207534791, "text": "\nIBM Cloudant JSON documents and requests have the following maximum size limits:\n\n\n\nTable 4.

Now the model is immutable. To add an order, I create a new order document in the database, which cannot generate conflicts.\n\nTo be able to retrieve all orders for a specific customer, we can employ a view, which we cover later.\n\nAvoid constructs that rely on updates to parts of existing documents, where possible.

On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It\u2019s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size.

You can use a json or text type of index with IBM Cloudant.\n\nIn the following cases, you can specify how the index is created by making it of type json:\n\n\n\n* You know exactly what data you want to look for.\n* You want to keep storage and processing requirements to a minimum.\n\n\n\nBut for maximum flexibility when you search for data, you typically create an index of type text. Indexes of type text have a simple mechanism for automatically indexing all the fields in the documents.\n\nWhile more flexible, text indexes might take longer to create and require more storage resources than json indexes.\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nYou can create an index with one of the following types:\n\n\n\n* \"type\": \"json\"\n* \"type\": \"text\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a type=json index \n\nTo create a JSON index in the database $DATABASE, make a POST request to /$DATABASE/_index with a JSON object that describes the index in the request body. The type field of the JSON object must be set to json. A JSON index can be partitioned or global; this option is set by using the partitioned field.\n\nSee the following example that uses HTTP to request an index of type JSON:\n\nPOST /$DATABASE/_index HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a partitioned index that is called foo-partitioned-index for the field called foo:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"foo\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"foo-partitioned-index\",\n\"type\" : \"json\",\n\"partitioned\": true\n}\n\nSee the following example of a JSON object that creates a global index that is called bar-global-index for the field called bar:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"bar\"]\n},\n\"name\" : \"bar-global-index\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-37889-39953", "score": 0.9901007413864131, "text": "\nIf you need to access objects within documents, you can use standard dot notation for example, address.zipcode to access a postal code string inside an address object.\n\nWe can also add the following parameters:\n\nFields\n: Specifies the document attributes that we want returned (the default is the entire document).\n\nSort\n: Defines how the data is to be sorted. Sort is an array, allowing the sort to be calculated on multiple attributes.\n\nLimit\n: The number of documents to return.\n\nIf you are from a relational database background, this query is the equivalent SQL query to that last IBM Cloudant query example.\n\nThe WHERE clause is the equivalent of SELECTOR in IBM Cloudant Query. ORDER and LIMIT are exactly equivalent, and the IBM Cloudant Query FIELDS list is equivalent to the comma-separated list of attributes after the SELECT keyword.\n\nThe JSON syntax might take a bit of getting used to, but MongoDB users might find it familiar.\n\nIBM Cloudant queries can be executed in the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. Select the database that you are working with, for example, books then choose the Query tab.\n\nEnter your IBM Cloudant Query JSON in the box that is provided, and click Run Query when you're ready. The result set appears on the page.\n\nThe Explain button is used to provide an explanation on how the database interprets the supplied query. This explanation becomes more important when we get to Indexing in the next part.\n\nQueries can be triggered from curl too. The Query JSON, in this case, is stored in a file and we POST to the _find endpoint by using the -d@ command-line syntax.\n\nThe Node.js code is similar. The Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

Every _find response contains a bookmark - a token that IBM Cloudant uses to determine where to resume from when later queries are made. To get the next set of query results, add the bookmark that was received in the previous response to your next request. Remember to keep the selector the same, otherwise you receive unexpected results. To paginate backwards, you can use a previous bookmark to return the previous set of results.\n\nThe presence of a bookmark doesn\u2019t guarantee more results.

If two or more JSON type indexes match, the index with the smallest number of fields in the index is preferred.

Luck doesn't predict the success of a business, but neither does hard work.  I started 3 businesses in the past 2 years and they are all making money.  I also put a ton of research into each one and carefully planned out a business strategy.

The LOWEST amount a seller would accept is the liquidation value. For a B&B, what would the value of the land, the house, the furnishings, accounts payable, etc. be if it had to be sold today, minus any liabilities.  The amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings. One example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis. You determine the EBITDA, the earnings a company generated, before interest,  depreciation, taxation and amortization.  Once you have this amount, you can project it out in perpetuity, or you use an industry multiplier.  Perpetuity:  You project this value out in perpituity, discounted by the going interest rate. In other words, if you project the business will earn $100,000/year, the business should grow at a 5% rate, and the going interest rate is 8%. Using a growing perpetuity formula, one value of a business would be: 100,000 / (.08 - .03) = $2,000,000.  This is a very high number, and the seller would love to get it.  It's more common to do a multiple of the EBIDTA. You can do some research into the valuation of the particular industry to figure out the EBIDTA multiplier for the industry. For example, this article suggests that the 2011 EBITDA multiplier for hospitality industries is 13.8. (It's valuing large hotel chains, but it's a start). So the value of this B&B would be around $1,380,000. Here is an online SME valuation tool to help with the EBIDTA multiple based valuation. Also, from my research, it looks like many small business use Seller Discretionary Earnings  (SDE) instead of EBITDA. I don't know much about it, but it seems to serve a similar purpose as EBITDA.  A potential buyer should request the financial statements of the business for the last few years to determine the value of the business, and then can negotiate with the owner a price.

Having worked with other people attempting to get the business launched, I can shed a bit of insight. The primary reason for the pricing is that there simply isn't enough competition to warrant dropping the price any lower than it already is. Large companies such as Hallmark will typically buy card designs at 5% of the card's selling price. With their existing distribution network, this makes bringing in new and varied designs much easier for large companies that are already well established. Having talked with such designers in the past, someone working full time producing designs makes on average 30-60k annually from this, which is worth it to someone who doesn't want to jump through the hoops of actually getting into the business independently. The primary issue stifling competition is actually getting your product into stores. There are topics here that I cannot discuss due to NDA, but I can break down the overall outline for you: You need to start with a large number of designs, with enough variety that companies think could sell well. If you bring a handful of designs with you, no company is going to take your business venture seriously enough. You need to find a company that can stamp out a large production process for you. The company is going to need to be nice enough to take smaller purchase orders on the magnitude of several hundred cards, but also be capable of scaling that production to several hundreds of thousands of cards very quickly. For cards specifically, most companies want you to ship custom racks with your cards. Some companies may provide their own racks for stocking your product, but not all of them will. This will also cost a lot of money up front. You need to find a buyer for a company you want to sell your product to. This is important, and what killed our original business plans. Think Wal-Mart, Target, or even CVS Pharmacy. These big companies are going to have people who's entire job is to buy new products to put on their shelves. This is where networking is key, you need to find people with connections to these buyers if you're not already well established with them.

Salary: The obvious one, what they pay you. Taxes: There are several taxes that an employer has to pay for the privilege of hiring someone, including social security taxes (which goes to your retirement), unemployment insurance tax (your unemployment benefits if they lay you off), and workers compensation tax (pays if you are injured on the job). (There may be other taxes that I'm not thinking of, but in any case those are the main ones.) Benefits: In the U.S. employers often pay for medical insurance, sometimes for dental, life, and disability. There's usually some sort of retirement plan. They expect to give you some number of vacation days, holidays, and sick days where they pay you even though you're not working. Companies sometimes offer other benefits, like discounts on buying company products, membership in health clubs, etc. Capital: Often the company has to provide you with some sort of equipment, like a computer; furniture, like a chair and desk; etc. As far as the company is concerned, all of the above are part of the cost of having you as an employee. If they would pay a domestic employee $60,000 in salary and $20,000 in taxes, then assuming the same benefits and capital investment, if a foreign employee would cost them $0 in taxes they should logically be willing to pay $80,000. Any big company will have accountants who figure out the total cost of a new employee in excruciating detail, and they will likely be totally rational about this. A smaller company might think, \"\"well, taxes don't really count ...\"\" This is irrational but people are not always rational. I don't know what benefits they are offering you, if any, and what equipment they will provide you with, if any. I also don't know what taxes, if any, a U.S. company has to pay when hiring a remote employee in a foreign country. If anybody on here knows the answer to that, please chime in.

Simply stated, money now is worth more than money later, because of what you can do with money between now and later. Case in point: let's say the par value of a bond is $100, and will mature 10 years from this date (these are common terms for most bonds, though the U.S. Treasury has a variety of bonds with varying par values and maturation periods), with a 0% coupon rate (nothing's paid out prior to maturity). If the company or government issuing the bonds needs one million dollars, and the people buying the bonds are expecting a 5% rate of return on their investment, then each bond would only sell for about $62, and the bond issuer would have to sell a par value of $1.62 million in bonds to get its $1m now. These numbers are based on equations that calculate the \"\"future value\"\" of an investment made now, and conversely the \"\"present value\"\" of a future return. Back to that time value of money concept, money now (that you're paying to buy the bond) is worth more than money later (that you'll get back at maturity), so you will expect to be returned more than you invested to account for this time difference. The percentage of rate of return is known as the \"\"yield\"\" or the \"\"discount rate\"\" depending on what you're calculating, what else you take into consideration when defining the rate (like inflation), and whom you talk to. Now, that $1.62m in par value may be hard for the bond issuer to swallow. The issuer is effectively paying interest on interest over the lifetime of the bond. Instead, many issuers choose to issue \"\"coupon bonds\"\", which have a \"\"coupon rate\"\" determining the amount of a \"\"coupon payment\"\".

If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will present your oral argument.

All oral arguments in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription service and pay them a separate fee.\n \n What does the court think if I do not make an oral argument? If you decide not to make an oral argument, the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t care about the appeal.

These guidelines were all developed based on the risk characteristics of the various asset categories. Bonds are ultra-low-risk, large caps are low-risk (you don't see most big stocks like Coca-Cola going anywhere soon), foreign stocks are medium-risk (subject to additional political risk and currency risk, especially so in developing markets) and small-caps are higher risk (more to gain, but more likely to go out of business).  Moreover, the risks of different asset classes tend to balance each other out some. When stocks fall, bonds typically rise (the recent credit crunch being a notable but temporary exception) as people flock to safety or as the Fed adjusts interest rates. When stocks soar, bonds don't look as attractive, and interest rates may rise (a bummer when you already own the bonds). Is the US economy stumbling with the dollar in the dumps, while the rest of the world passes us by? Your foreign holdings will be worth more in dollar terms. If you'd like to work alternative asset classes (real estate, gold and other commodities, etc) into your mix, consider their risk characteristics, and what will make them go up and down. A good asset allocation should limit the amount of 'down' that can happen all at once; the more conservative the allocation needs to be, the less 'down' is possible (at the expense of the 'up'). .... As for what risks you are willing to take, that will depend on your position in life, and what risks you are presently are exposed to (including: your job, how stable your company is and whether it could fold or do layoffs in a recession like this one, whether you're married, whether you have kids, where you live).

The economics of the firms in particular are not explored in this answer as it would get too complicated and long if I did.) Political risk relates not only to the problems surrounding international politics such as a country deciding that foreign nationals may no longer own shares in their national industries or deciding to seize foreign nationals' assets as happens in some areas. Your home country may also decide to apply sanctions to the country in which you are invested thus making it impossible to get your money back even though the foreign country will allow you to redeem them or sell. Diplomatic relations and trade agreements tend to be difficult. There are further problems in lack of understanding of foreign countries' laws, tax code, customs etc. relating to investments and the necessity to find legal representation in a country you may never have visited if there are issues. There is also a hidden risk in that, as an individual investor, you are not likely to be reading the local financial news for that country regularly enough to spot company specific issues arising.

For example, German bonds have been considered safer than Greek bonds recently based on the underlying strength of the government. Unlike Cash Equivalents, these are not guaranteed against loss, which means that if the issuer defaults, you could lose up to 100% of your investment. Bonds have several new features you will need to consider. One is interest rate risk. One reason bonds perform better than cash equivalents is that you are taking on the risk that if interest rates rise, the fixed payments the bond promises will be worth less, and the face value of your bond will fall. While most bonds are still very Liquid, this means that if you need to sell the bond before it matures, you could lose money. As mentioned earlier, some bonds are riskier than others. Given that you are looking for a low-risk investment, you would want to select a bond that is considered \"\"invesment grade\"\" rather than a riskier \"\"junk\"\" bond. Debt investments are a good choice if you can afford to do without this money for a few years, and you want to balance safety with somewhat better returns than Cash Equivalents. Again though, I would not recommend investing in Debt until you have also built up a separate Emergency Fund. If you do choose to invest in bonds, I recommend that you diversify your risks by investing in a bond fund, rather than in just one company's or government's debt.

A particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends, which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders (the other way is simply by increasing the company's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors).

While it is true that, on average over a sufficiently long period of time, stocks do have a high expected return, it is important to realize that bonds are a different type of financial instrument that stocks, and have features that are attractive to certain types of investors. The purpose of buying bonds is to convert a lump sum of currency into a series of future cash flows. This is in and of itself valuable to the issuer because they would prefer to have the lump sum today, rather than at some point in the future. So we generally don't say that we've \"\"lost\"\" the money, we say that we are purchasing a series of future payments, and we would only do this if it were more valuable to us than having the money in hand. Unlike stocks, where you are compensated with dividends and equity to take on the risks and rewards of ownership, and unlike a savings account (which is much different that a bond), where you are only being paid interest for the time value of your money while the bank lends it out at their risk, when you buy a bond you are putting your money at risk in order to provide financing to the issuer. It is also important to realize that there is a much higher risk that stocks will lose value, and you have to compare the risk-adjusted return, and not the nominal return, for stocks to the risk-adjusted return for bonds, since with investment-grade bonds there is generally a very low risk of default. While the returns being offered may not seem attractive to you individually, it is not reasonable to say that the returns offered by the issuer are insufficient in general, because both when the bonds are issued and then subsequently traded on a secondary market (which is done fairly easily), they function as a market. That is to say that sellers always want a higher price (resulting in a lower return), and buyers always want to receive a higher return (requiring a lower price). So while some sellers and buyers will be able to agree on a mutually acceptable price (such that a transaction occurs), there will almost always be some buyers and sellers who also do not enter into transactions because they are demanding a lower/higher price. The fact that a market exists indicates that enough investors are willing to accept the returns that are being offered by sellers.", "title": "", "source": ""}, {"document_id": "122581-0-798", "score": 0.8015671372413631, "text": "\nBonds provide protections against stock market crashes, diversity and returns as the other posters have said but the primary reason to invest in bonds is to receive relatively guaranteed income.

Stocks don't guarantee income and shareholders are last in line to get paid.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16368-7-2072", "score": 0.9942736029624931, "text": "\nWeb chat development overview \n\nIf you are comfortable with JavaScript code, you can customize and extend the web chat by using the web chat API.

Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 0.992680728435516, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03422-4-2013", "score": 0.993459701538085, "text": "\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple. Its simplicity also means it can be misused. That's why it's important to verify that the messages sent to your assistant are coming from authorized users only.\n\nBefore you enable security, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Create a RS256 private/public key pair.\n\nYou can use a tool such as the OpenSSL command line or PuTTYgen.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16388-7-1918", "score": 0.992075324058532, "text": "\nEncrypting sensitive data \n\nBy using the public key that is provided by IBM, you can add another level of encryption to hide sensitive data you send from the web chat.\n\nTo use this method for encrypting data, you must first enable the web chat security feature. For more information, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).\n\nUse this method to send sensitive information in messages that come from your website, such as information about a customer's loyalty level, a user ID, or security tokens to use in webhooks that you call from actions. Information passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private context variable. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for a standard customer. You do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such, but you must pass this information to your action so it can change the flow of the conversation. To do this, you can pass the customer MVP status as an encrypted variable. This private context variable is available for use by the action, but not by anything else.\n\n![development icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/development-icon.png)Tutorial: For a tutorial that shows an example of using web chat security to authenticate users and protect sensitive data, see [Tutorial: Authenticating a user in the middle of a session](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-security).\n\nTo encrypt sensitive data:\n\n\n\n1.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-7-1700", "score": 0.989517509937286, "text": "\nHow the web chat works \n\nThe web chat provides an easy-to-use chatbot interface that you can add to your website without writing any code.\n\nAfter you add the web chat script to your website, your customers will see a launcher icon that they can click to open the chat window and start a conversation with the assistant.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03421-1518-3290", "score": 0.9960836768150331, "text": "\nIf you want to make more advanced customizations, you can make the following types of changes:\n\n\n\n* Change the launcher icon that is used to open the web chat widget.

No investment is, and when a major crash (c.f. 2008) occurs, all investments will be to some extent at risk. However, bonds add a level of diversification to your investment portfolio that can make it much more stable even during downturns. Bonds do not move identically to the stock market, and so many times investing in bonds will be more profitable when the stock market is slumping.  Investing some of your investment funds in bonds is safer, because that diversification allows you to have some earnings from that portion of your investment when the market is going down. It also allows you to do something called rebalancing.  This is when you have target allocation proportions for your portfolio; say 60% stock 40% bond.  Then, periodically look at your actual portfolio proportions.  Say the market is way up - then your actual proportions might be 70% stock 30% bond.  You sell 10 percentage points of stocks, and buy 10 percentage points of bonds. This over time will be a successful strategy, because it tends to buy low and sell high. In addition to the value of diversification, some bonds will tend to be more stable (but earn less), in particular blue chip corporate bonds and government bonds from stable countries.  If you're willing to only earn a few percent annually on a portion of your portfolio, that part will likely not fall much during downturns - and in fact may grow as money flees to safer investments - which in turn is good for you. If you're particularly worried about your portfolio's value in the short term, such as if you're looking at retiring soon, a decent proportion should be in this kind of safer bond to ensure it doesn't lose too much value.   But of course this will slow your earnings, so if you're still far from retirement, you're better off leaving things in growth stocks and accepting the risk; odds are no matter who's in charge, there will be another crash or two of some size before you retire if you're in your 30s now.

Although diversification is a good idea, for the individual investor it is far too complicated and incurs too much transaction costs, not to mention that rebalancing would have to be done on a regular basis. In your case where you have mutual funds already, it is probably a good idea to keep investing in mutual funds with a theme which you understand the industry's role in the economy today rather than investing in some special bonds which you cannot relate to.

For example, German bonds have been considered safer than Greek bonds recently based on the underlying strength of the government. Unlike Cash Equivalents, these are not guaranteed against loss, which means that if the issuer defaults, you could lose up to 100% of your investment. Bonds have several new features you will need to consider. One is interest rate risk. One reason bonds perform better than cash equivalents is that you are taking on the risk that if interest rates rise, the fixed payments the bond promises will be worth less, and the face value of your bond will fall. While most bonds are still very Liquid, this means that if you need to sell the bond before it matures, you could lose money. As mentioned earlier, some bonds are riskier than others. Given that you are looking for a low-risk investment, you would want to select a bond that is considered \"\"invesment grade\"\" rather than a riskier \"\"junk\"\" bond. Debt investments are a good choice if you can afford to do without this money for a few years, and you want to balance safety with somewhat better returns than Cash Equivalents. Again though, I would not recommend investing in Debt until you have also built up a separate Emergency Fund. If you do choose to invest in bonds, I recommend that you diversify your risks by investing in a bond fund, rather than in just one company's or government's debt. This will reduce the likelihood that you will experience a catastrophic loss. Ownership Ownership assets includes stocks and other assets such as real estate and precious metals such as gold. While these investments can have high returns, in your situation I would strongly recommend that you not invest in these types of investments, for the following reasons: For these reasons, debt is considered a safer investment than equity for any particular company, government, or the market as a whole.

Often times the assets they pitch have high fees.  These people won't charge you for their time because their time is a loss leader for the commissions they make on selling their products. In contrast a fiduciary's job responsibility is to look out for your interests.  They shouldn't receive any kind of payment based on what assets you buy.

Also known as orderer. These blocks are then distributed to peers, which then verify the blocks and add them to the ledgers on each channel. Ordering nodes contain the cryptographic identity material that is tied to each member and authenticate the identity of clients and peers to access the network.

After submitting a smart contract proposal, the originator can share the smart contract package and package id with other channel members in an out of band operation by emailing this information to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Peer \n\nA blockchain network resource that provides the services to execute and validate transactions, and maintain ledgers. The peer runs smart contract and is the holder of transaction history and the current state of assets on ledgers. They are owned and managed by organizations and are joined to channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n Propose \n\nReferring to a step in the Hyperledger Fabric v2.x smart contract lifecycle, a smart contract definition is proposed to a channel for approval by the organizations that are specified in the channel lifecycle endorsement policy. A smart contract proposal contains a smart contract definition name, version, package, endorsement policy, and optionally a private data collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quorum \n\nIn a Raft ordering service, a quorum represents the number of nodes that must be available for transactions to be processed. This number is a majority of the total number of nodes in the consenter set of the channel.

The console allows users to view, create, and manage their deployments. Because the public and private keys are only stored locally in the browser the console runs on, users maintain total control over their keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n Consortium \n\nThe group of non-orderer organizations listed on the orderer system channel. The following lines do not apply to orderers that do not use a system channel: These are the only organizations that can create channels. At channel creation time, all organizations added to the channel must be part of a consortium. However, an organization that is not defined in a consortium may be added to an existing channel.

Using CouchDB allows you to use rich queries and deploy indexes with your smart contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n Current state \n\nThe current state of the ledger represents the latest values for all keys that are ever included in its chain transaction log. Because current state represents all latest key values known to the channel, it is sometimes referred to as the world state. Smart contracts execute transaction proposals against current state data. The current state changes every time when the value of a key changes or a new key is added and is critical to a transaction flow because the latest key-value pair must be known before it can be changed. Peers commit the latest values to the current state of the ledger for each valid transaction in a block. The current state is stored the state database associated with a peer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dynamic membership \n\nA member can be dynamically added to the network by a user with registrar privilege. Members are also assigned roles and attributes, which control their access and authority on the network. Neither roles nor attributes can be assigned dynamically though. Hyperledger Fabric supports the addition or removal of members, peers, and ordering service nodes, without compromising the operations of the overall network.

Peers receive state updates in the form of new blocks from the ordering service. They then use the blocks and the world state to confirm (or commit) transactions, update the world state and add the log of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nOrdering nodes form a Raft ordering cluster that comprises the ordering service of a channel. The ordering service literally \u201corders\u201d transactions into blocks that are sent to peers to be committed to their ledgers. Each ordering node stores a copy of the blockchain portion of the channel ledger.\n\nChannels are the place where organizations interact within a network. You cannot participate in a blockchain network without joining a channel. Channels can be used by members of the network to create logical separation between business applications and even to boost performance by limiting traffic. They can also be used by subsets of organizations in the consortium to transact privately and separate data.\n\nPeers maintain a separate ledger for each channel that they join. Only organizations that are members of the channel can join their peers to the channel and receive ledger updates from the ordering service. As a result, each channel is bound to an ordering service, which stores the blockchain portion of every channel ledger that it maintains. Client applications submit transactions to the peers and ordering service of a given channel.

In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. A hydrogen cell of this type, in contrast, would start with the water and use electricity to turn it back into hydrogen and oxygen. The two devices, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, are nearly identical devices, operated in a very different way.\nUsing water to make oxygen on Mars would be a great idea if we had easy access to the water. But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars", "source": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-5670-7525", "score": 0.9822228550910951, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThat destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called \u2013 coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there \u2013 on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL).

ISRU is another acronym, In Situ Resource Utilization, which is a technical way of describing what most of us call \"living off the land.\"\nThe word \"moxie,\" used to describe someone with spunk and audacity, came from the soft drink of the same name. The soft drink, Moxie, was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works. You can still buy Moxie in New England, and it's considered the official drink of the state of Maine.\nThe connection with soft drinks doesn't end there. According to some accounts, the Moxie company was the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy. On Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make \u2013 well, anything at all. Another connection is more technical. Whenever we run MOXIE, we need to be very careful with the settings to make sure we only produce carbon monoxide (CO), and not pure carbon, which would ruin it. That destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called \u2013 coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin.

When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours. The rover batteries have enough available charge left to make oxygen for about an hour after that. During that hour, we sometimes change the voltage or the compressor speed to learn more about the instrument.\nWhen MOXIE runs, very little else gets done on Perseverance. There isn't enough power left to drive, or to abrade rocks, or even to run the other instruments for very long. So MOXIE doesn't run very often, maybe once every one or two months.\n\nWhat do we hope to learn from MOXIE?\n\nMOXIE's main job is to show that we can rely on this technology to keep future crews of astronauts alive and return them home safely. That's a tall order. But more than that, we hope to learn a lot of technical details about how to build that much larger future MOXIE system. For that purpose, we include in MOXIE lots of sensors and controls that help us learn about how well MOXIE is doing and how to make it better.\n\nWhat would a full-size MOXIE look like?\n\nEarth and Mars line up for a trip every 26 months.

The Perseverance power system only provides about 100 watts, so MOXIE can only make a small fraction of the oxygen that a future \"Big MOXIE\" would need to make.\n\nMOXIE is a 'Tech Demo'\nNASA uses technical demonstrations, or tech demos, when it's not enough to just test a critical technology in the laboratory and it needs to be proven on an actual mission.\n\nWhere Is MOXIE Located?\n\nMichael Hecht\nPrincipal Investigator\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\nDid You Know?\nMOXIE uses a device called an \"electrolyzer\" to make oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the air.

In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there \u2013 on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product.

ISRU is another acronym, In Situ Resource Utilization, which is a technical way of describing what most of us call \"living off the land.\"\nThe word \"moxie,\" used to describe someone with spunk and audacity, came from the soft drink of the same name. The soft drink, Moxie, was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works. You can still buy Moxie in New England, and it's considered the official drink of the state of Maine.\nThe connection with soft drinks doesn't end there. According to some accounts, the Moxie company was the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy. On Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make \u2013 well, anything at all. Another connection is more technical. Whenever we run MOXIE, we need to be very careful with the settings to make sure we only produce carbon monoxide (CO), and not pure carbon, which would ruin it. That destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called \u2013 coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin.

When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours. The rover batteries have enough available charge left to make oxygen for about an hour after that. During that hour, we sometimes change the voltage or the compressor speed to learn more about the instrument.\nWhen MOXIE runs, very little else gets done on Perseverance. There isn't enough power left to drive, or to abrade rocks, or even to run the other instruments for very long. So MOXIE doesn't run very often, maybe once every one or two months.\n\nWhat do we hope to learn from MOXIE?\n\nMOXIE's main job is to show that we can rely on this technology to keep future crews of astronauts alive and return them home safely. That's a tall order. But more than that, we hope to learn a lot of technical details about how to build that much larger future MOXIE system. For that purpose, we include in MOXIE lots of sensors and controls that help us learn about how well MOXIE is doing and how to make it better.\n\nWhat would a full-size MOXIE look like?\n\nEarth and Mars line up for a trip every 26 months. When we send an astronaut crew to Mars, one idea is to send all the things they'll need \u2013 a place to live, rovers, a power plant, and maybe a \"Big MOXIE\" \u2013 on one launch opportunity, then send the astronauts on the next opportunity, 26 months later. If we do that, then the base would be in place for about 20 months before the astronauts start their trip. The goal of a Big MOXIE would be to make and store all the oxygen that the astronaut and their rocket would need for their mission before they even launch. That means the Big MOXIE would need to make 2,000 to 3,000 grams of oxygen per hour, compared to the 6-10 grams that the current MOXIE is making.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars", "source": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-7099-9072", "score": 0.23976568877696902, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nAnother example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse.

But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit.

Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15151-0-569", "score": 0.031555917114019005, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Configuring security groups \n\nThe Virtual Network Function (VNF) data network interface is attached to a VPC security group.

When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours. The rover batteries have enough available charge left to make oxygen for about an hour after that. During that hour, we sometimes change the voltage or the compressor speed to learn more about the instrument.\nWhen MOXIE runs, very little else gets done on Perseverance. There isn't enough power left to drive, or to abrade rocks, or even to run the other instruments for very long. So MOXIE doesn't run very often, maybe once every one or two months.\n\nWhat do we hope to learn from MOXIE?\n\nMOXIE's main job is to show that we can rely on this technology to keep future crews of astronauts alive and return them home safely. That's a tall order. But more than that, we hope to learn a lot of technical details about how to build that much larger future MOXIE system.

If we do that, then the base would be in place for about 20 months before the astronauts start their trip. The goal of a Big MOXIE would be to make and store all the oxygen that the astronaut and their rocket would need for their mission before they even launch.

MOXIE will test a way for future explorers to produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere for burning fuel and breathing.\nTech Specs\n\nMain Job\nTo produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere\n\nLocation\nInside the rover (front, right side)\n\nMass\nAbout 37.7 pounds (17.1 kilograms) on Earth\n\nWeight", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars", "source": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-7099-9072", "score": 0.960210025310516, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nAnother example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. A hydrogen cell of this type, in contrast, would start with the water and use electricity to turn it back into hydrogen and oxygen. The two devices, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, are nearly identical devices, operated in a very different way.\nUsing water to make oxygen on Mars would be a great idea if we had easy access to the water. But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars", "source": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-2585-4611", "score": 0.9583551287651061, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using \u2014 whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank. The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'\nFuel needs oxygen to burn\u2014for example, on Earth, oxygen is constantly being converted to carbon dioxide by animals, or fires, or other chemical reactions. Plants and trees use water and sunlight to convert the carbon dioxide back to oxygen, replenishing the air. On Mars, MOXIE also makes oxygen from carbon dioxide, about as much as a modest-sized tree, though using a very different process.\n\nMOXIE is a Scale Model for a Future Big MOXIE\nTo launch from Mars, a small crew of human explorers will need 25 to 30 tons of oxygen, or about the weight of a tractor-trailer! To make that much oxygen would require a 25,000 to 30,000 watt power plant. The Perseverance power system only provides about 100 watts, so MOXIE can only make a small fraction of the oxygen that a future \"Big MOXIE\" would need to make.\n\nMOXIE is a 'Tech Demo'\nNASA uses technical demonstrations, or tech demos, when it's not enough to just test a critical technology in the laboratory and it needs to be proven on an actual mission.\n\nWhere Is MOXIE Located?\n\nMichael Hecht\nPrincipal Investigator\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\nDid You Know?\nMOXIE uses a device called an \"electrolyzer\" to make oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the air.

In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there \u2013 on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars", "source": "https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/moxie/"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-2585-4611", "score": 0.003116810927167, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using \u2014 whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank.

When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours. The rover batteries have enough available charge left to make oxygen for about an hour after that. During that hour, we sometimes change the voltage or the compressor speed to learn more about the instrument.\nWhen MOXIE runs, very little else gets done on Perseverance. There isn't enough power left to drive, or to abrade rocks, or even to run the other instruments for very long. So MOXIE doesn't run very often, maybe once every one or two months.\n\nWhat do we hope to learn from MOXIE?\n\nMOXIE's main job is to show that we can rely on this technology to keep future crews of astronauts alive and return them home safely. That's a tall order. But more than that, we hope to learn a lot of technical details about how to build that much larger future MOXIE system.

The Discovery Program required NASA centers and university-based scientists to submit proposals to competitions that were to be held every few years. To get the program going, the first two Discovery missions were assigned. JPL was awarded Mars Pathfinder. The Mars Pathfinder mission introduced what has become a powerful technology for planetary exploration: the planetary rover. The USSR had landed robotic rovers on the Moon, and it had tried to land a miniature rover on Mars in the 1970s but had failed. Mars Pathfinder's micro-rover, named Sojourner, for abolitionist Sojourner Truth, in 1997 became the first robotic rover to explore the Red Planet.

For more than half a century, NASA's fleet of increasingly sophisticated orbiters, landers, and rovers has helped us transform science fiction into reality, enabling us to piece together detailed information about Mars, our nearest planetary neighbor. These robotic explorers have revealed details of the Red Planet\u2019s diverse surface, atmosphere, and weather, the presence of water in its past, and its potential for life through the ages and for astronauts in the future.JPL has played a pivotal role in this exploration, starting when the first successful spacecraft, Mariner 4, completed the first Mars flyby in 1965, and in 1976, when two Viking landers successfully touched down on the Martian surface. The era of Mars rovers opened when Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner rover successfully landed in 1997. In fact, JPL designed, built, and operated all five of the successful Mars rovers. Since 1997, JPL-managed spacecraft have been exploring continuously on the ground and in the skies above Mars.What We Learn By Exploring MarsThat reddish planet in our nighttime skies has long intrigued brilliant science fiction writers and enthusiasts. Fortunately, Mars has also attracted great science and technology minds, including many at JPL who help us address tantalizing questions through an ongoing, focused series of Mars missions.Those missions have already revealed strong evidence that some areas once had conditions suitable for life.

Leave a Lasting Legacy: Foundations set up in perpetuity can burnish your name far beyond your lifetime. Because gifts are made from an endowment that generates investment revenue, the total gifts made by the foundation can far surpass the actual funding. Be Taken More Seriously as a Philanthropist: A foundation imparts a gravitas that causes people to take your philanthropy more seriously, due to the structured, organized approach you employ for your giving. Sidestep Unsolicited Requests: When you focus your foundation on specific giving areas, your mission statement can be used to politely turn down off-target funding requests. Deepen and Focus Your Philanthropy: Whereas individual donors often spread their giving among as many causes as possible, the formalized structure of a foundation often encourages donors to narrow their focus to specific causes. Build a Better Family: As family members take on philanthropic research, present their findings to the board, participate in the decision-making process, and track results, they hone skills that will serve them for years to come. Tax-Deductible Grants to Individuals in Need: A private foundation allows you to provide emergency assistance directly to individuals using dollars for which you\u2019ve already received a tax deduction. Run Charitable Programs Without Setting Up a Separate Nonprofit: Direct charitable activities are IRS-approved programs that permit foundations to directly fund and carry out their own projects.

Ask yourself three questions: Whom do you want to inherit your assets? Whom do you want handling your financial affairs if you're ever incapacitated? Whom do you want making medical decisions for you if you become unable to make them for yourself? **4. Everybody needs a will.** A will tells the world exactly where you want your assets distributed when you die. It's also the best place to name guardians for your children. Dying without a will -- also known as dying \"\"intestate\"\" -- can be costly to your heirs and leaves you no say over who gets your assets. Even if you have a trust, you still need a will to take care of any holdings outside of that trust when you die. **5.

Estate planning - typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses. Guardians are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in incapacity. In general, your \"\"estate\"\" includes all of your assets, less all debt, plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust. The biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or incapacity prevents you from acting for yourself. In addition, tax minimization is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates. To create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan, you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney. When you consult with an estate planning attorney, the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs, what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are tax-minimization strategies that would be appropriate and appealing; what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of incapacity; and any complicating family issues. To deal with these issues, your attorney will need full and accurate information about you, including: When an estate plan is created, be sure you understand what the attorney is saying.

Plus, it defers the tough decisions about the distribution of your assets until your spouse's death. **9.

You may also pay an unlimited amount of medical and education bills for someone if you pay the expenses directly to the institutions where they were incurred. **10.

In practice, I don't know if this happens as I am not a lawyer. I have found it difficult to find witnesses who will sign a form will, and it is disconcerting to have to ask friends or coworkers for this sort of favor as most people learn never to sign anything without reading it. But a lawyer often has secretaries that do it... There is a procedure and a treaty for international wills, which I know about from living overseas. To streamline things, you can get the witnesses to each sign an affidavit after they signed the will. The affidavit is sworn written testimony of what happened, that they saw the person sign their will and sign in each others' presence, when, where, no duress, etc. If done correctly, this can be sufficient to prove the will without calling on witnesses.

Estate planning - typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses. Guardians are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in incapacity. In general, your \"\"estate\"\" includes all of your assets, less all debt, plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust. The biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or incapacity prevents you from acting for yourself. In addition, tax minimization is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates. To create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan, you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney. When you consult with an estate planning attorney, the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs, what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are tax-minimization strategies that would be appropriate and appealing; what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of incapacity; and any complicating family issues. To deal with these issues, your attorney will need full and accurate information about you, including: When an estate plan is created, be sure you understand what the attorney is saying.

Dying without a will -- also known as dying \"\"intestate\"\" -- can be costly to your heirs and leaves you no say over who gets your assets. Even if you have a trust, you still need a will to take care of any holdings outside of that trust when you die. **5. Trusts aren't just for the wealthy.** Trusts are legal mechanisms that let you put conditions on how and when your assets will be distributed upon your death. They also allow you to reduce your estate and gift taxes and to distribute assets to your heirs without the cost, delay and publicity of probate court, which administers wills. Some also offer greater protection of your assets from creditors and lawsuits. **6.", "title": "", "source": ""}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "Can capital expenses for volunteer purposes be deducted from income?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "fd309ff8-8b41-49a0-b483-2fee97472e71", "created_at": 1723466949}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "Indeed you can't deduct the value of your time or services, including the  value of income lost while you work as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization.

If you are buying ETFs, there is going to be so much volume on the market that your small trade is going to have no impact on the price. You should just place a market order.

If you place an order for 100 shares, the sellers willing to sell 100 shares at the lowest price will be matched with your order (sometimes you may get 50 shares at one price and 50 shares at a slightly different price).    If your stock has a lot of volatility and you place a market order for a small amount of shares,  you will get the best price.

If you are simply trading stocks you will not lose more than you put in, unless you are trading on margin. A limit order is basically that, a limit on the maximum price you want your buy order bought at or the minimum price you want your sell order sold at. If you can't be glued to the screen all day when you place a limit order, and the market moves the opposite way, you may miss out on your order being executed. Even if you can be in front of the screen all day, you then have to decide if you want to chase the market of miss out on your purchase or sale. For example, if a stock is trading at $10.10 and you put a limit buy order to buy 1000 shares at or below $10.00 and the price keeps moving up to $10.20, then $10.30 and then $10.50, until it closes the day at $11.00. You then have the choice during the day to miss out on buying the shares or to increase your limit order in order to buy at a higher price. Sometime if the stock is not very liquid, i.e. it does not trade very often and has low volume, the price may hit $10.00 and you may only have part of your order executed, say 500 out of your 1000 shares were bought. This may mean that you may have to increase the price of your remaining order or be happy with only buying 500 shares instead of 1000. The same can happen when you are selling (but in reverse obviously). With market order, however, you are placing a buy order to buy at the next bid price in the depth or a sell order to sell at the next offer price in the depth. See the market depth table below: Note that this price depth table is taken before market open so it seems that the stock is somewhat illiquid with a large gap between the first and second prices in the buyers (bid) prices.

This is because the liquidity is much lower during pre-market and post-market, and using market orders could result in some trades filling at horrible prices.  So brokers don't allow using market orders outside of regular trading hours. Third, some brokers require you to specify that you want your order to be executed during pre-market or post-market.

Finally, if your broker allows pre/post market trading, and you place a limit order while specifying \"\"Ext\"\", then your trade can happen in real-time during pre-market or post-market.

Though several responses have mentioned the inherent risks that currency speculation, leverage, and frequent trading of stocks or currencies bring about, more information, and possibly a combination of answers, is necessary to fully answer this question. My answer should probably not be the answer, just some additional information to help aid your (and others') decision(s). Firstly, as a retail investor, don't trade forex. Period. Major currency pairs arguably make up the most efficient market in the world, and as a layman, that puts you at a severe disadvantage. You mentioned you were a student\u2014since you have something else to do other than trade currencies, implicitly you cannot spend all of your time researching, monitoring, and investigating the various (infinite) drivers of currency return. Since major financial institutions such as banks, broker-dealers, hedge-funds, brokerages, inter-dealer-brokers, mutual funds, ETF companies, etc..., do have highly intelligent people researching, monitoring, and investigating the various drivers of currency return at all times, you're unlikely to win against the opposing trader. Not impossible to win, just improbable; over time, that probability will rob you clean. Secondly, investing in individual businesses can be a worthwhile endeavor and, especially as a young student, one that could pay dividends (pun intended!) for a very long time. That being said, what I mentioned above also holds true for many large-capitalization equities\u2014there are thousands, maybe millions, of very intelligent people who do nothing other than research a few individual stocks and are often paid quite handsomely to do so. As with forex, you will often be at a severe informational disadvantage when trading. So, view any purchase of a stock as a very long-term commitment\u2014at least five years. And if you're going to invest in a stock, you must review the company's financial history\u2014that means poring through 10-K/Q for several years (I typically examine a minimum ten years of financial statements) and reading the notes to the financial statements.", "title": "", "source": ""}, {"document_id": "541152-0-422", "score": 0.897415935993194, "text": "\nI would also consider unnecessarily complex investment strategies a big warning sign as they can easily hide poor investment advice or a bad strategy.

Long-term *retail* investors look for *orderly markets*, the antithesis of HFT business models, which have a direct correlation between market volatility and profits. To a lesser extent, some \"\"dumb money\"\"/\"\"muppet\"\" institutionals do as well. HFT firms tout they supply liquidity into markets, when in fact the opposite is true.  Yes, HFTs supply liquidity, *but only when the liquidity's benefits runs in their direction*. That is, they are applying the part of the liquidity definition that mentions \"\"high trading activity\"\", and conveniently ignoring the part that simultaneously requires \"\"*easily* buying *or* selling an asset\"\".  If HFT's are the new exchange floor, then they need to be formalized as such, *and become bound to market maker responsibilities*. If they are actually supplying liquidity, like real Designated Market Makers in the NYSE for example, they become responsible to supply a specified liquidity for specified ticker symbols in exchange for their informational advantage on those tickers. The indisputable fact is that HFT cannot exist at their current profit levels without the information advantage they gain with preferential access to tick-by-tick data unavailable to investors who cannot afford the exchange fees ($1M per exchange 10 years ago, more now). Restrict the entire market, including HFTs, to only second-by-second price data without the tick-by-tick depth, and they won't do so well.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking HFTs *per se*; I think they are a marvelous development, so long as they really do \"\"supply liquidity\"\". Right now, they aren't doing so, and especially in an orderly manner. If you want retail investors to keep out of the water as they are doing now, by all means let HFT (and regulatory capture, and a whole host of other financial service industry ills) run as they are. There are arguments to be made about \"\"only let the professionals play the market\"\", where there is no role for retail and anyone who doesn't know how to play the long-term investment game needs to get out of the kitchen.

This includes the mutual funds you mentioned, and even most index funds (most are so narrowly focused they lose their relevance for the retail investor).  In the retail investment markets I'm familiar with, there are market makers of some sort or another for specified ranges. I'm perfectly fine with no market makers; but retail investors should be told the naked truth as well, and not sold a bunch of come-ons. What upsets me is seeing that just as computers really start to make an orderly market possible (you are right, the classic NYSE specialist structure was outrageously corrupt), regulators turned a blind eye to implementing better controls for retail investors.  The financial services industry has to come to terms whether they want AUM from retail or not, and having heard messaging much like yours from other professionals, I've concluded that the industry does *not* want the constraints with accepting those funds, but neither do they want to disabuse retail investors of how tilted the game is against them. Luring them in with deceptively suggestive marketing and then taking money from those naturally ill-prepared for the rigors of the setting is like beating up the Downs' Syndrome kid on the short bus and boasting about it back on the campus about how clever and strong one is. If there was as stringent truth in marketing in financial services as cigarettes, like \"\"this service makes their profit by encouraging the churning of trades\"\", there would be a lot of kvetching from so-called \"\"pros\"\" as well. If all retail financial services were described like \"\"dead cold cow meat\"\" describes \"\"steak\"\", a lot of retail investors would be better off. As it stands today, you'd have to squint mighty hard to see the faintly-inscribed \"\"caveat emptor\"\" on financial services offerings to the retail sector.  Note that depending upon the market setting, the definition of retail differs.

My suggestion would be to open an account with a discount brokerage (Schwab, Fidelity, eTrade, etc). The advantage of a brokerage IRA is that you can invest in whatever you want within the account. Then, either buy an S&P 500 or total market index fund within the account, or buy an index-based ETF (like a mutual fund, but trades like a stock). The latter might be better, since many mutual funds have minimum limits, which ETFs do not. Set the account up to reinvest the dividends automatically--S&P 500 yields will far outstrip current savings account yields--and sit back and do nothing for the next 40 or 50 years. Well, except for continuing to make annual contributions to the account, which you should continue to invest in pretty much the same thing until you have enough money (and experience and knowledge) to diversify into bond funds/international funds/individual stocks, etc. Disclaimer: I am not a financial planner.

In short, the glory days of rags to riches by day trading are long gone, if they were ever here in the first place.  Edit: the site will not allow me to add a comment, so I am putting my response here: Possibly, yes. One big 'gotcha' is that your broker reports the proceeds from your sales, but does not report your outflows from your buys. Then there is the risk you take by the broker refusing to sell the security until the transaction settles. Not to mention wash sale rules. You are trying to win at the 'buy low, sell high' game. But you have a 25% chance, at best, of winning at that game. Can you pick the low? Maybe, but you have a 50% chance of being right. Then you have to pick the high. And again you have a 50% chance of doing that. 50% times 50% is 25%. Warren Buffet did not get rich that way. Buffet buys and holds. Don't be a speculator, be a 'buy and hold' investor.

So instead, I'd approach it as \"\"How much of this cash do I need over the next 5 years?\"\" That is, sum up $X for the car, $Y for fun & travel, $Z for emergencies, etc. Keep that amount as cash for now. Beyond that, I'd put the balance in your brokerage and get it working hard for you now. (I don't think an average of a 3% div yield is too hard to achieve even when picking a safe, conservative portfolio. Though you do run the risk of capital losses if invested.) Once your total portfolio (TSP + brokerage) is $100k* or more, then consider pulling the trigger on a second passive income stream by splitting off some of your brokerage balance. Until then, keep learning what you can about stock investing and also start the learning process on additional streams. Always keep an eye out for any opportunistic ways to kick additional streams off early if you can find a low cost entry. (*) The $100k number is admittedly a rough guess pulled from the air.

There are several downsides to this strategy: You aren't taking into account commissions. If you pay $5 each time you buy or sell a stock, you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts.

Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits. Commissions represent a fixed cost, so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade.

Since you're holding these securities for less than a year, your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. You can deduct your capital losses too (assuming you don't repurchase the same security within 30 days, because in that case, the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss), but it's important to think about gains and losses in real terms, not nominal terms. The story is different if you make these trades in a tax-sheltered account like an IRA, but the other problems still apply. You're implicitly assuming that the stock's prices are skewed in the positive direction.

In short, the glory days of rags to riches by day trading are long gone, if they were ever here in the first place.  Edit: the site will not allow me to add a comment, so I am putting my response here: Possibly, yes. One big 'gotcha' is that your broker reports the proceeds from your sales, but does not report your outflows from your buys. Then there is the risk you take by the broker refusing to sell the security until the transaction settles. Not to mention wash sale rules. You are trying to win at the 'buy low, sell high' game. But you have a 25% chance, at best, of winning at that game. Can you pick the low? Maybe, but you have a 50% chance of being right. Then you have to pick the high. And again you have a 50% chance of doing that. 50% times 50% is 25%. Warren Buffet did not get rich that way. Buffet buys and holds. Don't be a speculator, be a 'buy and hold' investor.

Edit: the site will not allow me to add a comment, so I am putting my response here: Possibly, yes. One big 'gotcha' is that your broker reports the proceeds from your sales, but does not report your outflows from your buys. Then there is the risk you take by the broker refusing to sell the security until the transaction settles. Not to mention wash sale rules. You are trying to win at the 'buy low, sell high' game. But you have a 25% chance, at best, of winning at that game. Can you pick the low? Maybe, but you have a 50% chance of being right. Then you have to pick the high. And again you have a 50% chance of doing that. 50% times 50% is 25%. Warren Buffet did not get rich that way. Buffet buys and holds. Don't be a speculator, be a 'buy and hold' investor.

There are several downsides to this strategy: You aren't taking into account commissions. If you pay $5 each time you buy or sell a stock, you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts. This next point sounds obvious, but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit, so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions. Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits.

My suggestion would be to open an account with a discount brokerage (Schwab, Fidelity, eTrade, etc). The advantage of a brokerage IRA is that you can invest in whatever you want within the account.

This is the form that is filed annually to calculate your tax due for the year, and you either claim a refund if you have overpaid your taxes or send in a payment if you have underpaid.  The form is generally due on April 15 each year, but this year the due date is April 18, 2016. When it comes to filing your taxes, there are two questions you need to ask yourself: \"\"Am I required to file?\"\" and \"\"Should I file?\"\" Am I required to file? The 1040 instructions has a section called \"\"Do I have to file?\"\" with several charts that determine if you are legally required to file.  It depends on your status and your gross income.  If you are single, under 65, and not a dependent on someone else's return, you are not required to file if your 2015 income was less than $10,300.  If you will be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return, however, you must file if your earned income (from work) was over $6300, or your unearned income (from investments) was over $1050, or your gross (total) income was more than the larger of either $1050 or your earned income + $350.

There are two main reasons you might do this: If you have had income where tax has been taken out, you may have overpaid the tax.  Filing the tax return will allow you to get a refund of the amount that you overpaid.

There are several downsides to this strategy: You aren't taking into account commissions. If you pay $5 each time you buy or sell a stock, you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts. This next point sounds obvious, but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit, so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions. Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits. Commissions represent a fixed cost, so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade.

You can deduct your capital losses too (assuming you don't repurchase the same security within 30 days, because in that case, the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss), but it's important to think about gains and losses in real terms, not nominal terms. The story is different if you make these trades in a tax-sheltered account like an IRA, but the other problems still apply. You're implicitly assuming that the stock's prices are skewed in the positive direction.

Edit: the site will not allow me to add a comment, so I am putting my response here: Possibly, yes. One big 'gotcha' is that your broker reports the proceeds from your sales, but does not report your outflows from your buys. Then there is the risk you take by the broker refusing to sell the security until the transaction settles. Not to mention wash sale rules. You are trying to win at the 'buy low, sell high' game. But you have a 25% chance, at best, of winning at that game. Can you pick the low? Maybe, but you have a 50% chance of being right. Then you have to pick the high. And again you have a 50% chance of doing that. 50% times 50% is 25%. Warren Buffet did not get rich that way. Buffet buys and holds. Don't be a speculator, be a 'buy and hold' investor.

So if you bet on the the beginning of a day when the stock was up and if you buy the next day about 66-75% of the time the stock will also be up. So the idea is to realize that 1/3 of the time at least you will cut your losses but 2/3 of the time you will be up then next day as well. So keep holding the position based on the low of the previous day and as the stock rises to your trend line then tighten the stock to the low of the same day or just take your profit and buy something else. But losing 1/3 times is just part of \"\"the unpredictable\"\" nature of the stock market which is causes simply because there are three types of traders all betting at the same time on the same stock.

Though several responses have mentioned the inherent risks that currency speculation, leverage, and frequent trading of stocks or currencies bring about, more information, and possibly a combination of answers, is necessary to fully answer this question. My answer should probably not be the answer, just some additional information to help aid your (and others') decision(s). Firstly, as a retail investor, don't trade forex. Period. Major currency pairs arguably make up the most efficient market in the world, and as a layman, that puts you at a severe disadvantage. You mentioned you were a student\u2014since you have something else to do other than trade currencies, implicitly you cannot spend all of your time researching, monitoring, and investigating the various (infinite) drivers of currency return. Since major financial institutions such as banks, broker-dealers, hedge-funds, brokerages, inter-dealer-brokers, mutual funds, ETF companies, etc..., do have highly intelligent people researching, monitoring, and investigating the various drivers of currency return at all times, you're unlikely to win against the opposing trader. Not impossible to win, just improbable; over time, that probability will rob you clean. Secondly, investing in individual businesses can be a worthwhile endeavor and, especially as a young student, one that could pay dividends (pun intended!) for a very long time. That being said, what I mentioned above also holds true for many large-capitalization equities\u2014there are thousands, maybe millions, of very intelligent people who do nothing other than research a few individual stocks and are often paid quite handsomely to do so. As with forex, you will often be at a severe informational disadvantage when trading. So, view any purchase of a stock as a very long-term commitment\u2014at least five years. And if you're going to invest in a stock, you must review the company's financial history\u2014that means poring through 10-K/Q for several years (I typically examine a minimum ten years of financial statements) and reading the notes to the financial statements.", "title": "", "source": ""}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "F-1 student investing in foreign markets", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "4813dbea-0ccb-41c9-a4e1-48e1d07dcc43", "created_at": 1726252534}}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "It is legal for an F-1 student to trade stocks and have an account with both US and non-US based brokerage firms.

Diplomatic relations and trade agreements tend to be difficult.

You might argue that you can always exchange foreign results into local currency, and that's true.  But then you have two risks.  One risk you'll have anywhere:  your investments may go down.  The other risk with a foreign investment is that the currency may lose value relative to your currency.  If that happens, even a good performing investment can go down in terms of what it can return to you.  That fund denominated in your currency is really doing these conversions behind the scenes.   Unless the bulk of your purchases are from imports and have prices that fluctuate with your currency, you will probably be better off in local investments.  As a rough rule of thumb, your country's import percentage is a good estimate of how much you should invest globally.  That looks to be about 20% for Australia.

Or will this just be a hobby you make some pocket change from?] (2) How much the money the business needs up front [some businesses, like simple web design consulting, might have effectively $0 in cash startup costs, where starting a franchise restaurant might cost you $500k-$1M on day 1] (3) How risky it is [the general stat is that something like 50% of all new businesses fail in their first year, and I think for restaurants that number is often given as 75%+] So sometimes investing in your own business is financially risky, and other times it is not risky.

All those goals are helped by saving money, so your job as someone mindful of personal finances, is to prioritize those goals in accordance to what is important for you. As mentioned by Stannius in the comments below, there is one catch here: if you are saving money for a short term goal (such as starting a business in a year), then you might want to keep it in low-interest savings accounts, instead of investing in the stock market. Doing this would remove the chance that your investments fail right before you need the startup money.

A too-specific request might get you information X when a vague request could have garnered XYZ. Vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections. The third question is difficult to say. My personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity (you didn't say how new this startup is or what series/stage they are on, so I'll try to stay vague). The actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change. Most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent, usually at a monthly rate. A high burn rate relative to infusions of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of toppling (i.e. failing before exit). Burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup. Of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves (and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark, but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you). High burn rate might not be bad, if the company is booming along towards a successful exit. You might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet, rather than financials alone. You want to gauge the size of the market (most startups like to claim 9- or 10-figure markets, so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the 8-figures).", "title": "", "source": ""}, {"document_id": "466835-0-2333", "score": 0.964634418487548, "text": "\n\"This is several questions wrapped together: How can I diplomatically see the company's financial information? How strong a claim does a stockholder or warrantholder have to see the company's financials? What information do I need to know about the company financials before deciding to buy in? I'll start with the easier second question (which is quasi implicit). Stockholders typically have inspection rights. For example, Delaware General Corporate Law \u00a7 220 gives stockholders the right to inspect and copy company financial information, subject to certain restrictions. Check the laws and corporate code of your company's state of incorporation to find the specific inspection right. If it is an LLC or partnership, then the operating agreement usually controls and there may be no inspection rights. If you have no corporate stock, then of course you have no statutory inspection rights. My (admittedly incomplete) understanding is that warrantholders generally have no inspection rights unless somehow contracted for. So if you vest as a corporate stockholder, it'll be your right to see the financials\u2014which may make even a small purchase valuable to you as a continuing employee with the right to see the financials. Until then, this is probably a courtesy and not their obligation. The first question is not easy to answer, except to say that it's variable and highly personal for small companies. Some people interpret it as prying or accusatory, the implication being that the founders are either hiding something or that you need to examine really closely the mouth of their beautiful gift horse. Other people may be much cooler about the question, understanding that small companies are risky and you're being methodical. And in some smaller companies, they may believe giving you the expenses could make office life awkward.

But inside the investment bank\u2019s New York headquarters, it feels like an insult. Goldman is not suffering a financial crisis, as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of Wall Street could collapse. It faces something deeper: an identity crisis. It used to be the role model for many rival banks \u2014 envied even while resented for its single-minded focus on investment banking and trading. But as Tuesday\u2019s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed, banking has changed. Instead of lenders such as JPMorgan Chase wanting to become as glamorous as Goldman, it needs to be more like them. This is a telling moment, albeit less dramatic than 2008. Investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades, spurred by globalisation and financial liberalisation. Goldman\u2019s revenues rose briskly from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007, and boomed in 2009. It could do no wrong financially, although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers. But guess what? Regulation works. Governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives, the securities business in which Goldman specialised, more expensive and less profitable. The rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of wizardry. No one really planned the second aspect of the bank\u2019s difficulty. The huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has damped volatility and made markets more predictable. Hedge funds, themselves under pressure, no longer need to reward Goldman and others for taking on financial risk. Goldman\u2019s bond and commodities trading division \u2014 from which emerged a cadre of leaders including Lloyd Blankfein, its chairman and chief executive \u2014 tells its own story. It used to occupy two floors of the New York office but has shrunk to one as Wall Street\u2019s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009. More prices are calculated by computers than humans. When you rely heavily on one engine and that engine sputters, you are in trouble. The bank\u2019s financial advisory and capital raising division is performing well and it has an investment management arm.", "title": "", "source": ""}, {"document_id": "404295-0-1628", "score": 0.000398939562728, "text": "\nDo you work with low-skilled employees?

But inside the investment bank\u2019s New York headquarters, it feels like an insult. Goldman is not suffering a financial crisis, as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of Wall Street could collapse. It faces something deeper: an identity crisis. It used to be the role model for many rival banks \u2014 envied even while resented for its single-minded focus on investment banking and trading. But as Tuesday\u2019s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed, banking has changed. Instead of lenders such as JPMorgan Chase wanting to become as glamorous as Goldman, it needs to be more like them. This is a telling moment, albeit less dramatic than 2008. Investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades, spurred by globalisation and financial liberalisation. Goldman\u2019s revenues rose briskly from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007, and boomed in 2009. It could do no wrong financially, although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers. But guess what? Regulation works. Governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives, the securities business in which Goldman specialised, more expensive and less profitable. The rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of wizardry. No one really planned the second aspect of the bank\u2019s difficulty. The huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has damped volatility and made markets more predictable. Hedge funds, themselves under pressure, no longer need to reward Goldman and others for taking on financial risk. Goldman\u2019s bond and commodities trading division \u2014 from which emerged a cadre of leaders including Lloyd Blankfein, its chairman and chief executive \u2014 tells its own story. It used to occupy two floors of the New York office but has shrunk to one as Wall Street\u2019s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009. More prices are calculated by computers than humans. When you rely heavily on one engine and that engine sputters, you are in trouble.

Lenders almost exclusively only use FICO scores, so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use. Second, understand that the advice you see from places like Mint and Credit Karma will almost always tell you that you don't have enough credit card accounts.  The reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications.  They have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards. Finally, realize that credit score is just a number, and is only useful for a limited number of things.  Higher is better to a point, and after that, you get no benefit from increasing your score.   My advice to you is this: Don't stress out about your credit score, especially a free score reported by Credit Karma or Mint.  If you really have a desire to find out your score, you can pay FICO to get your actual score, but it's not cheap.  You can also sometimes get your FICO score by applying for a loan and asking the lender.  I last saw my FICO scores (there were three, one from each credit bureau) when I applied for a mortgage a couple of years ago, and the mortgage rep gave them to me for free.  But honestly, knowing your score doesn't do much for you, as the best way to increase it is to simply make your payments on time and wait. Don't give in to bad conventional advice from places that are funded by the financial services industry.  The thing that makes your credit score go up is a long history of paying your bills on time.  Despite what you commonly read about credit scores, I'm not convinced that you can radically boost your scores by having lots of open credit card accounts.  At the time I applied for my last mortgage, I only had 2 open credit cards (still true), and the oldest open account was about 1.5 years old.  The average of my 3 scores was just over 800.  But I've been paying my bills on time for at least 20 years now.

Be careful when obtaining a score for making a big decision that it is a FICO score, because relatively few lenders will lend based on a non-FICO score. That said, some non-FICO scores are easy to obtain and can be roughly translated to an approximation of your score. Barclays US/ Juniper Bank credit cards offer a free Transunion \"\"TransRisk\"\"(TM) score. The TransRisk score is a 900 point scale, while the FICO score is an 850 point scale.

Building credit generally means building up your FICO score. Your FICO score is impacted my many factors, one small one of which is your utilization ratio of your installment loans like student loans. This is the ratio of the current balance to your original balance. To improve your score (slightly) you would want a lower ratio. I would recommend paying your student loan down to 75% ratio as fast as you can and then you can go back to $50/month. A much better way to improve your FICO score is to have revolving credit. Your student loans are not revolving, they are installment loans. Therefore, you should open at least one credit card (assuming you currently have none) right away. The longer you have had a credit card open, the better your FICO score gets. Your revolving credit utilization ratio is way more important than your installment loan ratio. Therefore, to maximize your FICO, try to never have more than 10% utilization on your revolving credit report to the credit bureaus each month. Only the current month's ratio affects your score at any given moment. You can ensure you don't go above 10% by paying your balance before the statement cuts each month to get it below 10% way before any payment would be due. (You should always pay your remaining credit card statement balance in full each month by the due date after the statement cuts to avoid any interest charges.) Note that there is a slight FICO advantage to having at least one major bank credit card instead of just only credit union credit cards. Also, never let all your revolving credit report a zero balance in a month, you must always have at least $1 reporting to the credit bureaus on at least one of your open credit cards or your FICO score will take a big negative hit. If you cannot get a normal credit card, go to a credit union and find one that offers secured credit cards, or a bank that does. A secured credit card is where you place a deposit with the bank that they hold and give you a credit limit to match your security.

Here's an excerpt from a web site (Versions of the FICO scoring model) to explain: One of the first things a newcomer to this board learns is the difference between FICO and FAKO scores. FAKO refers to the non-FICO scores offered by various companies. FAKO scores have little value since few of them are used by lenders and they do not match closely to FICO scores. But even when you stick with FICO scores, confusion can ensue because FICO scores have many different editions, versions, and variations. On a single day, a consumer could theoretically have dozens of different FICO scores, depending on which version and credit agency is used to produce the score. This post provides a summary of the various FICO versions. Please offer any corrections or updates, and they will be edited in. The FICO scoring model with its familiar range of 300 to 850 was first introduced in 1989. Since then, FICO has released five major revisions: 1995, 1998, 2004, 2008, and 2014. Each \"\"edition\"\" uses a different formula and produces a different score. When a new FICO edition is released, many lenders continue using an older version for years before \"\"upgrading.\"\" The 1995 revision is no longer in common use, but later editions are still used by lenders. Most FICO editions are commonly known by the year of introduction: FICO 98, FICO 04, and FICO 08 (although FICO now calls it FICO Score 8, without the zero). The most recent edition is FICO Score 9 introduced in 2014. As of 2014, FICO Score 8 is the most commonly used. However, most mortgage lenders use FICO 04 for Equifax and Transunion, and FICO 98 for Experian. In addition to the \"\"classic\"\" version, FICO offers \"\"Industry Option\"\" versions customized for auto loans, credit cards, installment loans, personal finance loans, and insurance. These have a score range of 250 to 900, so the scores are not fully comparable with \"\"classic\"\" versions.

Payment history (35%) The first thing any lender wants to know is whether you've paid past credit accounts on time. This is one of the most important factors in a FICO\u00ae Score. As @Ben Miller mentioned, checking your credit report to determine whether or not late payments were reported to credit bureaus will give you a sense of whether or not this was effected. You mentioned several bounced payments, which certainly could have caused this. This would be my largest concern with a closed account, is to investigate why and what was reported to the bureaus, and in turn, other lenders. Also, since this has the highest impact on credit scores (35%), it's arguably, the most important. This is further detailed here, which details the public record and late payment effect on your score. Amounts owed (30%) Having credit accounts and owing money on them does not necessarily mean you are a high-risk borrower with a low FICO\u00ae Score....However, when a high percentage of a person's available credit is been used, this can indicate that a person is overextended, and is more likely to make late or missed payments. Given that this card was closed, whatever your credit limit was is now no longer added into your total credit limit. However, your utilization on that card is gone (assuming it gets paid off), depending on any other credit lines, and since you reported \"\"heavy use\"\" that could be a positive impact, though likely not. Length of credit history (15%) In general, a longer credit history will increase your FICO\u00ae Scores. However, even people who haven't been using credit long may have high FICO Scores, depending on how the rest of the credit report looks. Depending how old your card was, and particularly since this was your only credit card, it will likely impact your average age of credit lines, depending on other lines of credit (loans etc) you have open.

What are the road blocks? I think it's just that the barriers to entry are rather high.  Lenders would potentially be interested in a new score if it demonstrably saved them money (by more effectively weeding out risky borrowers), but because the FICO score already exists and they already know how to use it, there are costs and risks in making the transition, so lenders are unlikely to switch without solid evidence.  But to get solid evidence, you would need to test out the new score and see how well it correlated with loan default and so forth.  So there is a catch-22: no one will use the score until they know it works, but you can't know whether it works until people start using it. The existence of non-FICO credit scores (like VantageScore) shows that it is possible for alternatives to crop up.  The question is just whether they have enough concrete advantages to overcome the track record and name recognition of FICO.  Only time will tell. As for why an alternative score wouldn't be open source, you could ask the same about almost anything.

Equifax Credit Score, like FICO, Vantagescore, and others, is based on a proprietary formula that is not publicly available.

Lenders almost exclusively only use FICO scores, so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use. Second, understand that the advice you see from places like Mint and Credit Karma will almost always tell you that you don't have enough credit card accounts.  The reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications.  They have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards. Finally, realize that credit score is just a number, and is only useful for a limited number of things.  Higher is better to a point, and after that, you get no benefit from increasing your score.   My advice to you is this: Don't stress out about your credit score, especially a free score reported by Credit Karma or Mint.

You cannot artificially bring the price of a stock down by buying the stock.  Purchasing large enough amounts would theoretically cause the price to go up, not down.

Imagine an (extreme, contrived) example whereby you own shares in a company that is explicitly intended to only exist for a finite and definite period, say to serve as the producers of a one-time event. Consider a possible sequence of major events in this company's life: So why would the shares of this hypothetical company be worth anything? Because the company itself is worth something, or rather the stuff that the company owns is worth something, even (or in my example, especially) in the event of its dissolution or liquidation. Besides just the stuff that a company owns, why else would owning a portion of a company be a good idea, i.e. why would I pay for such a privilege? Buying shares of a company is a good idea if you believe (and are correct) that a company will make larger profits or capture more value (e.g. buy and control more valuable stuff) than other people believe. If your beliefs don't significantly differ from others then (ideally) the price of the companies stock should reflect all of the future value that everyone expects it to have, tho that value is discounted based on time preference, i.e. how much more valuable a given amount of money or a given thing of value is today versus some time in the future. Some notes on time preference: But apart from whether you should buy shares in a specific company, owning shares can still be valuable. Not only are shares a claim on a company's current assets (in the event of liquidation) but they are also claims on all future assets of the company. So if a company is growing then the value of shares now should reflect the (discounted) future value of the company, not just the value of its assets today. If shares in a company pays dividends then the company gives you money for owning shares. You already understand why that's worth something.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Checking the JSON structure of a document can be useful if you want to check whether certain types of information are being captured.\n\nAfter you enrich your collection, you can use the JSON view of a query result to check whether your enrichments are being applied and retrieved properly. For example, you can check the JSON to confirm that a synonym that you defined in a dictionary is being tagged as an occurrence of the corresponding dictionary term.\n\nTo test your project, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

For more information about passage retrieval, see [Passages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-parameterspassages).\n2. Relevancy Training - Relevancy training computes features for each top-level text field (fields at the same level as document_id in the JSON) in the collection. If there are many top level fields, this can cause a performance impact for a natural_language_query when using training. Reducing the number of top level fields can improve performance. This can be done via normalization or by manually editing the JSON to put fields that are not helpful to finding relevant content in a nested structure.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00474-6472-8322", "score": 0.9865177273750301, "text": "\nWhen the front end submits a team selection to the team route (see [index.html](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-combine-ibm-servicesindex-html-redis)), the app.route function first checks the cache to see whether it has the data already. If it does, then it returns that. Otherwise, it makes a query to IBM Cloudant to retrieve team data, store it in the cache, and return it to the front end.\n\nThe read operation uses an IBM Cloudant design document and a MapReduce view to select documents. This selection is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you can read more about [views and design documents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-views-mapreduce) in the documentation.\n\nThis script also contains some code that uploads test data (contained in the directorydata.json file) to the database the first time it runs.\n\n\n\n\n\n index.html \n\nThe index.html page is the only page of the application that is using the [Vue.js framework](https://vuejs.org/). When it loads, it shows you the available teams.\n\nWhen you select a team, it makes an HTTP POST request with your choice to the /team route of the application (see [redis.js](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-combine-ibm-servicesserver-js-redis)). A successful return from the application contains all the data for the team members. We are displaying only their names and town for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Summary \n\nToday, we combined two IBM Cloud services to optimize cost and user experience: IBM Cloudant as a document store and query engine and Databases for Redis as a content cache. Cached documents can be retrieved more quickly and more cheaply, but the tradeoff is that your application might be showing old data to your users for a time.\n\nIf you followed this tutorial, you must deprovision your resources to stop incurring charges.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-combine-ibm-services"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00644-25890-27361", "score": 0.9857848882675171, "text": "\n\"github.com/IBM/cloudant-go-sdk/cloudantv1\"\n)\n\nAll Go examples require the service object to be initialized.

According to a theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800 -- 450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . Thus this area is sometimes called the `` Celtic homeland '' . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .", "title": "Celts", "source": "https?://(?:www\\.)?(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\\+~#=]{1,256})\\.(:?[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6})(?:[-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\\+.~#?&/=]*)*\\b"}, {"document_id": "852484941_38402-39084-0-676", "score": 0.9244255423545831, "text": "Celts\nClassical writers did not apply the terms \u039a\u03b5\u03bb\u03c4\u03bf\u03af or `` Celtae '' to the inhabitants of Britain or Ireland , leading a number of scholars to question the use of the term Celt to describe the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands .

There are more than 750,000 licensed motorcyclists and that number continues to grow with each passing year. For many people, motorcycling is a fun sport as well as an energy-efficient means of transportation. However, motorcycling can be dangerous. It requires skill, concentration and reasonable precautions.\nMotorcyclists are about 28 times more likely to die in a crash than people in passenger cars. Motorcyclists continue to be overrepresented in traffic-related fatalities; Despite representing only 3% of all registered motor vehicles, motorcyclists account for 14% of all traffic-related fatalities (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2018).\n\nTaking Action\nEfforts to Improve Motorcycle Safety\n\nMotorcycle Safety Program\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles established a rider-funded motorcycle safety program as required by legislation signed in 1997. The program provides accessible and affordable rider education throughout NYS, in an effort\u00a0to create awareness and reduce motorcyclist injuries and fatalities.\n\nMotorcycle Helmet Law\nNew York was the first state in the nation to adopt a universal motorcycle helmet law. This law, effective as of January 1, 1967, requires any person operating or riding a motorcycle to wear a Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved helmet.\u00a0\n\nMotorcycle Safety Awareness Month", "title": "Motorcycle Safety | Governor's Traffic Safety Committee"}, {"document_id": "a6a1bb9577b7a817-3018-4282", "source": "", "score": 12.873465, "text": "DUI Crackdown | Office of Traffic Safety\nIn every state it\u2019s illegal to drive with a BAC of .08 or higher, yet one person is killed in a drunk-driving crash every 52 minutes in the United States.\nOf the 10,076 people killed in drunk-driving crashes in 2013, 65 percent were the drunk drivers themselves.\nIn fatal crashes during the month of August over the five-year period of 2009-2013, almost 1 out of 10 (8%) of the drunk drivers involved had one or more previous convictions for drunk driving.\nMen are more likely than women to be driving drunk in fatal crashes.

Always wear a DOT-approved helmet and eye protection. \"Novelty Helmets\" are not approved and offer little protection to the rider in a crash. In fact, they are illegal to wear on New York roadways.\nAlways wear high quality riding gear designed to protect the rider during a fall. This includes over-the-ankle boots, full finger gloves with padding in addition to jackets and pants with armor protection at impact points.\nBe conspicuous. Wear high visibility vests, garments with reflector features and accessories to boost your visibility to other drivers.\u00a0\nMaintain your motorcycle properly. Ensure all of your lights and horn are working and both mirrors are adjusted. Make sure your tires are properly inflated and have legal tread depth. Remember, motorcycles maintain a smaller tire contact patch on the roadway when compared to other vehicles. Good traction is a key component to safe handling and braking in normal and adverse situations.\nMaintain a high level of awareness. Scan the roadway constantly for dangers and ride alert. If you are tired, take a break and re-energize to boost your concentration.\nDrive sober.

The number of drivers under the influence of drugs, or a combination of drugs and alcohol, is rising. Prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, marijuana, and illegal drugs may affect one\u2019s driving ability, especially in combination with alcohol or other drugs. In 2021 California reported 751 fatalities related to drug-involved driving. Of the fatally injured drivers with known drug tests in California for 2021, 52.9% were positive for drugs \u2013 legal and illegal. Measures to address the issue include increased officer training in identifying and detecting drug impairment in drivers through the Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) and Drug Recognition Evaluator (DRE) programs. The OTS grant programs also include dedicated prosecution teams for drug-impaired driving cases, as well as prosecutor training on handling driving under the influence of drug cases through every step of the criminal process. Education campaigns inform the public about the dangers of driving under the influence of substances other than alcohol, helping shift social norms around drug-impaired driving.\nDRUG-IMPAIRED DRIVING PROGRAM AREA GOALS\n\nProvide increased training to law enforcement to identify drug-impaired drivers.\nReduce the number of persons injured in drug-involved crashes.\nReduce the number of persons killed in drug-involved crashes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0   \u00a0     \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nBack to Top\n\nContact OTS\n\nConditions of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSite Map\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nX\n\nYouTube\n\nCopyright \u00a9  State of California\nPowered by: CAWeb Publishing Service\n\n", "title": "Drug-Impaired Driving | Office of Traffic Safety", "source": "https://www.ots.ca.gov/grants/drug-impaired-driving/"}, {"document_id": "d5f6df9ed4009cb7-0-2711", "score": 0.9812433719635011, "text": "Alcohol-Impaired Driving | Office of Traffic Safety\n\n\nAlcohol-Impaired Driving | Office of Traffic Safety\n\n \n\nSkip to Main Content\n\nCA.gov\n\nShare via Facebook\n\nShare via Instagram\n\nShare via Twitter\n\nShare via YouTube\n\n\tADA Certification\t\n\n\tContact OTS\t\n\n Settings\n\t\n\nDefault\n\nHigh Contrast\n\nReset\n\nIncrease Font Size\nFont Increase\n\nDecrease Font Size\nFont Decrease\n\nDyslexic font\n\n\u00d7\n\nSearch\n\nMenu\n\nAbout OTS\n\n\t\n\tAbout OTS\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOTS\u00a0Equity\u00a0Statement\u00a0\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOTS Strategic Plan\n\t\n\n\t\n\tContact OTS\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOpportunities\n\t\n\nGrants\n\n\t\n\tGrants\n\t\n\n\t\n\tGEMS - Apply for a Grant\n\t\n\n\t\n\tGrant Program Resources\n\t\n\n\t\n\t2023 OTS Grant Highlights\n\t\n\n\t\n\t2022 OTS Grant Highlights\n\t\n\nNewsroom\n\n\t\n\tNewsroom\n\t\n\n\t\n\tPress Releases\n\t\n\n\t\n\tCampaigns\n\t\n\n\t\n\tVictim\u2019s Stories\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOTS Tracks Newsletters\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOTS Logos\n\t\n\nPublications\n\nTraffic Safety Data\n\n\t\n\tTraffic Safety Data\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOTS Crash Rankings\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOther Traffic Resources\n\t\n\nSafe System Approach\n\nGo Safely\n\n Search\n\nCustom Google Search\n\nSubmit\n\nClose Search\n\nAlcohol-Impaired Driving \n\nAlcohol-impaired driving remains one of the biggest threats to public safety and well-being on our roadways. In 2021, 1,370 people were killed in alcohol-involved crashes, a 16% increase from 2020, accounting for nearly a third of all traffic deaths in California (32%). \u00a0The OTS-supported programs look at road safety efforts through the lens of the Safe System approach, which accepts that crashes will happen, and that the focus should be on reducing the severity of injuries when a crash occurs. Under this framework, the OTS is able to better address every aspect of crash risks and implement multiple layers of protection to ensure that everyone traveling on California roadways will go safely. Grant programs include enforcement operations dedicated to stopping and arresting suspected impaired drivers, purchase of equipment such as breath testing devices, monitoring and treatment of high-risk DUI offenders, and youth education programs for high school and college students on the dangers and consequences of impaired driving.\nALCOHOL-IMPAIRED DRIVING PROGRAM AREA GOALS\n\nReduce the number of persons killed in alcohol-involved crashes.\nReduce the number of persons injured in alcohol-involved crashes.\nReduce hit-and-run fatal crashes.\nReduce hit-and-run injury crashes.\nReduce nighttime (2100 \u2013 0259 hours) fatal crashes.\nReduce nighttime (2100 \u2013 0259 hours) injury crashes.\nReduce the number of motorcyclists killed in alcohol-involved crashes.\nReduce the number of motorcyclists injured in alcohol-involved crashes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0   \u00a0     \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nBack to Top\n\nContact OTS\n\nConditions of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSite Map\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nX\n\nYouTube\n\nCopyright \u00a9  State of California\nPowered by: CAWeb Publishing Service\n\n", "title": "Alcohol-Impaired Driving | Office of Traffic Safety", "source": "https://www.ots.ca.gov/grants/alcohol-impaired-driving/"}, {"document_id": "52a0eb5b1cb38d66-1531-3243", "score": 0.954064488410949, "text": "Impaired Driving | Governor's Traffic Safety Committee\nAdvanced law enforcement training across New York state.\n\nDRE / ARIDE Training\n\ncard image\n\n DRE Program Resources\n\n Contact information for DRE Officers and Agency Coordinators, as well as login for the DRE Data Management System.\n\nDRE Agency CoordinatorsDRE Data Management LoginNYS DRE Officers\n\nDRE Program Resources\n\nCannabis & Driving\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nEmpowering Communities\nSTOP-DWI Program\nSTOP-DWI is a statewide alcohol and highway safety program that enables counties to coordinate efforts to reduce alcohol and drug-related crashes.\n\nCoordinator Portal\n\nProgram Info & High Visibility Engagement Campaign Dates\n\nCoordinator Contact Page\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nEducational Materials\nFind materials and resources to educate yourself and others about impaired driving.\n\nSearch Materials\n\nTips and Information\nEveryone can play a role in deterring impaired driving.

The facts indicate otherwise. Research conducted in many parts of this country over a span of several decades has shown that drivers are influenced more by the appearance of the highway itself and the prevailing traffic conditions than by the posted speed limit. California's Basic Speed Law requires that:\"No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is responsible or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property.\"Under California law, the maximum speed limit for any passenger vehicle is now 65 miles per hour (MPH). All other speed limits are called prima facie limits, which \"on the face of it\" are safe and prudent under normal conditions. Certain prima facie limits are established by law and include the 25 MPH limit in business and residential districts, the 15 MPH limit in alleys, at blind intersections and blind railroad crossings and a part-time 25 MPH limit in school zones when children are going to and from school. These speeds are not always posted but all California motorists are required to know these 10, 20, and 30 mile per hour speed laws.Intermediate speed limits between 25 and 55 miles per hour may be established by local authorities on the basis of traffic engineering surveys. These surveys include an analysis of roadway conditions, accident records, and the prevailing speed, or 85th percentile, of prudent drivers.", "title": "FAQs \u2022 San Bruno, CA \u2022 CivicEngage", "source": "https://www.sanbruno.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx"}, {"document_id": "2b28eb74ce4f823b-1470-3036", "score": 0.933512091636657, "text": "Director\u2019s Biography \u2014 Barbara L.

In the early days, funding, expertise, and results were scarce. Over the years, OTS staff became skilled professionals, programs expanded, and local authorities embraced the traffic safety message. Interest grew, priorities areas were established, and traffic deaths and injuries began to fall.\nEach year a Highway Safety Plan (HSP) is developed to reflect current needs as well as detailing the planned use of federal funds. The HSP identifies problems, specific performance measures, proposed solutions, time frames and fiscal information on continuing and planned new grants which are designed to mitigate traffic safety problems.

There are more than 750,000 licensed motorcyclists and that number continues to grow with each passing year. For many people, motorcycling is a fun sport as well as an energy-efficient means of transportation. However, motorcycling can be dangerous. It requires skill, concentration and reasonable precautions.\nMotorcyclists are about 28 times more likely to die in a crash than people in passenger cars. Motorcyclists continue to be overrepresented in traffic-related fatalities; Despite representing only 3% of all registered motor vehicles, motorcyclists account for 14% of all traffic-related fatalities (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2018).\n\nTaking Action\nEfforts to Improve Motorcycle Safety\n\nMotorcycle Safety Program\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles established a rider-funded motorcycle safety program as required by legislation signed in 1997. The program provides accessible and affordable rider education throughout NYS, in an effort\u00a0to create awareness and reduce motorcyclist injuries and fatalities.\n\nMotorcycle Helmet Law\nNew York was the first state in the nation to adopt a universal motorcycle helmet law.

Always wear a DOT-approved helmet and eye protection. \"Novelty Helmets\" are not approved and offer little protection to the rider in a crash. In fact, they are illegal to wear on New York roadways.\nAlways wear high quality riding gear designed to protect the rider during a fall. This includes over-the-ankle boots, full finger gloves with padding in addition to jackets and pants with armor protection at impact points.\nBe conspicuous. Wear high visibility vests, garments with reflector features and accessories to boost your visibility to other drivers.\u00a0\nMaintain your motorcycle properly. Ensure all of your lights and horn are working and both mirrors are adjusted. Make sure your tires are properly inflated and have legal tread depth. Remember, motorcycles maintain a smaller tire contact patch on the roadway when compared to other vehicles. Good traction is a key component to safe handling and braking in normal and adverse situations.\nMaintain a high level of awareness. Scan the roadway constantly for dangers and ride alert. If you are tired, take a break and re-energize to boost your concentration.\nDrive sober. Never ride impaired by alcohol or drugs and discourage other riders from making a bad choice.", "title": "Tips for Motorcyclists and Motorists | Governor's Traffic Safety Committee", "source": "https://trafficsafety.ny.gov/tips-motorcyclists-and-motorists"}, {"document_id": "abebc7ae329f6e6a-48060-49374", "score": 0.9416584968566891, "text": "New York DMV | Press Releases\nConduct Commercial Driver License Road Tests Under New ProgramMay 17, 2022MEDIA ADVISORY: Governor\u2019s Traffic Safety Committee and NASCAR Driver Ross Chastain Kick Off Annual \u201cBuckle Up New York, Click It or Ticket\u201d Enforcement CampaignMay 13, 2022Governor\u2019s Traffic Safety Committee Warns of Rise in Fatal Motorcycle Crashes During Motorcycle Safety Awareness MonthMay 12, 2022Governor's Traffic Safety Committee Announces Free Child Seat Inspections and Assistance in Livingston CountyMay 11, 2022MEDIA ADVISORY: GTSC Marks Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month and Warns of Rise in Fatal Motorcycle CrashesMay 6, 2022DMV Encourages Motorists to Show Their Love of NYS Parks with a Custom PlateMay 6, 2022Governor's Traffic Safety Committee Announces Free Child Seat Inspections and Assistance in Niagara and Erie CountiesMay 5, 2022New York State DMV Warns Consumers of Surge in Catalytic Converter Thefts StatewideMay 5, 2022Governor's Traffic Safety Committee Announces Free Child Seat Inspections and Assistance in Broome CountyMay 5, 2022Governor's Traffic Safety Committee Announces Free Child Seat Inspections and Assistance in Orange, Dutchess, and Ulster CountiesMay 5, 2022Governor's Traffic Safety Committee Announces Free Child Seat Inspections and Assistance in Albany CountyMay 4, 2022Governor's Traffic", "title": "New York DMV | Press Releases", "source": "https://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/press-releases"}, {"document_id": "6cf5110384652d5f-1309-3588", "score": 0.9259834885597221, "text": "New York DMV | Learner Permits\nSubmit your vision test now to clear your suspension.\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPrint\n\nLearner Permits\n\nGetting a permit is the first step to get your driver license.

The facts indicate otherwise. Research conducted in many parts of this country over a span of several decades has shown that drivers are influenced more by the appearance of the highway itself and the prevailing traffic conditions than by the posted speed limit. California's Basic Speed Law requires that:\"No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is responsible or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property.\"Under California law, the maximum speed limit for any passenger vehicle is now 65 miles per hour (MPH). All other speed limits are called prima facie limits, which \"on the face of it\" are safe and prudent under normal conditions. Certain prima facie limits are established by law and include the 25 MPH limit in business and residential districts, the 15 MPH limit in alleys, at blind intersections and blind railroad crossings and a part-time 25 MPH limit in school zones when children are going to and from school. These speeds are not always posted but all California motorists are required to know these 10, 20, and 30 mile per hour speed laws.Intermediate speed limits between 25 and 55 miles per hour may be established by local authorities on the basis of traffic engineering surveys. These surveys include an analysis of roadway conditions, accident records, and the prevailing speed, or 85th percentile, of prudent drivers.", "title": "FAQs \u2022 San Bruno, CA \u2022 CivicEngage", "source": "https://www.sanbruno.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx"}, {"document_id": "4acbb81f4f18c9a2-162350-164643", "score": 0.013350537978112, "text": "FAQs \u2022 San Bruno, CA \u2022 CivicEngage\nCertain prima facie limits are established by law and include the 25 MPH limit in business and residential districts, the 15 MPH limit in alleys, at blind intersections and blind railroad crossings and a part-time 25 MPH limit in school zones when children are going to and from school.

These surveys include an analysis of roadway conditions, accident records, and the prevailing speed, or 85th percentile, of prudent drivers. If speed limit signs are posted for a lower limit than is considered reasonable, many drivers will simply ignore the signs. At the same time, other drivers will stay within the posted limits. This generally increases the conflicts between faster and slower drivers, reduces the gaps in traffic through which crossings could be made safely and increases the difficulty for pedestrians to judge the speed, of approaching vehicles. Studies have shown that where uniformity of speed is not maintained, accidents generally increase. \n\n2.\nWhat flood zone is my property in?\n\nThe entire City is a C Zone (no floods).

They are not always an asset to traffic control. In some instances, total accidents and severe injuries increased after signals were installed. Usually, in such instances, right angle collisions were reduced by the traffic signals, but the total number of collisions, especially the rear-end type, increased.There are times when the installation of signals results in an increase in the number of pedestrian accidents. Many pedestrians feel secure with a painted crosswalk and a red light between them and an approaching vehicle.
