The next part is called The Document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Document video \n\nLearn about IBM Cloudant databases and documents work.\n\n\n\n* The Document video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 2 - The IBM Cloudant Document.\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that IBM Cloudant is a JSON document store. Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai). Each instance is deployed in a highly available configuration; that is, data is replicated by each database onto one or more servers, making the data highly available during normal operations.\n\n\n\n* In MZRs, database members are distributed across different data centers, or zones.\n* In single-campus multizone regions, database members are distributed across different hosts.\n\n\n\nIf a single-campus multizone region failure in an MZR or a hardware failure in any region occurs, your data is still accessible as it is replicated onto other fully functioning database servers.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database.

Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.\n\nThe files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called objects. Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) [to very large] (up to 10TB). They are organized into buckets that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06968-15099-17180", "score": 19.135187, "text": "\n[checkmark icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/icons/checkmark-icon.svg) \n\n\n\n\n\n* PDF files that are secured with a password or certificate are not supported.

Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00518-7-1546", "score": 18.570068, "text": "\nDesign document management \n\nThe scalable JSON data store for IBM Cloudant has several querying mechanisms, all of which generate indices that are created and maintained separately from the core data.\n\nArticle contributed by Glynn Bird, Developer Advocate at IBM Cloudant, [glynn@cloudant.com](mailto:glynn@cloudant.com).\n\nIndexing isn't performed immediately when a document is saved.

This primary index is in _id order and is used to allow IBM Cloudant to retrieve documents by their _id - thus behaving like a key-value store.\n\nBy careful design of your _id field, you can make it use the primary index to keep data together that makes sense in the primary index.

You create an IBM Cloudant database and add JSON documents that model your own data. Remember to create secondary indexes to help service your query access patterns so that query performance remains quick as your data volume grows.\n\nIf you don't fancy writing JavaScript, we have SDKs for [Java\u2122, Python, and Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant), plus our [HTTP API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant). Don't forget. The [IBM Cloudant Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-connectingibm-cloudant-dashboard) is a great way to explore your databases, create and modify documents, and refine your index and querying skills.\n\nYou can find more best practice guidance in our [blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/2019/11/21/Best-and-Worst-Practices.html) and [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant/getting-started.html).

You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings\n* Encrypted data storage limit, for example 1 GB\n* Provisioned throughput capacity\n\n\n\nYou can easily find services for Lite plans in the catalog.

GB-hours is the calculation of the number of application instances that are multiplied by the memory per instance and by the hours that the instances run. You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity.

For examples of how to complete common tasks, see [Passing values](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-configweb-chat-config-context).\n* Change the language that is used by the web chat.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03196-30333-32476", "score": 22.72533, "text": "\nIn the Message before link to web chat field, edit the introductory message to display to the user (in the originating channel) before the link that initiates the transfer.

The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03180-5630-7213", "score": 20.379684, "text": "\nEnabling visitor authentication also enables support for cross-domain traffic and cross-browser identification.

By default, the web chat launcher appears in a small initial state as a circle in the bottom right corner:\n\n![An example of the initial launcher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/web-chat-icon.png)\n\nAfter 15 seconds, the launcher expands to show a greeting message to the user. In this expanded state, a customer can still click the launcher to open the web chat. (If the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page before the launcher has expanded, the 15-second timer restarts.)\n\nThe appearance of this expanded state differs slightly depending on whether the customer is using a desktop browser or a mobile browser:\n\n\n\n* For desktop browsers, the expanded launcher shows two primary buttons the customer can click to open the web chat, and a Close button that closes the launcher.\n\n![An example of the desktop launcher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/desktop-launcher.png)\n\nThe expanded launcher remains in its expanded state even if the customer reloads the page or navigates to a different page. It stays in its expanded state until the customer either opens it by clicking on either of the two primary buttons, or closes it, at which point it returns to its initial small state for the rest of the session.\n* For mobile browsers, the launcher shows only a single primary button.\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-architecture"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 15.166199, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

Similarly, you might want to display a form after the web chat closes (for example, a customer satisfaction survey). You can use the same approach for either situation.\n\nWhen the web chat is opened or closed, it fires an [event](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-events) that you can subscribe to. In your event handler, you can use the [custom panels](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-rendercustompanel) feature to open a panel with custom content.\n\nBy returning a promise that is resolved when the custom panel closes, you can pause the process of opening or closing the web chat until after the customer completes the form.\n\nThis example shows how to create a pre-chat form.

The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

For example, you must keep up with browser support changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and design the layout and styling. The time you spend designing and maintaing a UI can be better spent building a quality assistant instead. When you use the web chat integration, you can rely on us to manage the user interface, so you can focus on designing conversational exchanges that address the unique business needs of your customers. Cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research is incorporated into the web chat to deliver an exceptional user experience.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy the web chat, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

You can also use a WebView to embed the web chat in your mobile app.\n\nFor detailed reference information about the web chat API, see the web chat [developer documentation](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=).\n\nTo add the web chat widget to your website or a WebView in your mobile app, all you need to do is embed a generated script element in your HTML source (for more information about the embed script, see [Embedding the web chat on your page](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-web-chat)). Within this embed script, you can use the web chat API to customize or extend the web chat.\n\nThe web chat API consists of several components:\n\n\n\n* Configuration object: The embed script defines a configuration object named watsonAssistantChatOptions, which specifies configuration objects for the web chat widget. By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered. For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationconfigurationobject) in the web API reference.\n* Instance methods: The web chat instance methods provide low-level control of the web chat widget. You can use the instance methods to implement custom behavior such as changing how the web chat widget opens, showing and hiding content, and setting identity information. For more information about the available instance methods, see [List of methods and properties](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methodslistofmethods) in the web chat API reference.\n* Events: The web chat event system makes it possible for your website to respond to web chat events (such as opening or closing the web chat window, sending or receiving messages).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16375-2380-4419", "score": 18.858717, "text": "\nsetTimeout(function(){const t=document.createElement('script');t.src=\"https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/versions/\" + (window.watsonAssistantChatOptions.clientVersion || 'latest') + \"/WatsonAssistantChatEntry.js\";document.head.appendChild(t);});\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\nShow more\n\nIn your app, make sure you include logic to hide your web chat launching mechanism when the device is offline. If the device goes offline in the middle of a conversation, appropriate error messages and retries occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using a JavaScript bridge \n\nIn some situations, your mobile application might need to communicate with the Watson Assistant web chat. For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16334-20193-22029", "score": 18.777273, "text": "\n* \"User is typing\" support: The web chat now supports displaying the \"user is typing\" message for service desks.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}]}

This is a prerequisite for high availability groups on Windows servers.\n* External - Uses an external cluster manager. For example, SQL Server on Linux supports Pacemaker. Availability groups on Linux clusters require at least two synchronous replicas to guarantee HA, but at least three replicas for automatic recovery, so it is recommend that an availability group is setup on at least three nodes.\n* None - Known as clusterless availability groups or was initially referred to as a read-scale availability group. However, this option provides only a subset of availability groups features, and does not include automatic failover. The features do include manual planned and forced failover and both synchronous and asynchronous replication modes, readable secondary nodes, and secondary replica backups. Availability groups without a WSFC cluster can still provide readable secondary nodes, read-only routing, and load balancing. Failover can be automated with external tools.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

These applications and tenants require isolation from each other for security, fault isolation, and avoiding overlapping IP addressing issues. The NSX logical switch creates logical broadcast domains or segments (VXLAN vWires) to which an application or tenant virtual machine can be logically wired. This feature allows for flexibility and speed of deployment while still providing all the characteristics of a physical network's broadcast domains (VLANs) without physical Layer 2 sprawl. Logical switches allow for thousands of tenant networks to be provisioned onto a single IBM Cloud private network (VLAN). A logical switch is distributed and can span arbitrarily large compute clusters, even across pods within the same data center. This distribution allows for virtual machine mobility within the data center without limitations of physical Layer 2 (VLAN) boundaries across pods.\n\n\n\n\n\n Logical routers \n\nDynamic routing provides the necessary forwarding information between Layer 2 broadcast domains (VXLAN, vWires, Logical Switches).

Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

Therefore, if you want to repeat the entire action up to this point, you must select all of the previous steps.\n\nThe current step you are editing is automatically included in the list of steps to be repeated. To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated. For example, you might have a step that repeats previous steps only if the user answered No to a confirmation question; this way, if the user answers Yes, nothing is repeated and the action continues.\n3.

Instead of jumping directly to a later step, control the flow through the intervening steps with step conditions or skipping steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n Go to a subaction \n\nAn action that is called from another action is referred to as a subaction. This option switches the conversation flow to another action. If you have an action flow that can be applied across multiple actions, you can use a subaction to build it once and then call it from each action that needs it.

Queries that are submitted from the product user interface are natural language queries. When quoted text is submitted in a natural language query, the phrase is used to boost result scores. However, results are not limited to documents that contain the entire phrase.\n\nIf you want more control over how queries are handled, you must use the query API.

When you submit a query, the query text is analyzed and optimized before it is submitted to the project. One of the changes that occurs is the removal of any stop words from the text. A stop word is a word that is considered to be not useful in distinguishing the semantic meaning of the content. Examples of stop words include terms such as and, the, and about. Discovery defines a list of stop words that it ignores automatically both when the data is indexed and when it is searched. When you submit a query that contains mostly or only stop words, such as About us, it is equivalent to submitting an empty query.\n\nAlthough us is not included in the stop words list, it is lemmatized to we, which is listed as a stop word.\n\nYou can edit the stop words that are used by your collection. However, you can only augment the stop words list; you cannot remove stop words. And the stop words that you define are used only at query time.

And more processing is applied automatically depending on the project type. When processes run on documents in a collection, extra fields are added to store information that is associated with the process.

Query expansion terms are typically synonyms, antonyms, or common misspellings for terms.\n\nSynonyms that you add to improve the search results function differently from synonyms that you add to a dictionary.

Starting with the above example: if filter C is added and it references B in its before field, then A's before field should be modified to point to C, so the order of application would be A, C and finally B.<br> * A filter that has an empty before reference is applied last (though the date order mentioned still applies). So continuing the preceding examples, if filter B has an empty before field, then it is applied last, but if filter D is created with an empty before field, then B's before field is modified to point to D, so B is applied before D. <br> Example: 1a15dcab-7e40-45e1-b7c5-bc690eaa9782<br><br><br> \n ge <br>integer IP prefix greater than or equal to this number is processed.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-adding-prefix-filters"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06308-0-500", "score": 16.771732, "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  APIs and SDKs \n\nWatson Query provides REST APIs that you can use to interact with your instance.\n\nTo access data, view and create database objects, administer, and monitor your service, use the [Watson Query APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/data-virtualization-on-cloud).\n\nThe following Watson Query SDKs are supported by IBM:\n\n\n\n*  [Go SDK](https://github.com/IBM/data-virtualization-on-cloud-go-sdk/)\n*  [Java SDK](https://github.com/IBM/data-virtualization-on-cloud-java-sdk/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/data-virtualization?topic=data-virtualization-con_rest_api"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00512-5160-7348", "score": 16.112337, "text": "\nSee also a brief overview of the underlying querying mechanism that you use to select the query mechanism that is best for each query your application needs to make.\n\n\n\n Global querying \n\nYou can make global queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a global query, the database must perform a scatter-gather operation across all data in the database. This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00522-2652-4218", "score": 22.550165, "text": "\nOpen the service instance that you created in the prerequisite section.\n3.

But if you're running a production application where the data set is expanding all the time, you definitely don't want to rely on unindexed queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating an index \n\nTo create an index, we can tell IBM Cloudant to create an index on the publisher and year fields that we are using in our query.\n\n\n\n1.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-62356-64581", "score": 22.192104, "text": "\nSometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens. This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields. It also has some powerful counting aggregations suitable for drill-down user interfaces.\n\nIBM Cloudant Search also powers type=text IBM Cloudant Query indexes, so a subset of its capabilities is surfaced by using the _find API.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-60601-62822", "score": 22.064617, "text": "\nWhen you create a secondary index, you choose whether its purpose is for per-partition or global scope.\n\nThat's the end of this part.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz. Notice the asterisk wildcard.\n* Find documents whose author is in the range austen to dickens.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00579-2977-4822", "score": 21.956936, "text": "\n* IBM Cloudant guide to using [views](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-viewsusing-views)\n* Performance implications of using [include_docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-using-viewsmulti-document-fetching)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Never rely on the default behavior of IBM Cloudant Query\u2019s no-indexing \n\nIt\u2019s tempting to rely on IBM Cloudant Query's ability to query without creating explicit indexes. This practice is costly in terms of performance, as every lookup is a full scan of the database rather than an indexed lookup. If your data is small, this full-scan lookup doesn\u2019t matter, but as the data set grows, performance becomes a problem for you, and for the cluster as a whole. It is likely that we will limit this facility soon. The IBM Cloudant Dashboard provides a method for creating indexes in an easy way.\n\nCreating indexes and crafting IBM Cloudant Queries that take advantage of them requires some flair. To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index. Some examples exist where this type of indexing is abused either deliberately, or mostly by mistake. Plan your indexing to comprise only the fields required by your actual queries. Indexes take up space and can be costly to rebuild if the number of indexed fields are large.\n\nWe also have the issue of which fields that you store in an IBM Cloudant Search.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00491-1283-3050", "score": 21.887848, "text": "\n(Optional) [Create an acurl alias](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-working-with-curlencode-user-name-and-password).\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to set up acurl, use the following URL with curl instead of the one provided in the exercises, curl \"https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/databasedemo\".\n\nThe acurl alias is more secure.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}]}

The initial volume and network bandwidth allocation depends on the [instance profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles) and the bandwidth ratio that you selected for your instance.\n\nThe allocation of the instance's total bandwidth can be adjusted, balancing between network bandwidth and volume bandwidth. If you do not specify the initial volume and network bandwidth allocation, then 25% of total instance bandwidth is allocated to volume bandwidth and 75% is allocated to network bandwidth.\n\nThe maximum volume bandwidth is the highest potential bandwidth that can be allocated to the volume when it is attached to an instance. In cases where the total maximum bandwidth of attached volumes exceeds the amount that is available on the instance, the bandwidth for each volume attachment is set proportionally. The bandwidth is allocated based on the corresponding volume's maximum bandwidth.\n\nThe volume bandwidth available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis.

Maximum throughput is 1024 MBps.\n\nThe application I/O size directly impacts storage performance.

When only a single host that is accessing the volume, it can be difficult to realize the maximum IOPS available, especially at extreme IOPS counts (10,000s). If your workload requires high throughput, it would be best to configure at least a couple servers to access your volume to avoid a single-server bottleneck.\n\n\n\n\n\n Network connection \n\nThe speed of your Ethernet connection must be faster than the expected maximum throughput from your volume. Generally, don't expect to saturate your Ethernet connection beyond 70% of the available bandwidth. For example, if you have 6,000 IOPS and are using a 16-KB block size, the volume can handle approximately 94-MBps throughput. If you have a 1-Gbps Ethernet connection to your volume, it becomes a bottleneck when your servers attempt to use the maximum available throughput. It's because 70 percent of the theoretical limit of a 1-Gbps Ethernet connection (125 MB per second) would allow for 88 MB per second only.\n\nTo achieve maximum IOPS, adequate network resources need to be in place.

A time-series is a unique combination of a metric name and label key-value pairs. For example: website_failedRequest |region='Asia', customer_ID='abc'. A data-point is the value generated for a time-series at a given point in time.\n\nLabels are classified as infrastructure labels and metric descriptor labels. Each metric has a set of pre-defined labels. For custom metrics, you can configure more labels.\n\nYou can use labels to identify and differentiate characteristics of a metric, for example,\n\n\n\n* You can group infrastructure objects into logical hierarchies.\n* You can filter out data.\n* You can split aggregated data into segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Collecting default metrics by using the Monitoring agent \n\nWhen you configure a Monitoring agent, data for default metrics is automatically collected.

The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server. This capability allows you to decentralize the management of a large domain (such as ibm.com).\n\nA custom domain name server allows you to utilize the DNS provider's servers with the customized reference name of your own domain. For example, you can define your name server to be ns1.cloud.ibm.com instead of ns1.acme.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure DNS \n\nDNSSec is a technology to digitally 'sign' DNS data so you can be assured it is valid. To eliminate vulnerability from the internet, DNSSec must be deployed at each step in the lookup, from root zone to final domain name (for example, www.icann.org).\n\n\n\n\n\n Root record CNAME flattening \n\nIBM CIS supports a feature called \"CNAME Flattening.\" Using this method, root records can overcome the IETF RFC restriction that if a root record is a CNAME, it cannot have any other records for that domain.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-dns-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05351-9684-10230", "score": 20.570652, "text": "\nDelete your DNS records from CIS.

If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP.

TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet.

Each data center must have their own private and public VLANs and IP addresses for the uplinks. These IP addresses cannot move between the data centers. Therefore, it requires your attention for routing and network address translation if you use public connectivity in this topology.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multisite \u2013 multitenant \n\nMultisite \u2013 single tenant is also a use case and network deployment pattern where tenants require a solution with conflicting IP spaces and complete route table isolation. This topology provides seamless site recovery by using dynamic routing protocols, such as BGP. The vCenter Server automation doesn't deploy multisite topology automatically. However, you can customize the default single-site topology post initial vCenter Server deployment. When you have the compute capacity in the required data center, you can deploy the required extra edge nodes manually. Then, you can create a new edge cluster for the Tier-0 and Tier-1 gateways through NSX-T. This overlay topology is highly scalable and it is possible to automate, for example by using Ansible and Terraform.\n\nThis option is suitable for customers with workloads that run on a multiple data center, single tenant, and have overlapping IP addresses inside their own workloads.\n\nOverlapping IP addresses refers to overlay segments between customer environments that run on the vCenter Server instance.\n\nThe following diagram shows an example of a multisite \u2013 multitenant topology. It consists of a two layer Tier-0 design with three edge clusters. The routing table separation is done at Tier-1 and optionally also at the regional Tier-0 level. For this, consider two edge clusters in the two data centers or zones in a multizone region. And also, one edge cluster deployed across the multizone region with edge nodes in each participating zone or data center.\n\nZoom\n\n!", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-v2t-example-overlays"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04136-1771-3582", "score": 9.673625, "text": "\nAn attacker can use one or multiple attack vectors, and might even cycle through these attack vectors based on countermeasures taken by the target.\n\nCommon types are:\n\n\n\n* Application layer attacks (Layer 7)\n* Protocol attacks (Layer 3 and Layer 4)\n* Volumetric attacks (amplification attacks)\n\n\n\n\n\n Application layer attacks \n\nAn application layer attack is sometimes referred to as a Layer-7 DDoS attack (in reference to the 7th layer of the OSI model).

The three line graphs are: Bandwidth, Hits by Mapping, and Hits by Type. They display the activity daily over the course of your specified timeframe. The graphs for Bandwidth and Hits by Mapping are single-line graphs, whereas the breakdown of Hits by Type shows a line for each of the hit types provided. The pie chart displays a regional breakdown of the bandwidth for a CDN mapping on a percentage basis.\n\nMetrics that are shown for aggregate values include Bandwidth Usage in GB, Total Hits to the CDN Edge server, and the Hit Ratio. Hit Ratio indicates that the percentage of times content is delivered by the Edge server, not through its origin. Hit ratio currently is shown as a function of all your CDN mappings, not just the one being viewed.\n\nBy default, both the aggregate numbers and the graphs default to show metrics for the last 30 days, but you can change this through the [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

However, in many filter function use cases, only the doc parameter is used.\n\nSee the following example design document that includes a filter function:\n\n{\n\"_id\":\"_design/example_design_doc\",\n\"filters\": {\n\"example_filter\": \"function (doc, req) { ... }\"\n}\n}\n\nSee the following example of a filter function:\n\nfunction(doc, req){\n// we need only mail documents\nif (doc.type != 'mail'){\nreturn false;\n}\n// we're interested only in new ones", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-design-documents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05832-21399-23084", "score": 14.84151, "text": "\nIf not provided, the filter is applied to all the cluster logging configurations that are passed to the filter.

Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-1659-3917", "score": 24.168016, "text": "\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it. In fact, some US states have laws that require chat bots to identify themselves as chat bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Who will build your assistant? \n\nAssemble a team with people who understand your customers and their needs, people who know how to interact with customers to reach the best outcomes. These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03353-5263-7331", "score": 19.996344, "text": "\nItalian (it) GA Deprecated \n Japanese (ja) GA Deprecated \n Korean (ko) GA Deprecated \n Portuguese (Brazilian) (pt-br) GA Deprecated \n Spanish (es) GA Deprecated \n Universal (xx) GA NA \n\n\n\nThe Watson Assistant service supports multiple languages as noted, but the tool interface itself (descriptions, labels, etc.) is in English.

This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030. The Watson Assistant service supports this encoding, and is certified GB18030-compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing a skill language \n\nOnce a skill has been created, its language cannot be modified. If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user.

You can restore storage volumes during instance creation, instance modification, or when you provision a new stand-alone volume. For data volumes, you can also use the volumes API to create a data volume from a snapshot.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key.

The list starts with the most fundamental concepts.\n\n\n\n Hardware security module \n\nA hardware security module (HSM) is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing. HSMs of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services are FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified, which is the highest level of security for cryptographic hardware. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Crypto units \n\nA crypto unit is a single unit that represents an HSM and the corresponding software stack that is dedicated to the HSM for cryptography. In Hyper Protect Crypto Services, the following types of crypto unit are available:\n\n\n\n* Operational crypto unit", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13108-7-2001", "score": 16.453842, "text": "\nAbout Key Protect \n\nIBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae is a full-service encryption solution that allows data to be secured and stored in IBM Cloud using the latest envelope encryption techniques that leverage FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified cloud-based hardware security modules.\n\nSensitive data should not be stored on any cloud provider unencrypted (as \"plaintext\", in other words). But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world? In that scenario, your data is only as secure as the computers and connections of those with the data encryption key.\n\nThe solution is a key management system like Key Protect, which keeps data secure by encrypting the data encryption keys (DEKs) that encrypt your plaintext data with root keys managed by IBM via an impenetrable HSM. In this kind of a system, known as \"envelope encryption\", the process of decrypting the data means first \"unwrapping\" the encrypted DEK (opening its envelope, in other words) and then using the DEK to decrypt the data.\n\nFor more information about envelope encryption works, check out [Protecting data with envelope encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-envelope-encryption).\n\n\n\n What Key Protect offers", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07982-7-2122", "score": 16.379524, "text": "\nHandling and securing secrets \n\nA secret is any piece of data that is sensitive within the context of an application or service.

Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium; no one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission.\n\nA VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to manually provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance.

Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the address range in which subnets can be created. If the default address scheme does not suit your requirements, such as if you want to bring your own public IPv4 address range, you can customize the address prefixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Characteristics of subnets in the VPC \n\nEach subnet consists of a specified IP address range (CIDR block). Subnets are bound to a single zone, and they cannot span multiple zones or regions.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05707-4888-6797", "score": 22.906408, "text": "\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service on IBM Cloud Public delivers powerful tools by combining Docker containers, the Kubernetes technology, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security and isolation to automate the deployment, operation, scaling, and monitoring of containerized apps in a cluster of compute hosts For more information, see [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service technology](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).\n: You can also create your cluster in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which gives you the security of a private cloud environment with isolated networking features along with the dynamic scalability of the public cloud.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume.

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router.

A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency.

When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance. Instances are available on the x86 architecture. After you provision an instance, you control and manage those infrastructure resources.\n\n\n\n How are virtual server instances for VPC different from other IBM virtual server offerings? \n\nIn the IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for Classic infrastructure offering, instances use native subnet and VLAN networking to communicate to each other within a data center (and single pod). Using subnet and VLAN networking in one pod works well until you must scale up or have large virtual resource demands that require resources to be created between pods. (Adding appliances for VLAN spanning can get expensive and complicated!)\n\nIBM Cloud VPC adds a network orchestration layer that eliminates the pod boundary, creating increased capacity for scaling instances. The network orchestration layer handles all of the networking for all virtual server instances that are within a VPC across regions and zones. With the software-defined networking capabilities that VPC provides, you have more options for multi-vNIC instances and larger subnet sizes.\n\nTo review and start deploying compute resources, see the following topics:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

It gives you cloud security, with the ability to scale dynamically, by providing fine-grained control over your virtual infrastructure and your network traffic segmentation.\n\nEach VPC is deployed to a single region. Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nIBM Cloud virtual or IBM Cloud bare metal server presented in your VPC is attached to subnets. Subnets within the VPC offer private connectivity, thus your servers can communicate within and between the subnets by using an implicit router. Subnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway, or you can assign floating IP addresses to any network interface of the servers.\n\nThe following diagram shows an overview of IBM Cloud VPC.\n\nZoom\n\n![IBM VPC connectivity and security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/5bdb37c0149145723c5437e8176651928565e722/vmwaresolutions/images/vpc-ryo-diagrams-overview-virtual.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region. A region is also often referred to a multizone region or MZR.\n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center, which hosts the compute, network, storage resources, and the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other, so to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency. Each zone is assigned a default address prefix, which specifies the range of addresses in which subnets can be created.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vpc-ryo-vpc"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_11646-7-2246", "score": 24.689432, "text": "\nAutomating SAP workload deployment on IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Terraform and Ansible \n\nTerraform on IBM Cloud\u00ae enables predictable and consistent provisioning of IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex, cloud environments. IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware that uses Intel\u00ae Xeon CPUs and other Intel\u00ae technologies.\n\nYou can use Terraform scripts to create a single-tier VPC and create the SAP and SAP HANA in a distributed architecture on the bastion server that you create. Creating the bastion server is a prerequisite for all IBM SAP VPC automated solutions. The Terraform scripts use the VPC information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbook to create the SAP architecture on the specified VPC.\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud\u00ae VPC introduction \n\nA VPC is a public cloud offering that an enterprise uses to establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared [public cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/public) infrastructure. VPCs give an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.\n\nImagine that a cloud provider\u2019s infrastructure is a residential apartment building and multiple families live inside. Being a public cloud tenant is akin to sharing an apartment with a few roommates. In contrast, having a VPC is like having your own private condominium; no one else has the key, and no one can enter the space without your permission.\n\nA VPC\u2019s logical isolation is implemented by using virtual network functions and security features that give an enterprise customer granular control over which IP addresses or applications can access particular resources. It is analogous to the \u201cfriends-only\u201d or \u201cpublic/private\u201d controls on social media accounts used to restrict who can or can\u2019t see your otherwise public posts.\n\nWith IBM Cloud VPC, you can use the UI, CLI, and API to manually provision virtual server instances for VPC with high network performance. VPC infrastructure contains a number of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings, including virtual servers for VPC.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-automate-bw-4hana-overview"}]}

A relationship that you identify in this way between the intent and the entity is not used by the intent classification model. However, when you add the mention to the entity, it is also added to that entity as new value. And when you add the mention to an existing entity value, it is also added to that entity value as new synonym. Intent classification does use these types of dictionary references in intent user examples to establish a weak reference between an intent and an entity.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03373-2953-4766", "score": 13.621715, "text": "\nAfter you identify the list of steps, you can then focus on writing engaging content to turn each interaction into a positive experience for your customer.\n\n![Diagram of a simple exchange between a customer and an actions skill step.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/action-skill-explained.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers.

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support.

It contains a condition that must be met for the node to be processed by your assistant. At a minimum, it also contains a response. For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response. You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more.

It contains a condition that must be met for the node to be processed by your assistant. At a minimum, it also contains a response. For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response. You can define complex dialogs by adding conditional responses to a single node, adding child nodes that prolong the exchange with the user, and much more. (If you want to learn more about complex dialogs, you can complete the [Building a complex dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-tutorial) tutorial.)\n\nThe node that you will add in this step is one that contains slots.

For example, you might want to first check whether the input contains an intent, such as turn_on, and if it does, you might want to check whether the input contains entities, such as @lights, @radio, or @wipers.

Otherwise, you can create an infinite loop. If your assistant jumps to the earlier node and checks its condition, it is likely to return false because the same user input is being evaluated that triggered the current node last time through the dialog.

The accuracy of this vetted data, called ground truth or gold standard documents, is critical because inaccuracies in the ground truth will correlate to inaccuracies in the applications that rely on it.\n\nAn essential part of teaching Watson about a new domain involves providing it with knowledge about entities of interest in your domain content, the relationships between them, and how the entities co-reference each other.

For more details about other benefits of Subscription accounts, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n How subscription credit is spent \n\nSubscriptions can provide the following two types of credit, which are divided into separate pools:\n\n\n\n* Credit from platform subscriptions that pays for resource usage\n* Credit from support subscriptions that pays for support costs\n\n\n\nEach platform or support subscription is purchased for a given credit amount and duration. If the subscription duration is more than a year, the subscription is separated into terms of up to one year each. Each term has distinct start dates, end dates, and available credit. You can use the available credit at any point during the term, but credit doesn't roll over to any following terms in the subscription. You can get extra flexibility to use credit from terms that haven't yet started by paying up-front for the entire subscription rather than using monthly, quarterly, or another recurring billing cadence.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift.

To get metadata of the entire response object, which includes the HTTP response status code, use the following setting:\n\nwhisk.verboseReplies = true\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring the mobile SDK \n\nYou can configure the SDK to work with different installations of Cloud Functions by using the baseURL parameter. For instance:\n\nwhisk.baseURL = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n\nIn this example, you use an installation that is running at http://localhost:8080. If you do not specify the baseURL, the mobile SDK uses the instance that is running at [https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com](https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com).\n\nYou can pass in a custom NSURLSession in case you require special network handling. For example, you might have your own Cloud Functions installation that uses self-signed certificates:\n\n// create a network delegate that trusts everything\nclass NetworkUtilsDelegate: NSObject, NSURLSessionDelegate {\nfunc URLSession(session: NSURLSession, didReceiveChallenge challenge: NSURLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: (NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition, NSURLCredential?) -> Void) {\ncompletionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition.UseCredential, NSURLCredential(forTrust: challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust!))\n}\n}\n// create an NSURLSession that uses the trusting delegate", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-pkg_mobile_sdk"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10817-2884-4620", "score": 21.739855, "text": "\nInstall mobile SDK from source code \n\n\n\n1.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

For example, you might need to migrate data from old instances to new instances or update the credentials that are used for your app if you delete the Cloud Foundry alias.

The service can spot the same keyword multiple times and report each occurrence. The service spots keywords only in the final results, not in interim results. By default, the service does no keyword spotting.\n\nTo use keyword spotting, you must specify both of the following parameters:\n\n\n\n* Use the keywords parameter to specify an array of strings to be spotted. The service spots no keywords if you omit the parameter or specify an empty array. A keyword string can include more than one token. For example, the keyword Speech to Text has three tokens. Keyword matching is case-insensitive, so Speech to Text is effectively equivalent to speech to text.\n\nFor US English, the service normalizes each keyword to match spoken versus written strings. For example, it normalizes numbers to match how they are spoken as opposed to written. For other languages, keywords must be specified as they are spoken.\n* Use the keywords_threshold parameter to specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0 for a keyword match. The threshold indicates the lower bound for the level of confidence the service must have for a word to match the keyword. A keyword is spotted in the transcript only if its confidence is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.\n\nSpecifying a small threshold can potentially produce many matches. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. Omit the parameter to return no matches.\n\n\n\nThe following limits apply to keyword spotting:\n\n\n\n* You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request.\n* A single keyword can have a maximum length of 1024 characters.

The short-form model is trained to recognize the short utterances that are frequently expressed in customer support settings like automated support call centers. In addition to being tuned for short utterances in general, the model is also tuned for precise utterances such as digits, single-character word and name spellings, and yes-no responses.\n\nThe en-US_ShortForm_NarrowbandModel is optimal for the kinds of responses that are common to human-to-machine exchanges, such as the use case of IBM\u00ae Voice Agent with Watson\u2122. The en-US_NarrowbandModel is generally optimal for human-to-human conversations. However, depending on the use case and the nature of the exchange, some users might find the short-form model suitable for human-to-human conversations as well. Given this flexibility and overlap, you might experiment with both models to determine which works best for your application. In either case, applying a custom language model with a grammar to the short-form model can further improve recognition results.\n\nAs with all models, noisy environments can adversely impact the results. For example, background acoustic noise from airports, moving vehicles, conference rooms, and multiple speakers can reduce transcription accuracy. Audio from speaker phones can also reduce accuracy due to the echo common to such devices. Using the parameters available for speech activity detection can counteract such effects and help improve speech transcription accuracy.

To list available zones in the region, run ibmcloud is zones.\n* IP addresses: VPC subnets provide private IP addresses for your worker nodes and load balancer services in your cluster, so make sure to [create a subnet with enough IP addresses](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnetsvpc_basics_subnets), such as 256. You can't change the number of IP addresses that a VPC subnet has later.\n* Public gateways: You don't need to attach a public gateway to complete this tutorial. Instead, you can keep your worker nodes isolated from public access by using VPC load balancers to expose workloads securely. You might attach a public gateway if your worker nodes need to access a public URL. For more information, see [Planning your cluster network setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters).\n\n\n\nibmcloud is subnet-create mysubnet1 <vpc_ID> --zone us-south-1 --ipv4-address-count 256\n\n\n\n3.

Each worker node that you add in a cluster is deployed with a private IP address from the VPC subnet in that zone. After the worker node is provisioned, the worker node IP address persists after a reboot operation, but the worker node IP address changes after replace and update operations.\n\nSubnets provide a channel for connectivity among the worker nodes within the cluster. Additionally, any system that is connected to any of the private subnets in the same VPC can communicate with workers. For example, all subnets in one VPC can communicate through private layer 3 routing with a built-in VPC router. If you have multiple clusters that must communicate with each other, you can create the clusters in the same VPC. However, if your clusters don't need to communicate, you can achieve better network segmentation by creating the clusters in separate VPCs. You can also create [access control lists (ACLs)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-acls) for your VPC subnets to mediate traffic on the private network. ACLs consist of inbound and outbound rules that define which ingress and egress is permitted for each VPC subnet.\n\nIf your worker nodes must access a public endpoint outside of the cluster, you can enable a public gateway on the VPC subnet that the worker nodes are deployed to.

Billing stops automatically when you stop the instance. The suspend billing feature helps you reduce cost and prevents you from having to re-create an instance when you need its resources again.\n\nIn situations where you want to scale your infrastructure up and down in response to workload needs, you can stop an instance (and stop billing) as a faster alternative to creating and deleting instances.\n\n\n\n Billing details \n\nIt's important to understand what costs stop accruing and what costs persist when your virtual server instance is powered off.\n\nReview the following table for details on how suspended billing impacts various resource charges.\n\n\n\nTable 7.

In other words, a usage discount applies only to the time the image is in use, not to the time the image was suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing invoice \n\nWhen you suspend billing on a virtual server, you see a few changes in your billing invoice. The relevant charges now appear as usage-based details. For example, you might see the following additions that reflect hours available, hours that instances were used, and total number of hours charged:\n\nComputing instance usage...\nRAM usage...\nOperating system usage...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Resource details \n\n\n\n Storage \n\nWhen you suspend billing on a virtual server instance, the associated storage persists, but you can't access data while the virtual server instance is powered off.

Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources.\n\nWith Subscription accounts, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For more information about the differences between account types, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota? \n\nWhen you reach any quota for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended. Quotas are based per org and not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org show any usage from previous instances.

You can customize the number of instances and the amount of memory per instance based on your needs. You can also add memory or instances to scale for more users. To get the amount charged, take your application instances that are multiplied by memory per instance and by hours running.\n\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

Not only is tracking your subscriptions easier, but you can get fewer, larger subscriptions for a better discount because the credit is shared.\n* Top-down usage reporting gives you a unified view of usage costs from all accounts, organized according to your enterprise hierarchy.\n\n\n\nIf you have multiple accounts, at least one of which is a Subscription account, you can create an enterprise.

Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team.\n\n\n\n* You give your financial officer access to view the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department.\n* You give each department lead access to view usage for everything in their department's account group.\n* You give each team lead access to view only the accounts in their team's account group.\n\n\n\nBecause access in the enterprise is separate from access in each account, enterprise users can't automatically manage resources within the child accounts. Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API. For more information, see [Viewing usage in an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Invoicing and payments \n\nUsage in the enterprise is invoiced through the enterprise account. As with all billable accounts, usage is invoiced monthly, and the invoice is due on the billing date for your account. During each billing cycle, a single invoice with the usage costs from all accounts is made available in the enterprise account. The invoice contains costs for all platform and infrastructure usage as a single-line item in your invoice.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03776-3313-5682", "score": 24.051973, "text": "\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model. This billing model is similar to a Subscription account with a few added benefits. The following table details the two billable account types and billing model.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Comparative analysis of account types\n\n Pay-As-You-Go Subscription Enterprise Savings Plan \n\n Monthly billing Timely billing Timely billing \n Invoiced on monthly consumption Invoices independent of usage Invoiced on monthly consumption \n Best suited for developers and companies Best suited for enterprise organizations Best suited for both developers and enterprise organizations \n\n\n\n\n\n Estimating your costs \n\nAfter you select the type of account that fits your organization's needs, it's time to understand how you will be charged for it. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

Subscription credit must be added to the enterprise account, where it becomes part of the enterprise credit pool.\n\n\n\n Billing transition when importing accounts \n\nWhen you import an existing account to an enterprise, its billing and invoicing transitions to being managed by the enterprise account.

This change reflects that the account does not have its own subscriptions, but it still has full access to production-ready, billable services.\n* Subscriptions and promotions from each account are moved to the enterprise account, where they become part of the credit pool. After the move, each subscription has the same remaining credit and term period, but the subscription is given a new unique ID.\n* Access to billing and payment information for future billing periods is restricted to users in the enterprise account. Users in a child account can't access billing and payment information, such as invoices, payments, or subscriptions, even if they previously had access in the account. To view or manage billing, users need to be invited to the enterprise account and given access to the Billing service in that account.\n* Usage is invoiced to the enterprise account for the entire month when the account was added. For example, if you add an account to the enterprise on 15 June, all of the usage for the month of June is reflected in the July invoice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shared credit pool \n\nThe enterprise credit pool consolidates credit from all accounts in the enterprise and shares it with the accounts. The pool includes credit from all sources, including platform subscription credit, promotional credit, and support credit.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise&interface=ui"}]}

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice.

Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test?

Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 19.888796, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 14.373378, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04146-2946-5057", "score": 12.592393, "text": "\nAvailable Cloudflare fields\n\n Field name Type Example value Notes \n\n cf.client.bot Boolean true This field indicates whether the request is coming from a known bot or crawler, regardless of good or bad intent. \n cf.threat_score Number A 0-100 value This field represents a risk score, 0 indicates low risk as determined by Cloudflare.

If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate).

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}]}

In addition, each new release will support running models that were trained on the version prior to that so that upgrading won't impact your runtime.

In this case, Watson Assistant automatically retrains your assistant to the Latest version. This automatic retraining is required to assure your ability to run your trained models in your next upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practices \n\nIt's recommended to use the Latest version in your production deployment of Watson Assistant for IBM Cloud Pak for Data. This is the default for newly-created assistants. During an upgrade, your settings don't automatically switch existing assistants to use the latest version. If prior to your upgrade you had selected Latest, your settings continue to use that version, now labeled as Previous. After you upgrade, it's recommended you choose Latest and run basic regression tests.\n\nIBM performs robust testing on a variety of data sets to minimize impacts on existing assistants. But given the nature of machine learning models and the nuance and subtlety of natural languages processing, you may find some discrepancies from version to version. If you find a major issue through your tests, you have the ability to switch your settings and use Previous to return to the prior behavior. In this event, we recommend you contact IBM and provide details of your test so that that IBM can support you in the steps to resolve the problem.\n\nIt's also recommended that you try the Beta version in one of your test systems after you upgrade. This gives you early visibility to changes that are likely to be delivered in a future version, and will reduce the probability of negative impacts to your production systems.

A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "score": 17.538687, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 17.431185, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

For more information, see [Protect sensitive input variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables).\n\nThe following example shows a configuration that you can use to create an arbitrary secret by setting sensitive values in a terraform.tfvars file.\n\n\n\n1.

Assign a value to the arbitrary_secret_payload variable in a terraform.tfvars file.\n\nBy setting values with a .tfvars file, you can separate sensitive values from the rest of your variable values, and ensure that your users who work with your configuration know which values are sensitive. For security purposes, you must maintain and share the .tfvars file only with your users who have the appropriate access. You must also be careful not to store .tfvars files with sensitive values into version control such as Github, in clear text.\n\narbitrary_secret_payload = \"my sensitive arbitrary payload\"\n3.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12417-2921-4069", "score": 15.248902, "text": "\n6.

Do not redact the information or replace it wholesale with variables. For best results, replace the real information with fake information of the same type.\n\nFor example, if the PII that you want to protect is client names, then instead of redacting each name or replacing each name with a variable, such as USER_NAME, replace each name with a fake name that uses a variety of typical name syntax styles, such as Jane Doe, Mr. Smith, Dietrich, or Dr. Jones, PhD. Consider writing a script that concatenates a variety of first and last names, and titles and last names, and adds last names alone to create fake names that can be inserted into the document to replace instances of real user names. The goal is to simulate as closely as possible real values in the source documents. If the same text (USER_NAME) is used in the documents or text is redacted, you will basically be training the model to expect all names to have that same value or be redacted.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

To protect your app, you must protect the image and establish checks to ensure the image's integrity.\n\nShould I use a public or a private registry to store my images?\n: Public registries, such as Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker images and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09410-1574-3779", "score": 17.26875, "text": "\n* IBM Cloud Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM.\n* The IBM Cloud Container Registry includes Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.

The agent collects logs of all the pods in the node. The resource requirements of the agent are in direct relation to the number of pods for each node and the amount of logs produced for each pod.\n\nThe agent requires at least 128 MB and no more than 512 MB of memory. It requires at least twenty millicpu (20m).\n\nDifferent features can also increase resource utilization. When line exclusion, inclusion or redaction rules are specified, you can expect additional CPU consumption for each line and regex rule defined. When Kubernetes event logging is enabled (disabled by default), additional CPU usage will occur on the oldest agent pod.\n\nPlacing traffic shaping or CPU limits on the agent is not recommended to ensure data can be sent to the log ingestion service.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding image tags \n\nThe tag that is associated to a logging image indicates whether the logging agent is automatically updated.\n\nA tag consists of multiple parts:\n\nX.Y.Z-<date>.[hash]\n\nWhere\n\n\n\n* X represents the major version of an image.\n* Y represents the minor version of an image.\n* Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.\n* <date> represents the date that the image is built and available.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret. For more information about image pull secrets, see [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).\n\n\n\n Types of image registries \n\nImages are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry).\n\nPublic registries, such as public Docker Hub, can be used to get started with Docker and Code Engine to create your first application or job. But when it comes to enterprise workloads, use a private registry, such as the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users.

For example, IBM Cloud Container Registry and Docker Hub are container registries. A container registry can be public or private. A container registry that is public does not require credentials to access. In contrast, accessing a private registry does require credentials.\n\nCode Engine requires access to container registries to complete the following actions:\n\n\n\n* To retrieve (or \"pull\") a container image to run an app or job\n* To store a newly created container image as an output of an image build\n* To store and retrieve local files when a build is run from local source\n\n\n\nCode Engine handles many of the underlying details of the interactions between the system and your registry.\n\nTo pull images from a registry, Code Engine uses a special type of Kubernetes secret that is called an imagePullSecret. This image pull secret stores the credentials to access a container registry. When you add access to a container registry with Code Engine to pull images, you are creating an image pull secret.

After you set a quota, users must include resource requests and limits in their deployments.\n\n\n\n\n\n Organize your Kubernetes objects with labels \n\nTo organize and select your Kubernetes resources such as pods or nodes, [use Kubernetes labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/). By default, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud applies some labels, including arch, os, region, zone, and machine-type.\n\nExample use cases for labels include [limiting network traffic to edge worker nodes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-edge), [deploying an app to a GPU machine](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-deploy_appgpu_app), and [restricting your app workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/) to run on worker nodes that meet certain flavor or SDS capabilities, such as bare metal worker nodes.

For example, IBM manages and automatically applies updates to your cluster master. For your worker nodes, IBM provides security and version updates, but you must apply the updates. You are also responsible for your workload applications and data. For more information, see [Your responsibilities while using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks).\n\n\n\n\n\n What if some part of the service fails to comply with a recommendation? \n\nFirst, check the explanation of the failure for any remediation steps.\n\nThen, determine whether the failure is acceptable according to your security requirements. For example, some recommendations might be more in-depth configuration requirements than your particular processes or standards require. Also, some recommendations are not scored, and don't impact the overall benchmark score.\n\nNext, decide whether the component falls within your responsibility. If so, you might need to change how you configure that component. For example, you might configure pod security policies for all your app deployments. For components that are not directly within your responsibility, assess whether you can use another IBM Cloud service to meet the recommendation.\n\n\n\n\n\n What else can I do to increase the security and compliance of my cluster? \n\nSee [Security for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Running the worker node CIS Kubernetes benchmark \n\nTo review the results of the CIS Kubernetes benchmark for Section 4: Worker node security configuration, you can run the test yourself. Because you own the worker nodes and are partially [responsible](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks) for their compliance, you might make configuration changes that you want to validate on your own.\n\nBefore you begin: [Log in to your account.

Then, researchers and data analysts from everywhere can download data sets and do their own analysis.\n\nDevelopers started by deploying their research-sharing SaaS apps in containers with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. They created clusters for a Development environment that allow worldwide Developers to collaboratively deploy app improvements quickly.\n\nSecurity first: The Development Exec chose bare metal to host the research clusters. With bare metal for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, the sensitive research workloads now have familiar isolation but within the flexibility of public cloud. Because this nonprofit also has a partnership with pharmaceutical companies, app security is crucial. Competition is fierce, and corporate espionage is possible.

For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted. Compute in clusters is tamper-proof and isolated to bare metal.\n\nTechnical solution:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service\n* IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions\n* IBM Cloudant\n* IBM\u00ae Secure Gateway for IBM Cloud\u00ae", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_uc_health"}]}

All containers that make up your microservice are grouped into pods, a logical unit to ensure easy management and discovery. These pods run on compute hosts that are managed in a Kubernetes cluster that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failures.\n\nFor more information about Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer<=vel=foundational).\n\n\n\n\n\n How does IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service work? \n\nWith IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_01545-6013-8003", "score": 19.933193, "text": "\n[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a container orchestrator to manage the lifecycle of containerized apps in a cluster of worker nodes.

The provider also wanted to counteract increasing labor costs and a decreasing budget.\n\nThey started by containerizing their SaaS systems and putting them in the cloud. From that first step, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the SaaS apps, they easily designed Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. Another factor for decreased staff costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the provider can focus on delivering better customer service.\n\nAccelerated development is a key win for the IT Exec. With the move to public cloud, Developers can experiment easily with Node.js SDK, pushing changes to Development and Test systems, scaled out on separate clusters. Those pushes were automated with open toolchains and IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery. Updates to the SaaS system no longer languished in slow, error-prone build processes. The Developers can deliver incremental updates to their users, daily or even more frequently. Also, logging and monitoring for the SaaS systems, especially how the patient front-end and back-end reports interact, rapidly integrate into the system.

Other services that run on the private network can access your app by using the private IP address of the NodePort service.\n\nkubectl expose deployment/hello-world-deployment --type=NodePort --name=hello-world-service --port=8080 --target-port=8080\n\nExample output\n\nservice/hello-world-service exposed\n\n\n\nTable 1. Information about the command options.\n\n Parameter Description \n\n expose Expose a Kubernetes resource, such as a deployment, as a Kubernetes service so that users can access the resource by using the IP address of the service. \n deployment/<hello-world-deployment> The resource type and the name of the resource to expose with this service. \n --name=<hello-world-service> The name of the service. \n --type=NodePort The service type to create. In this lesson, you create a NodePort service. In the following lesson, you create a LoadBalancer service. \n --port=<8080> The port on which the service listens for external network traffic. \n --target-port=<8080> The port that your app listens on and to which the service directs incoming network traffic. In this example, the target-port is the same as the port, but other apps that you create might use a different port. \n\n\n\n7. Now that all the deployment work is done, you can test your app from within the cluster. Get the details to form the private IP address that you can use to access your app.\n\n\n\n1. Get information about the service to see which NodePort was assigned. The NodePorts are randomly assigned when they are generated with the expose command, but within 30000-32767. In this example, the NodePort is 30872.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc_ks_tutorial"}]}

With the HTTP interfaces, you can stream the audio or send it all at once.\n* [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-inputtimeouts) are used by the service to ensure an active flow of data during audio streaming. When you initiate a streaming session, the service enforces inactivity and session timeouts from which your application must recover gracefully. If a timeout lapses during a streaming session, the service closes the connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interim results and low latency \n\n\n\n* [Interim results](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-interiminterim-results) are intermediate hypotheses that the service returns as transcription progresses.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-features"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13429-163247-165127", "score": 19.117243, "text": "\nThe WebSocket section also discusses the maximum frame or message size of 4 MB enforced by the WebSocket interface.\n\nHTTP and WebSocket interfaces can now return warnings\n: The JSON response for a recognition request can now include an array of warning messages for invalid query parameters or JSON fields that are included with a request.

Be sure that you understand the security implications of the customizations that you want to make before you make them.\n\n\n\n Understanding custom claims mapping \n\nA claim is a statement that an entity makes about itself or on behalf of someone else. For example, if you signed into an application by using an identity provider, the provider would send the application a group of claims or statements about you to the app so that it can group with information that it already knows about you. This way, when you sign in, the app is set up with your information, in the way that you configured it.\n\n\n\n What types of claims can I define? \n\nThe claims that are provided by App ID fall into several categories that are differentiated by their level of customization.\n\nNormalized claims\n: In each identity token, there is a set of claims that is recognized by App ID as normalized. When available, the claims are mapped directly from your identity provider to the token by default. The claims can't be explicitly omitted but they can be overwritten in your token by custom claims. The claims include name, email, picture, and locale.\n\nRestricted claims\n: Restricted claims are those that have limited customization possibilities and cannot be overwritten by custom mappings. For an access token, scope is the only restricted claim. Although it cannot be overwritten, it can be extended with your own scope.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-customizing-tokens"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13652-8279-9663", "score": 17.554699, "text": "\n\"customization_id\": \"63f5807f-a4f2-5766-914e-7abb1a84fe97\",\n\"owner\": \"297cfd08-330a-22ba-93ce-1a73f454dd98\",\n\"created\": \"2016-07-15T18:12:31.743Z\",\n\"name\": \"Test Two\",\n\"language\": \"en-US\",\n\"description\": \"Second customization test\",\n\"last_modified\": \"2016-07-15T18:23:50.912Z\"\n}\n]\n}\nShow more\n\nThe created and last_modified times for the first model are the same because it has yet to be updated.

If you have an existing phone integration, you must delete it and create a new one to switch to a free phone number.\n* You can connect to a contact center with live agents. For more information about setting up the integration, see [Integrating with phone and NICE CXone contact center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-nicecxone).\n* You can use and connect an existing number by configuring a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunk from a provider such as Genesys, IntelePeer, or Twilio.\n\n\n\nA SIP trunk is equivalent to an analog telephone line, except it uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) to transmit voice data and can support multiple concurrent calls. The trunk can connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or your company's on-premises private branch exchange (PBX).\n\nWhen a customer makes a phone call using the telephone number connected to your assistant, the phone integration makes it possible for your assistant to answer. The integration converts output from your assistant into voice audio by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Text to Speech service, and the audio is sent to the telephone network through the SIP trunk. When the customer replies, the voice input is converted into text by using the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16289-4293-5909", "score": 17.132215, "text": "\n5.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. For more information, see [Configuring backup call center support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-transfer-service).\n* Call failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent.\n\n\n\nIf, after you transfer the call to a human, the connection to a live agent fails for any reason, you can configure what to do.\n\n\n\n* Transfer failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller if transfer to a live agent fails. The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-config"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16250-3559-5929", "score": 15.819211, "text": "\nA failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur. To support disaster recovery, the service provider may need to configure two separate SIP trunks, one for each region, and only when all the zones in a single region fail should the call be switched to the backup region. It's important to set the SIP INVITE failure timeouts at the SIP trunking provider low enough to avoid long call setup latencies when a failover is occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partial service outage \n\nThe second type of failure is a partial service outage within the region.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-failover"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03312-3639-6036", "score": 15.818506, "text": "\nA Watson Assistant phone integration in one region is unaware of a phone integration in a different region. You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions.

A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions.

Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system.

This strategy includes workloads in both the private cloud and multiple external cloud environments, such as the public cloud or a cloud managed by a service provider. Most enterprises are also faced with the challenge of protecting an ever-increasing attack surface while simultaneously maintaining compliance with industry and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nTo protect this expanding attack surface, enterprises need continuous visibility into workloads from the start until the end of their lifecycle. Enterprises must maintain a \u201cfull-stack\u201d understanding of the workload vulnerabilities and configuration issues at the infrastructure, platform, and application level in the context of threats and compliance requirements. Enterprises need predictive analytics to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d to give a proactive view of their cyberrisk and compliance risk posture in this vast, new hybrid world.\n\nCaveonix RiskForesight\u2122 provides proactive workload protection from risks due to cyberthreats and regulatory compliance issues. It provides real-time visibility into what is running in an enterprise\u2019s hybrid cloud through native integration into cloud orchestration platforms. Combining such visibility with risk reduction models and enforcement actions that can be automated, RiskForesight quickly develops a prioritized list of actions to mitigate. RiskForesight is a multitenant-aware hybrid cloud workload protection platform that implements a proactive risk management framework. This framework can operate at multiple control planes: network, compute, security, and compliance, while the implementation of the framework at cloud scale is automated.\n\nThe platform is fully integrated into the VMware\u00ae technology stack from vCD, vRA, vCenter to NSX and many public clouds. The RiskForesight platform has three key modules: Detect, Predict, and Act, providing 360-degree visibility into hybrid cloud workloads in real time by natively integrating into hybrid cloud orchestration modules.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12467-1716-3849", "score": 14.171062, "text": "\n* When you try to modify or delete a secret while it is locked, Secrets Manager denies the request with an HTTP 412 Precondition Failed response. You see an error message similar to the following example:\n\nThe requested action can't be completed because the secret version is locked.\n\nIf you're working with\n\ndynamic secrets, such as IAM credentials, locking your secrets also means that by default, those secrets can't be read or accessed. For more information, see [Why can't I read a locked IAM credentials secret?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-locked-iam-credentials)\n* If a locked secret reaches its expiration date, it stays in the Active state and its data remains accessible to your applications. Secrets Manager moves the secret to the Destroyed state and permanently deletes the expired secret data only after all locks on the secret are removed.\n\nSSL/TLS certificates still reach their defined expiration dates and move into a Destroyed state even if they are locked. For more information, see [Why did my locked certificate move to the Destroyed state?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-locked-certificates)\n* If you try to rotate a secret while its current version is locked and the previous version is unlocked (or if an automatic rotation is scheduled), the request to rotate the secret is allowed.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

A lifecycle manager can then control the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans through the API Manager. Through the Developer Portal, the customer is then able to subscribe to one of the Plans that is available to them, as determined in the API Manager. If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost.

That trend amount of $1043.75 USD is the predicted next month's usage, with the following calculations:\n\n\n\n* Change between August and July = $1012.50 - $1000.00 = $12.50 USD\n* Change between July and June = $1000.00 - $950.00 = $50.00 USD\n* Average change (trend) = ($12.50 + $50.00) / 2 = $31.25 USD\n\n\n\nAugust usage ($1012.50) + Average change ($31.25) = The predicted usage for next month September ($1043.75 USD)\n\n\n\n\n\n Viewing usage details from the usage page \n\nIn the Services section, you can view a list of your services and the estimated costs that are associated with those services.

In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-charges"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03729-6519-8345", "score": 15.808152, "text": "\nHowever, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.
